00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.710 
much sense if they only brought ps4
or<00:02:00.530> other<00:02:00.830> if<00:02:00.979> they<00:02:01.100> only<00:02:01.250> brought<00:02:01.430> Vita<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.450> if

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
or other if they only brought Vita so if

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.960 
or other if they only brought Vita so if
it<00:02:03.050> has<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.260> Vita<00:02:03.590> if<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.310> Vita<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.670> most

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
it has a Vita if it is the Vita it most

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.330 
it has a Vita if it is the Vita it most
likely<00:02:05.060> be<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.600> ps4<00:02:06.080> as<00:02:06.350> well<00:02:06.500> but<00:02:06.979> either<00:02:07.159> way

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
likely be the ps4 as well but either way

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.279 
likely be the ps4 as well but either way
we<00:02:07.460> just<00:02:07.490> we<00:02:07.909> do<00:02:08.149> not<00:02:08.300> have<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.539> confirmation<00:02:08.929> of

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
we just we do not have a confirmation of

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.530 
we just we do not have a confirmation of
which<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:09.920> which<00:02:10.160> version<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.360> let's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
which one which version it is so let's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.110 
which one which version it is so let's
just<00:02:11.720> hope<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.740> PlayStation<00:02:13.459> Vita<00:02:13.760> and
