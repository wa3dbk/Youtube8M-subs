00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.160
 in this case the work 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.439
 research that we are doing 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.140
 right now it's about chili production 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.820
 habanero plus greenhouse conditions 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.680
 although it is true that the is the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.660
 infrastructure or the infrastructure that 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.119
 we have protected agriculture in this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.309
 case the greenhouse area supports or 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.500
 help in this research project 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.329
 it's because good under conditions of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.770
 open sky 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.110
 in this region of San QuintÃ­n Valley 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.420
 we could not produce this 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.820
 crop because it is a crop of 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 tropical climate where it requires high 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.289
 high amounts of light high amounts 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.719
 temperatures to be able to develop 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.100
 So that's the situation that 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.760
 protected agriculture is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 benefiting 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.870
 the project is within a line of 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.090
 generation of application to knowledge 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.310
 which is called genetic improvement and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.670
 Crop production under conditions 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 of greenhouses 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.860
 the specific project is the evaluation 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 of yield in the cultivation of chili 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 Havana and its generational progress because 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.600
 because in 2013 we started to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 work with habanero chile for 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.020
 research and educational purposes 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 also for the students to go 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.979
 acquiring knowledge about 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.810
 to agronomic management at all 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.610
 conditions that this crop demands 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 to be able to increase their yields 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.549
 in the Yucatan region where this 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 characteristic to the production that is the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.600
 perfect climate to produce if the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.630
 habanero to open field produce between 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 18 and 20 tons per hectare we 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 experimentally goes with these 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.039
 conditions and implementing a program 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.840
 of fertigation we got around 70 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.000
 tons per hectare then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 we tripled the performance they 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.850
 they get there and because we went back to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.009
 establish because we need to have what 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.989
 three consecutive years establish the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 three consecutive years for now without 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.930
 give 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.210
 guarantee that really under these 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.980
 conditions in this type of soil and 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.300
 under these structures as the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 performance of habanero chili is very 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 raised its potential is very good from that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.570
 hybrid we did auto 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.350
 fertilizations and we produce the seed of 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.410
 f2 then in this batch we have both 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.420
 the hybrid like the one in the f2 to the children 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.010
 of free of the next generation and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.360
 we will also evaluate segregation 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.200
 then we are doing a double 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.970
 research purpose of production and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 while segregation that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.140
 manifests in the following 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.030
 generations, we involve the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.680
 students without starting from fourth 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.300
 fifth semester for the subject of 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.890
 genetic students see the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.570
 segregation for the production of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.430
 seeds the students learn the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.380
 All seed production process 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.989
 the guidelines and all the conditions 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.510
 what they need to do to make them 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.150
 come out better prepared bring that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.890
 that vision of the professional life of the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 practice ok yes I take the matter of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.940
 seed production operative me 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.130
 they say very nice that you have to keep 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.660
 these insulation and so on 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.310
 but that they also see it in the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.350
 practice then for that also the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.910
 They help in your projects in the area 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
 matter of genetic improvement 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 plants to ok well let's do 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.450
 crossings let's see how you how 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.460
 he behaves if he crossed this material with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.560
 this if crossing an F1 with a hybrid 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.750
 etc. etcetera all students 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.270
 also in those three subjects and four 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.550
 matters when physically they 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.080
 They learn the area or what is being 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.390
 the professional competence that is 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 learn to do what they are 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.380
 seeing in theory 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.349
