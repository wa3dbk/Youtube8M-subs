00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
so we had to it's quite thick and yeah

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
so we had to it's quite thick and yeah
the<00:02:46.530> only<00:02:46.620> problem<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.340> day<00:02:47.549> is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the only problem with this day is

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.849 
the only problem with this day is
literally<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> back<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.739> it's

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
literally the back as you can see it's

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.580 
literally the back as you can see it's
quite<00:02:49.980> small<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.689> pace<00:02:51.930> you're<00:02:52.409> gonna

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
quite small so the pace you're gonna

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.379 
quite small so the pace you're gonna
have<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.069> either<00:02:53.250> hammering<00:02:53.819> or<00:02:54.060> tight

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
have to are either hammering or tight

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.780 
have to are either hammering or tight
until<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:55.049> bends<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> deckle<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.489> really

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
until it bends the deckle but really

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.069 
until it bends the deckle but really
there's<00:02:57.120> no<00:02:57.269> problems<00:02:57.750> there<00:02:58.790> yeah<00:02:59.840> Dex<00:03:00.840> last

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
so I don't really know if that means

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.229 
so I don't really know if that means
anything<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> yeah<00:03:14.209> yeah<00:03:16.579> it's<00:03:17.579> just

an overall really good deck the weight

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.119 
an overall really good deck the weight
on<00:03:19.979> its<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.459> probably<00:03:21.239> mean<00:03:21.659> category<00:03:22.409> he

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
on its like probably mean category he
