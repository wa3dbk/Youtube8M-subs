00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
think a lot of that is just um it music

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
think a lot of that is just um it music
sets<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> tone<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> were<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
sets the tone because if you were to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
sets the tone because if you were to
watch<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> video<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.039> machinima<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> mute

watch this video this machinima and mute
it<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.100> complete<00:01:02.399> shit

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.260 
it's playing but they're just a couple
little<00:01:22.380> nitpicky<00:01:22.920> things<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.520> I'd<00:01:23.880> really

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
little nitpicky things where I'd really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
little nitpicky things where I'd really
like<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> change<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.409> Paul

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
like to change it and I could have Paul

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
like to change it and I could have Paul
to<00:01:25.799> polish<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> off<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.210> didn't<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to polish it off a lot more but didn't I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.270 
to polish it off a lot more but didn't I
really<00:01:28.619> didn't<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:28.890> it'd<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
really didn't think it'd be this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
really didn't think it'd be this
successful<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:30.030> mean<00:01:30.210> machine<00:01:31.110> omona<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> i

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
successful I mean machine omona that i

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
successful I mean machine omona that i
thought<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.340> made<00:01:32.549> better<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.390> 200

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
thought was made better is out like 200

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740 
thought was made better is out like 200
views<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.860> 200<00:01:35.280> views<00:01:35.430> right<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.600> i

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
views not even 200 views right now but i

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.319 
views not even 200 views right now but i
guess<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.610> had<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.000> black

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
guess just that it had to do with black

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
guess just that it had to do with black
ops<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> dolphin<00:01:40.140> dives<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> kind

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
ops and dolphin dives and this is kind

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
ops and dolphin dives and this is kind
of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> couple<00:01:42.299> months<00:01:42.390> after<00:01:42.750> black<00:01:42.960> ops<00:01:43.200> came

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
of a couple months after black ops came

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380 
of a couple months after black ops came
out<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.890> black<00:01:44.549> ops<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.180> being

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
out so black ops was still being

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
out so black ops was still being
searched<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.960> lot<00:01:46.399> but<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
searched a lot but I think that's just

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.149 
searched a lot but I think that's just
one<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> reasons<00:01:49.200> why<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:49.950> popular

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
one of the reasons why I was so popular

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
one of the reasons why I was so popular
and<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.729> still<00:01:50.909> getting<00:01:51.180> some<00:01:51.420> good

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and it's still getting some good

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
and it's still getting some good
attention<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.460> anyways<00:01:53.460> guys<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.939> actually

doesn't seem like a big thing at the
time<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:25.000> when<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.300> sync<00:02:25.599> up<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> camera

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
time but when you sync up the camera

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.670 
time but when you sync up the camera
angles<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:26.800> big<00:02:27.519> big<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.870> guess<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.349> just<00:02:29.590> say

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680

horns<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.590> song<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.269> really<00:02:34.810> just

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
horns in this song but it really just

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.680 
horns in this song but it really just
puts<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.980> nice<00:02:36.280> finalized<00:02:36.970> touch<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.540> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
puts that nice finalized touch on it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.870 
puts that nice finalized touch on it
that<00:02:38.050> makes<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.349> look<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.400> i'm

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
that makes it look really well so i'm

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.970 
that makes it look really well so i'm
going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.360> stay<00:02:40.930> quiet<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.440> next<00:02:41.620> second

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
going to stay quiet for this next second

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:53.640 
going to stay quiet for this next second
so<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.610> see<00:02:42.940> that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.650 

now<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.740> can<00:02:54.980> see<00:02:55.160> how<00:02:55.370> nice<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.610> looks<00:02:55.880> when

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
now you can see how nice that looks when

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.600 
now you can see how nice that looks when
it's<00:02:56.690> actually<00:02:57.050> done<00:02:57.470> because<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.460> don't

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
it's actually done because you don't

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.710 
it's actually done because you don't
really<00:02:58.640> think<00:02:58.850> about<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.180> when<00:02:59.270> it's<00:02:59.420> when

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
really think about it when it's when

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.060 
really think about it when it's when
you're<00:02:59.840> editing<00:02:59.960> it<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:00.680> when<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.950> actually

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you're editing it but when you actually

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.830 
you're editing it but when you actually
watch<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.580> final<00:03:01.850> product<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.420> those<00:03:02.630> aren't

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
watch the final product if those aren't

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.150 
watch the final product if those aren't
synced<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.650> you're<00:03:03.740> not<00:03:03.830> even<00:03:04.010> thinking

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
synced up and you're not even thinking

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.860 
synced up and you're not even thinking
about<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.330> those<00:03:05.450> random

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
about it and you just have those random

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.740 
about it and you just have those random
booms<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.860> just<00:03:07.370> has<00:03:07.760> no<00:03:07.910> significance<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
booms it just has no significance on the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.180 
booms it just has no significance on the
video<00:03:08.960> whatsoever<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.740> think<00:03:09.980> having

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
video whatsoever but I think having

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.130 
video whatsoever but I think having
those<00:03:10.370> booms<00:03:10.700> flipping<00:03:11.690> over<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.020> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
those booms flipping over in the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.720 
those booms flipping over in the
different<00:03:12.440> camera<00:03:12.710> angles<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.160> think<00:03:13.610> that

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
different camera angles I think that

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.890 
different camera angles I think that
looks<00:03:13.850> really<00:03:14.030> well<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
looks really well if you have the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
looks really well if you have the
editing<00:03:15.170> skills<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.620> do<00:03:15.710> it<00:03:15.830> now<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.430> nit

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
editing skills to do it now the nit

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.130 
editing skills to do it now the nit
picky<00:03:16.910> stuff<00:03:17.270> that<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> was<00:03:17.600> talking<00:03:17.720> about

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
picky stuff that I was talking about

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.240 
picky stuff that I was talking about
where<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.380> really<00:03:18.740> want<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.920> go<00:03:19.070> back<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
where I really want to go back and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.040 
where I really want to go back and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.450 
change it it's just something like this
right<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.410> here<00:03:21.590> when<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> start<00:03:22.100> playing<00:03:22.310> this

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
right up here when I start playing this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.130 
right up here when I start playing this
clip<00:03:22.760> you'll<00:03:23.270> notice<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.810> guys<00:03:23.930> running

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
clip you'll notice that the guys running

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.300 
clip you'll notice that the guys running
a<00:03:24.350> little<00:03:24.620> slower<00:03:24.890> than<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.130> actual

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
a little slower than the actual

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.220 
a little slower than the actual
sprinting<00:03:25.970> speed<00:03:26.120> because<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> actually<00:03:26.870> had

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
sprinting speed because I actually had

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.100 
sprinting speed because I actually had
to<00:03:27.380> slow<00:03:27.770> down<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.730> clip<00:03:29.210> item<00:03:29.570> put<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.990> in<00:03:30.050> a

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
to slow down the clip item put it in a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.530 
to slow down the clip item put it in a
bit<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.350> slow<00:03:30.710> mo<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.730> make<00:03:31.880> sure<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.120> fit

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
bit of slow mo just to make sure I fit

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.960 
bit of slow mo just to make sure I fit
that<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.780> fog<00:03:33.380> horn<00:03:33.410> but<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:34.160> think<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.790> turned

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that a fog horn but I think it turned

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.310 
that a fog horn but I think it turned
out<00:03:35.090> well<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.450> don't<00:03:35.630> notice<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.960> that<00:03:36.140> much

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
out well you don't notice it that much

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.690 
out well you don't notice it that much
but<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:36.920> small<00:03:37.160> things<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.520> make

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
but it's just so small things that make

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.820 
but it's just so small things that make
a<00:03:37.760> difference<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:42.080> all<00:03:42.320> these<00:03:42.440> clips<00:03:42.710> are

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
a difference so all these clips are

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.040 
a difference so all these clips are
synced<00:03:43.070> them<00:03:43.160> nicely<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.450> camera<00:03:44.810> angle

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
synced them nicely but this camera angle

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.220 
synced them nicely but this camera angle
was<00:03:45.200> done<00:03:45.410> very<00:03:46.070> poorly<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.880> start<00:03:47.480> fading<00:03:47.990> off

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
was done very poorly I start fading off

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.750 
was done very poorly I start fading off
to<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> little<00:03:48.800> bit<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.460> then<00:03:49.550> I<00:03:49.580> hit

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
to the right a little bit and then I hit

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.150 
to the right a little bit and then I hit
the<00:03:49.850> wall<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.960> was<00:03:51.110> bad<00:03:51.320> but<00:03:51.620> right<00:03:51.920> here<00:03:52.100> I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the wall that was bad but right here I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.830 
the wall that was bad but right here I
actually<00:03:52.370> like<00:03:52.760> because<00:03:53.030> every<00:03:53.300> right<00:03:53.540> step

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
actually like because every right step

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.590 
actually like because every right step
that<00:03:54.050> he<00:03:54.140> takes<00:03:54.410> there's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> boom<00:03:55.520> I<00:03:55.850> actually

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
that he takes there's a boom I actually

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.450 
that he takes there's a boom I actually
didn't<00:03:56.990> mean<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.170> plan<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.710> but<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.280> worked

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
didn't mean to plan that but it worked

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.340 
didn't mean to plan that but it worked
out<00:03:58.640> some<00:03:59.390> times<00:03:59.600> throughout<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.900> machinima

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
out some times throughout this machinima

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.440 
out some times throughout this machinima
you'll<00:04:00.560> also<00:04:00.710> notice<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.190> we're<00:04:01.910> jogging

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
you'll also notice that we're jogging

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.390 
you'll also notice that we're jogging
and<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:03.050> just<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.320> fact<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.650> black<00:04:04.160> ops

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
and it's just the fact that black ops

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.670 
and it's just the fact that black ops
released<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.840> little<00:04:06.050> bit<00:04:06.170> before<00:04:06.320> i<00:04:06.530> made

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
released just a little bit before i made

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.650 
released just a little bit before i made
this<00:04:06.800> machinima<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.580> we<00:04:08.120> didn't<00:04:08.330> have<00:04:08.390> all<00:04:08.570> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
this machinima so we didn't have all the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.300 
this machinima so we didn't have all the
challenges<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> marathon<00:04:09.770> pro<00:04:10.040> yet

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
challenges to get the marathon pro yet

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.130 
challenges to get the marathon pro yet
so<00:04:10.670> we<00:04:11.240> have<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.390> do<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.510> couple<00:04:11.690> takes<00:04:11.960> for<00:04:12.110> that

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
so we have to do a couple takes for that

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.910 
so we have to do a couple takes for that
i<00:04:12.350> really<00:04:12.710> like<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:12.890> angle<00:04:13.340> right<00:04:13.460> there

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
i really like that angle right there

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.120 
i really like that angle right there
and<00:04:14.790> here<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.660> dive<00:04:15.990> but<00:04:16.470> where<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
and here is the dive but where the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.759 
and here is the dive but where the
chorus<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.760> song<00:04:17.820> kicks<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.690> which<00:04:19.560> is

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
chorus of the song kicks in which is

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.069 
chorus of the song kicks in which is
just<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.459> epic<00:04:20.880> which<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.329> why<00:04:21.450> made<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
just so epic which is why made that the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.500 
just so epic which is why made that the
epic<00:04:22.320> dolphin<00:04:22.680> dive<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.850> would<00:04:24.000> not<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.300> nearly

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
epic dolphin dive it would not be nearly

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.480 
epic dolphin dive it would not be nearly
as<00:04:24.660> epic<00:04:24.990> without<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.320> song<00:04:25.530> his<00:04:26.040> face<00:04:26.280> goes

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
as epic without the song his face goes

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.409 
as epic without the song his face goes
through<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.730> camera<00:04:27.000> there<00:04:27.150> which<00:04:27.330> was

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
through the camera there which was

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.300 
through the camera there which was
unfortunate<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.290> really<00:04:28.889> should<00:04:29.040> have<00:04:29.100> changed

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
unfortunate I really should have changed

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.650 
unfortunate I really should have changed
that<00:04:29.430> angle<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.150> guess<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.510> was<00:04:30.630> just

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
that angle but I guess I was just

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.620 
that angle but I guess I was just
getting<00:04:31.020> impatient<00:04:31.560> now<00:04:31.970> well<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.450> bit

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
getting impatient now well a little bit

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.930 
getting impatient now well a little bit
of<00:04:33.750> money<00:04:34.080> part<00:04:34.410> about<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:35.370> second<00:04:35.700> guy

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
of money part about the second guy

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.180 
of money part about the second guy
diving<00:04:36.630> off<00:04:36.780> was<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.770> private

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
diving off was that in this private

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.530 
diving off was that in this private
match<00:04:38.340> we<00:04:38.550> were<00:04:38.639> actually<00:04:38.760> weren't<00:04:39.090> planning

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
match we were actually weren't planning

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.290

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
on it we we were just gonna have the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.030 
on it we we were just gonna have the
first<00:04:42.540> guy<00:04:42.750> jump<00:04:43.050> off<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.530> then<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> second

first guy jump off and then the second

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.470 
first guy jump off and then the second
guy<00:04:44.130> would<00:04:44.310> stop<00:04:44.580> you'd<00:04:44.820> realize<00:04:45.120> he<00:04:45.240> didn't

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
guy would stop you'd realize he didn't

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.150 
guy would stop you'd realize he didn't
want<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.780> jump<00:04:46.200> off<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:46.889> you<00:04:46.979> turn

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
want to jump off and then you turn

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.190 
want to jump off and then you turn
around<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.430> walk<00:04:47.550> away<00:04:47.610> but<00:04:48.540> my<00:04:48.690> friend<00:04:48.990> just

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
around and walk away but my friend just

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.629 
around and walk away but my friend just
like<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.500> was<00:04:49.830> just<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.100> right<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.430> think

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
like I was just like right I think

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.920 
like I was just like right I think

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.210 
that's about it he was like okay and
then<00:04:52.050> he<00:04:52.139> just<00:04:52.169> jumps<00:04:52.590> off<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.740> edge<00:04:52.950> anyway

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
then he just jumps off the edge anyway

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.610 
then he just jumps off the edge anyway
and<00:04:53.580> then<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.510> was<00:04:54.720> kind<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:55.020> pissed<00:04:55.169> off<00:04:55.350> by<00:04:55.560> the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
and then I was kind of pissed off by the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.710 
and then I was kind of pissed off by the
fact<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.100> campaign<00:04:56.520> mission<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.479> have

fact in that campaign mission you have

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.950 
fact in that campaign mission you have
two<00:04:58.080> guys<00:04:58.320> free<00:04:58.740> falling<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.780> there<00:05:00.780> was<00:05:00.870> only

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
two guys free falling and there was only

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.170 
two guys free falling and there was only
one<00:05:01.229> diver<00:05:01.470> obviously<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.160> was<00:05:02.250> like<00:05:02.370> wait

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
one diver obviously and I was like wait

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.250 
one diver obviously and I was like wait
a<00:05:03.240> second<00:05:03.600> this<00:05:03.660> could<00:05:03.720> actually<00:05:04.020> work

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
a second this could actually work

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.650 
a second this could actually work
perfectly<00:05:05.100> fill<00:05:05.460> up<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.669> time<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.270> it'll

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
perfectly fill up the time and it'll

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.120 
perfectly fill up the time and it'll
look<00:05:06.840> gray<00:05:07.139> in<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.410> freefall<00:05:07.860> with<00:05:08.010> two

people<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:09.030> that's<00:05:09.389> basically<00:05:09.600> how<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.500> came

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
people so that's basically how that came

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.540 
people so that's basically how that came
to<00:05:10.860> be<00:05:10.889> because<00:05:12.650> yeah<00:05:13.650> that's<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:14.190> just

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
there's a third person which I really

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.060 
there's a third person which I really
wish<00:05:20.729> didn't<00:05:21.300> come<00:05:21.419> into<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.720> freeze<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
wish didn't come into the freeze the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.909 
wish didn't come into the freeze the
camera<00:05:23.430> frame<00:05:23.960> but<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.229> mean<00:05:25.620> there's<00:05:25.800> nothing

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
camera frame but I mean there's nothing

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.770 
camera frame but I mean there's nothing
you<00:05:26.130> can<00:05:26.280> do<00:05:26.400> about<00:05:26.490> that<00:05:26.640> the<00:05:26.940> dive<00:05:27.150> worked

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
you can do about that the dive worked

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.900 
you can do about that the dive worked
perfectly<00:05:28.320> for<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.680> scenario<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> snow<00:05:29.669> map

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
perfectly for the scenario is a snow map

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.529 
perfectly for the scenario is a snow map
and<00:05:30.210> then<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.020> go<00:05:31.410> black<00:05:32.180> also<00:05:33.180> another<00:05:33.390> thing

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
and then I go black also another thing

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.090 
and then I go black also another thing
you'll<00:05:33.810> notice<00:05:33.960> about<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.410> free<00:05:34.650> fall<00:05:34.890> I

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
you'll notice about that free fall I

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.950 
you'll notice about that free fall I
used<00:05:35.520> some<00:05:35.729> shaky<00:05:35.970> cam<00:05:36.240> effect<00:05:36.570> just<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.840> make

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
used some shaky cam effect just to make

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.330 
used some shaky cam effect just to make
it<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.260> much<00:05:37.289> more<00:05:37.470> intense<00:05:37.919> instead<00:05:38.250> of

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
it that much more intense instead of

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.360 
it that much more intense instead of
just<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:39.229> solid<00:05:40.229> frame<00:05:40.530> moving<00:05:40.950> downward

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
just that solid frame moving downward

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.909 
just that solid frame moving downward
but<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:42.090> needed<00:05:42.900> a<00:05:42.960> good<00:05:43.169> way<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.350> end<00:05:43.440> this<00:05:43.710> off

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
but I needed a good way to end this off

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.800 
but I needed a good way to end this off
so<00:05:44.190> i<00:05:44.220> figured<00:05:44.640> kind<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.270> do<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.390> little<00:05:45.600> bit<00:05:45.780> of

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
so i figured kind of do a little bit of

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.990 
so i figured kind of do a little bit of
a<00:05:45.930> repeat<00:05:46.380> thing<00:05:46.620> kind<00:05:47.190> of<00:05:47.280> ties<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.729> with<00:05:47.820> the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
a repeat thing kind of ties in with the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.950 
a repeat thing kind of ties in with the
