00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.660 
another after effects tutorial for you
guys<00:00:13.450> so<00:00:14.139> what<00:00:14.590> we're<00:00:14.710> gonna<00:00:14.830> learn<00:00:15.010> today<00:00:15.250> is

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.660 
guys so what we're gonna learn today is
using<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.299> plugin<00:00:16.810> trapcode<00:00:17.140> 3d<00:00:17.770> stroke<00:00:18.070> to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
using the plugin trapcode 3d stroke to

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.660 
using the plugin trapcode 3d stroke to
make<00:00:18.850> stroke<00:00:19.240> square<00:00:19.600> around<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.869> circle<00:00:20.320> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
make stroke square around the circle and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.450 
make stroke square around the circle and
yeah<00:00:21.670> so<00:00:22.359> this<00:00:22.930> effect<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.650> is<00:00:23.830> a<00:00:23.859> lot<00:00:24.130> in

you're done with that let's do a new
layer<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.659> shape<00:01:13.930> layer<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.829> this<00:01:15.280> is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
layer and the shape layer and this is

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.090 
layer and the shape layer and this is
gonna<00:01:15.520> be<00:01:15.729> our<00:01:15.759> circle<00:01:16.359> so<00:01:16.810> I'm<00:01:17.020> gonna<00:01:17.229> rename

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
gonna be our circle so I'm gonna rename

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.139 
gonna be our circle so I'm gonna rename
this<00:01:18.479> circle<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.159> gonna<00:01:21.340> pop<00:01:21.880> my

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
this circle and I'm just gonna pop my

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.080 
this circle and I'm just gonna pop my
grid<00:01:22.539> up<00:01:22.719> right<00:01:22.960> here<00:01:23.109> and<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.340> circle<00:01:24.850> our

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
grid up right here and in the circle our

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.929 
grid up right here and in the circle our
ellipse<00:01:25.630> tool<00:01:25.929> we're<00:01:26.590> just<00:01:26.799> gonna<00:01:26.950> do<00:01:27.219> a<00:01:27.460> quick

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
ellipse tool we're just gonna do a quick

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.940 
ellipse tool we're just gonna do a quick
circle<00:01:30.719> doesn't<00:01:31.719> have<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.200> be<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.649> accurate

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
circle doesn't have to be that accurate

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.120 
circle doesn't have to be that accurate
but<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:33.670> yep<00:01:34.119> so<00:01:34.509> here<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:35.920> we're

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
going to do the stroke layer so going to

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.789 
going to do the stroke layer so going to
layer<00:01:44.020> new<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.189> adjustment<00:01:46.090> layer

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
layer new and adjustment layer

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
layer new and adjustment layer
and<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.400> before<00:01:47.670> doing<00:01:47.850> anything<00:01:48.270> let's

and now before doing anything let's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.730 
and now before doing anything let's
rename<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.369> stroke<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.259> now<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.560> we're

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
rename this stroke and now that we're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
rename this stroke and now that we're
selected<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.850> layer<00:01:54.119> we're<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.630> go

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
selected on this layer we're gonna go

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.100 
selected on this layer we're gonna go
into<00:01:54.990> effect<00:01:55.619> track<00:01:56.399> CO<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> 3d<00:01:57.540> stroke

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
into effect track CO and 3d stroke

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
into effect track CO and 3d stroke
now<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.610> can't<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.119> circle

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
now you then you can't see your circle

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.029 
now you then you can't see your circle
anymore<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.110> worry<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
anymore don't worry just going to

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.910 
anymore don't worry just going to
transfer<00:02:02.549> mode<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.600> nun<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.560> normal

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
transfer mode and go to nun to normal

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.600 
transfer mode and go to nun to normal
and<00:02:05.070> boom<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.240> again<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.369> then

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and boom there it is again so now then

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820 
and boom there it is again so now then
we<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.880> done<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.539> we're<00:02:09.989> gonna<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.470> and

we have done that we're gonna go and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.000 
we have done that we're gonna go and
make<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.459> new<00:02:11.959> circle<00:02:12.959> around<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.560> first<00:02:13.800> one

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
make a new circle around the first one

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.720 
make a new circle around the first one
so<00:02:14.640> grab<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.060> ellipse<00:02:15.690> tool<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.980> by

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so grab your ellipse tool and just by

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.360 
so grab your ellipse tool and just by
pressing<00:02:18.180> shift<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.840> drag<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> out<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.980> make

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
pressing shift just drag it out and make

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.759 
pressing shift just drag it out and make
it<00:02:20.400> go<00:02:20.730> almost<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.019> stroke<00:02:22.350> all

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
it go almost like if it's a stroke all

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.220 
it go almost like if it's a stroke all
of<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.130> circle<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.049> just

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
of your circle so here it is I'm just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.440 
of your circle so here it is I'm just
gonna<00:02:25.410> move<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.860> bit<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:27.120> make<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.450> look<00:02:27.600> good

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
gonna move it a bit to make it look good

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.490 
gonna move it a bit to make it look good
yeah<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> looks<00:02:30.810> about<00:02:30.930> right

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
yeah that looks about right

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
yeah that looks about right
so<00:02:31.890> now<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.640> done<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.209> we're

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
so now that we have done that we're

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.770 
so now that we have done that we're
gonna<00:02:33.750> go<00:02:34.049> into<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.730> thickness<00:02:36.299> tab<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
gonna go into the thickness tab and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.470 
gonna go into the thickness tab and
bring<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> bit<00:02:37.530> down<00:02:38.100> because<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.880> think

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
bring it a bit down because I think

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.820 
bring it a bit down because I think
that's<00:02:39.780> what<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.500> think

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's what you think

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
um and now that we have done that we can

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.380 
um and now that we have done that we can
choose<00:02:43.860> our<00:02:43.920> color<00:02:44.280> I'm<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.970> gonna<00:02:45.150> leave<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
choose our color I'm just gonna leave it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.020 
choose our color I'm just gonna leave it
white<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.580> start

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
white and now we can just start

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.940 
white and now we can just start
animating<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.900> putting<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> settings

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
animating and putting all the settings

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.240 
animating and putting all the settings
in<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.730> going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.239> use<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.989> paths<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> untick

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
in so going to use all paths and untick

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
in so going to use all paths and untick
this<00:02:53.430> don't<00:02:54.030> worry<00:02:54.209> if<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.390> can't<00:02:54.600> see

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
anymore because now we're gonna go into

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.319 
anymore because now we're gonna go into
path<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.060> select<00:02:57.660> mask<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.850> also<00:02:59.850> guys<00:03:00.060> if

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
path and select mask one also guys if

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.259 
path and select mask one also guys if
you<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.320> semicircle<00:03:01.910> with<00:03:02.910> white

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
black and white don't take that and you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.640 
black and white don't take that and you
feel<00:03:05.489> them<00:03:05.850> especially<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.470> take

now that we have done that we're gonna

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.789 
now that we have done that we're gonna
go<00:03:16.709> into<00:03:17.370> our<00:03:17.700> settings<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.230> start<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
go into our settings for the start and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.660 
go into our settings for the start and
ends<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.459> what<00:03:20.880> we're<00:03:21.030> gonna<00:03:21.120> do<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:22.670> putting

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
ends so what we're gonna do is putting

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
ends so what we're gonna do is putting
the<00:03:23.880> start<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.540> leaving<00:03:25.109> it<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.380> zero<00:03:25.680> but

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the start and leaving it at zero but

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.910 
the start and leaving it at zero but
bringing<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.239> end<00:03:27.480> down<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.769> 70<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:31.109> now<00:03:31.680> what

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
bringing the end down to 70 and now what

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.699 
bringing the end down to 70 and now what
we're<00:03:32.040> gonna<00:03:32.100> do<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.670> put<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.810> offset<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
we're gonna do is put the offset to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.479 
we're gonna do is put the offset to
negative<00:03:35.250> 100<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.910> now<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:38.220> basically

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
negative 100 and now it's basically

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.599 
negative 100 and now it's basically
ready<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.359> get<00:03:39.540> animated<00:03:40.019> um<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.190> now<00:03:41.370> what

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
ready to get animated um so now what

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.420 
ready to get animated um so now what
we're<00:03:41.730> gonna<00:03:41.880> do<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.359> just<00:03:42.920> keep<00:03:43.920> from<00:03:44.130> this

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
we're gonna do is just keep from this

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.580 
we're gonna do is just keep from this
and<00:03:44.790> body<00:03:45.030> clicking<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> stopwatch<00:03:46.079> and

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.730 

just<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.720> now<00:04:33.750> you're<00:04:34.170> saying<00:04:34.380> wow

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
this not really that smooth how can we

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.650 
this not really that smooth how can we
make<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.830> look<00:04:37.950> much<00:04:38.190> sweeter<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.120> people

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
make it look much sweeter so people

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.390 
make it look much sweeter so people
think<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.170> use<00:04:40.320> feather<00:04:40.650> but<00:04:40.920> don't

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
think that you use feather but don't

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.210 
think that you use feather but don't
even<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.640> about<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.720> going<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.140> down<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
even think about that going to down the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.970 
even think about that going to down the
taper<00:04:44.490> bring<00:04:45.330> all<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.720> settings<00:04:46.080> down<00:04:46.290> now

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
taper bring all the settings down now

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.010 
taper bring all the settings down now
what<00:04:47.400> what<00:04:47.940> this<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.240> gonna<00:04:48.390> do<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.840> basically

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
what what this is gonna do is basically

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.380 
what what this is gonna do is basically
make<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:50.040> line<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.490> seem<00:04:50.760> like<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.180> it's

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
make the line and seem like if it's

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.830 
make the line and seem like if it's
growing<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.250> do<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:53.820> just<00:04:54.300> going<00:04:54.660> in

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
growing out so to do this just going in

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.540 
growing out so to do this just going in
to<00:04:56.900> enable<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.140> take<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.040> now<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.310> can

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
to enable and take that and now you can

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.200 
to enable and take that and now you can
see<00:04:59.760> that<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.120> already<00:05:00.300> starting<00:05:00.510> to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
see that it's already starting to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.110 
see that it's already starting to
basically<00:05:03.210> grow<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:04.520> my<00:05:05.520> settings<00:05:05.910> are

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
basically grow and my settings are

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.450 
basically grow and my settings are
actually<00:05:06.540> already<00:05:06.900> good<00:05:07.200> because<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.160> start

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
actually already good because the start

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.110 
actually already good because the start
is<00:05:08.669> 50<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.660> taper<00:05:09.900> end<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.410> 50<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:11.820> if

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
is 50 and the taper end is 50 so now if

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.909 
is 50 and the taper end is 50 so now if
