00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.569 
know let me down let me know what you
think<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.329> first<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:52.189> it's<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
think of this game first off it's one of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
think of this game first off it's one of
my<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.360> mediocre<00:01:54.720> games<00:01:55.140> throughout<00:01:55.619> from

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
my more mediocre games throughout from

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
my more mediocre games throughout from
the<00:01:55.950> tournament<00:01:56.130> gameplay<00:01:56.549> i<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the tournament gameplay i have but and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
the tournament gameplay i have but and
it's<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:58.950> slow<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.820> now<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.240> mean

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's a little slow like right now I mean

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.920 
it's a little slow like right now I mean
it's<00:02:00.630> 40<00:02:00.990> 40<00:02:01.350> m<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.490> turns<00:02:02.670> into

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
it's 40 40 m so it kind of turns into

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's 40 40 m so it kind of turns into
TDM<00:02:03.930> competitive<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.799> turns<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
TDM competitive kind of turns it to a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.089 
TDM competitive kind of turns it to a
camp<00:02:05.520> fest<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.560> believe<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> game

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
camp fest I think I believe this game

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.809 
camp fest I think I believe this game
did<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:09.709> don't<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.890> playing<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.520> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
did I don't like playing like that so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.820 
did I don't like playing like that so
I'm<00:02:12.120> extremely<00:02:12.750> aggressive<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.470> if<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'm extremely aggressive and if that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.420 
I'm extremely aggressive and if that
up<00:02:14.010> getting<00:02:14.400> us<00:02:14.660> out<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.110> lead<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.280> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
up getting us out of the lead so be it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.830 
up getting us out of the lead so be it
but<00:02:17.640> uh<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.600> don't<00:02:19.170> know<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:20.030> really<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.570> like

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
but uh I don't know I really do like

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840 
but uh I don't know I really do like
playing<00:02:22.200> TDM<00:02:22.560> competitively<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.550> did<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
playing TDM competitively we did it a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.420 
playing TDM competitively we did it a
lot<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.120> mom<00:02:24.240> for<00:02:24.510> two<00:02:24.690> that's<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.920> played<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
lot of mom for two that's I played a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.900 
lot of mom for two that's I played a
different<00:02:26.790> group<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> guys<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.220> yeah<00:02:29.220> we

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
different group of guys then but yeah we

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.570 
different group of guys then but yeah we
we<00:02:30.690> don't<00:02:30.810> play<00:02:31.050> campy<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:32.310> think<00:02:32.490> that's

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
we don't play campy I just think that's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.090 
we don't play campy I just think that's
cheap<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.150> mean<00:02:33.630> well<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.800> legitimate

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
cheap I mean well it's a legitimate

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.500 
cheap I mean well it's a legitimate
strategy<00:02:35.370> yes<00:02:36.330> i'm<00:02:36.720> quoting<00:02:37.310> red<00:02:38.310> vs<00:02:38.610> blue<00:02:38.640> but

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
strategy yes i'm quoting red vs blue but

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.030 
strategy yes i'm quoting red vs blue but
uh<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.120> legit<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
uh I I really think it's it's legit and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.610 
uh I I really think it's it's legit and
it's<00:02:44.040> annoying<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.930> don't<00:02:46.020> deny<00:02:46.470> that

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's annoying I don't I don't deny that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.400 
it's annoying I don't I don't deny that
but<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.790> what<00:02:48.210> happened<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> mean<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.730 
but it's what happened so I mean if you
get<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> lead<00:02:49.830> get<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> win<00:02:50.880> camp<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> up

I hope it comes out by Friday so that
everybody<00:05:42.810> can<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:43.139> it<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.909> doubt<00:05:45.029> it

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
everybody can have it but I doubt it

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.779 
everybody can have it but I doubt it
will<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:46.800> already<00:05:47.039> out<00:05:47.069> for<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.370> ps3<00:05:47.580> I

will it's already out for the ps3 I

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.070 
will it's already out for the ps3 I
believe<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.240> was<00:05:48.389> checking<00:05:48.569> some<00:05:48.839> Twitter

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
believe I was checking some Twitter

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.619 
believe I was checking some Twitter
updates<00:05:49.439> but<00:05:50.219> there's<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.729> patch<00:05:50.909> one<00:05:51.330> point<00:05:51.539> of

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
updates but there's a patch one point of

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:54.619 
updates but there's a patch one point of
six<00:05:51.930> for<00:05:52.379> the<00:05:52.409> xbox<00:05:52.710> 360<00:05:53.129> which<00:05:54.000> will<00:05:54.479> be

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
six for the xbox 360 which will be

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.800 
six for the xbox 360 which will be
coming<00:05:54.810> out<00:05:55.759> sometime<00:05:56.759> next<00:05:57.120> week<00:05:57.419> I<00:05:57.539> believe

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
coming out sometime next week I believe

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.749 
coming out sometime next week I believe
because<00:05:58.020> it's<00:05:58.649> not<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:58.979> week<00:05:59.129> but<00:05:59.159> should<00:05:59.699> be

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
because it's not this week but should be

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.740 
because it's not this week but should be
up<00:05:59.879> next<00:06:00.029> week<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.560> it<00:06:01.560> actually<00:06:01.770> allows<00:06:02.009> for

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
up next week and it actually allows for

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.709 
up next week and it actually allows for
legitimate<00:06:03.750> like<00:06:03.930> land<00:06:05.000> not<00:06:06.000> land<00:06:06.330> lobbies

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
legitimate like land not land lobbies

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.809 
legitimate like land not land lobbies
which<00:06:07.020> is<00:06:07.139> disappointing<00:06:07.349> but<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:08.370> allows<00:06:08.699> you

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
which is disappointing but it allows you

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.600 
which is disappointing but it allows you
to<00:06:08.909> add<00:06:09.029> a<00:06:09.060> 60<00:06:09.479> second<00:06:09.750> time<00:06:09.899> or<00:06:10.080> match<00:06:10.830> begin

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
to add a 60 second time or match begin

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.399 
to add a 60 second time or match begin
timer<00:06:12.089> or<00:06:12.360> something<00:06:12.689> to<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.960> beginning<00:06:13.229> of

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
timer or something to the beginning of

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.409 
timer or something to the beginning of
match<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.430> that<00:06:14.580> you're<00:06:14.669> sitting<00:06:14.849> there<00:06:15.060> for<00:06:15.210> a

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
match so that you're sitting there for a

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.029 
match so that you're sitting there for a
whole<00:06:15.659> minute<00:06:15.870> while<00:06:16.529> the<00:06:16.710> people<00:06:16.860> are

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
whole minute while the people are

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.439 
whole minute while the people are
joining<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.669> match<00:06:17.819> that<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.240> created

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
joining the match that you just created

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.070 
joining the match that you just created
so<00:06:19.139> it's<00:06:19.800> beneficial<00:06:20.189> and<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.729> actually<00:06:21.080> helps

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
so it's beneficial and it actually helps

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.740 
so it's beneficial and it actually helps
create<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.860> land<00:06:23.189> setting<00:06:23.610> but<00:06:24.300> it's<00:06:24.509> still

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
create a land setting but it's still

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.820 
create a land setting but it's still
more<00:06:25.349> aggravating<00:06:25.800> than<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:27.379> then<00:06:28.379> a<00:06:28.409> regular

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
more aggravating than a then a regular

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.640 
more aggravating than a then a regular
land<00:06:29.189> lobby<00:06:29.430> would<00:06:29.669> be<00:06:29.819> like<00:06:30.180> in<00:06:30.419> say

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
land lobby would be like in say

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.450 
land lobby would be like in say
hallo<00:06:32.300> so<00:06:33.620> yeah<00:06:34.620> that's<00:06:34.860> an<00:06:35.009> aggravating

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
hallo so yeah that's an aggravating

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.650 
hallo so yeah that's an aggravating

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
point and I probably end up bringing it

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.300
