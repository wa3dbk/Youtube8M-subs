something<00:01:10.140> some<00:01:10.920> evil<00:01:11.220> purpose

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.240 

she<00:01:20.110> doesn't<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.530> pick<00:01:20.710> up<00:01:20.860> all<00:01:21.070> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
she doesn't have to pick up all the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
she doesn't have to pick up all the
weapons<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.940> put<00:01:22.510> him<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.750> bench<00:01:23.020> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
weapons and put him to the bench and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.890 
weapons and put him to the bench and
luckily<00:01:24.490> he<00:01:24.790> has<00:01:24.970> duct<00:01:25.270> tape<00:01:25.450> with<00:01:25.630> him<00:01:25.720> at<00:01:25.810> all

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
luckily he has duct tape with him at all

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.899 
luckily he has duct tape with him at all
times<00:01:25.960> he<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:26.470> stitch<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.610> two<00:01:27.760> together

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
times he just stitch the two together

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.580 
times he just stitch the two together
automatically<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.080> guess<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.470> where

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
automatically so I guess this is where

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.810 
automatically so I guess this is where
things<00:01:32.770> get<00:01:33.010> pretty<00:01:33.880> violent<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.540> hurry<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
things get pretty violent in a hurry you

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.859 
things get pretty violent in a hurry you
don't<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> worry<00:01:37.270> about<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.479> killing

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
don't have to worry about just killing

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.630 
don't have to worry about just killing
one<00:01:37.930> zombie<00:01:38.590> at<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.680> time<00:01:38.860> anymore<00:01:41.460> yeah<00:01:42.460> this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
one zombie at a time anymore yeah this

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.859 
one zombie at a time anymore yeah this
is<00:01:42.759> pretty<00:01:43.509> gross<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.630> main

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
is pretty gross so this this is the main

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.560 
is pretty gross so this this is the main
mode<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.560> game<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.820> like<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.119> original

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
mode of the game and like the original

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.389 
mode of the game and like the original
there's<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.170> time<00:01:50.619> limit<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:50.979> there's<00:01:51.310> a

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
there's a time limit so there's a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.070 
there's a time limit so there's a
survivor<00:01:51.700> who<00:01:51.910> needs<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.390> be<00:01:52.420> saved<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.990> you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
survivor who needs to be saved and you

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.050 
survivor who needs to be saved and you
have<00:01:53.200> 10<00:01:53.979> minutes<00:01:54.160> of<00:01:54.340> real<00:01:54.460> time<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.880> save

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
have 10 minutes of real time to save

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.389 
have 10 minutes of real time to save
them<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.570> don't<00:01:55.780> they<00:01:56.050> get<00:01:56.289> killed<00:01:56.560> so

them and if you don't they get killed so
it's<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.580> similar<00:01:57.880> structure<00:01:58.210> where<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.539> have

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
it's a similar structure where you have

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.300 
it's a similar structure where you have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
dead rising you can stick around and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.499 
dead rising you can stick around and
just<00:02:05.200> grind<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.130> level<00:02:06.399> up<00:02:06.550> or<00:02:06.789> earn<00:02:06.910> money<00:02:07.210> and

you're killing all the zombies so it's a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.540 
you're killing all the zombies so it's a
very<00:02:14.140> similar<00:02:14.560> progression<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> first

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550

can you shocked them with already on the
ground<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.730> make<00:03:00.820> them<00:03:00.970> convulse<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.450> little

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.980 

Wow<00:03:11.420> lucky<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.840> bite<00:03:13.080> doesn't<00:03:13.230> turn<00:03:13.500> Oh<00:03:13.620> God

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so you can just destroy them and there's

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.390 
so you can just destroy them and there's
little<00:03:17.400> tiny<00:03:17.610> zombie<00:03:18.030> pieces<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> guess<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
little tiny zombie pieces so I guess the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.710 
little tiny zombie pieces so I guess the
the<00:03:20.640> big<00:03:20.820> difference<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.210> this<00:03:21.360> takes<00:03:21.570> place

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the big difference is this takes place
