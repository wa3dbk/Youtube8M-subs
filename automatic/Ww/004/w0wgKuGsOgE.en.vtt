00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.430
 you will finish here your complement with casey 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.259
 highlights we are very excited the day 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.400
 today because we're going to take the time 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.610
 from a black mate to a 2003 vokswagen 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.669
 happen as you see here we already have everything 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.439
 prepared is clean is dry ready 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.980
 to express it, we are going to create it with a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.250
 golden star hdl 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.860
 we already dilute the product we are going to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.440
 start to miss the remain 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 selected for them to see by step 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.160
 step from the first of the first layer 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.590
 up to the fourth layer 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.040
 remember that 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.110
 it is not necessary to cover all the windows 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 because back you can take off from there 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 we did it to preserve a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.489
 little the product so we do not have to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.070
 miss it and remove it after it is spent 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.010
 a little less if then if I cover it with a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.260
 I read with a paper 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.050
 that the coach that we are going to 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
 do ok comrades here we already started to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.570
 crash the first layer remember that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 it's 50 or 60 percent transparent 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.280
 remember that being a little 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.630
 caution take precautions here we go 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 to put on our mask and I 'm going to 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.330
 show how to throw the first layer we go 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330
 to start 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.310
 ok comrades this or something that I'm going to 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.310
 recommend when they are painting their 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.530
 cars touch your vehicle whatever 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:49.820
 first they begin to paint their capacete and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.120
 then they can paint their trunk after 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.470
 to follow with the sides to the last 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.300
 I recommend that you make your chest to the reason 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 why we recommend that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.620
 because it is the most important part of a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 vehicle when you are driving the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.460
 people are the first to see what you see 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.670
 is the chest the front truth then 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.220
 so that it does not fall on you anymore 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.530
 I finish with everything else and already the last 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.660
 what's left is the chest so it stays for 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670
 the last one already there are particles left in the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.400
 air no longer stay do not fall on the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.750
 chest because the rest is already painted 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 that is my recommendation is what 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.280
 we recommend you here in casey 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.730
 of pge or something something important then 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.480
 Take it into account when you are waiting 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.069
 and they have the first layer of plastic 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.180
 remember we are not going to let it 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.459
 Dry about 15 minutes 15 to 20 minutes and 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.099
 we start with the second layer ok 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.150
 comrades here was the first layer of 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.939
 pib 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.519
 remember that it is 50 or 60 percent 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.709
 transparent the car is black so it's 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.129
 that you do not notice that much but if you notice 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.290
 here you still see a lot of the chrome in 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.150
 the first the second and the third layer 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.890
 we're going to throw it like it's the most 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.500
 little product to make a good base 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.230
 for the two of us the other layers 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.840
 that carry more products there are in parts 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.910
 that if you see a little 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
 of the original painting but there's no 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.209
 problem remember that in the first the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.430
 second and the third layer is where it goes 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.110
 to cover that in the last layers is 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 where will you let go one more product 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.769
 you want to improve I do not have anything left 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.470
 that here we are starting with the fourth 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.680
 layer remember that the first the second 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 and the third layer were the most 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.849
 products to make a base so that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.160
 grip on the last layers remember 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.610
 that the last layers have to be more 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 thick 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.080
 let's do 5 at best 6 but now 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.820
 when we finish the video we tell them 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.600
 exactly how many layers 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.060
 we did remember to clear it enough 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.910
 product 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.370
 not for them to run but enough 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.300
 so it's pretty wet here 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.610
 let's teach how to do it 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.210
 ok comrades this is a very point 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.980
 important that I want to tell you I want 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.550
 apologize for not having it 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.320
 filmed this between the fourth and the fifth 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.630
 cap 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.290
 we change him 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.790
 the way to miss the gun of a 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.410
 fan to a downtown shot and the reason 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.060
 why we did that is to grab 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:38.710
 well around the one on the cover of the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.990
 gas this where where the doors are and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.610
 all of that is to make sure that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.510
 they will hold well there in these curvitas 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.690
 where many times it does not hold well 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.860
 coverage when they have it in a fan 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.740

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.210
