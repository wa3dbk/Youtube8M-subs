00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
and then turbo motor and it's not tuned

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.350 
and then turbo motor and it's not tuned
in<00:01:10.240> yet<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:11.440> don't<00:01:11.590> have<00:01:11.860> an<00:01:11.950> air<00:01:12.100> fuel

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
in yet and I don't have an air fuel

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.660 
in yet and I don't have an air fuel
gauge<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:13.630> there<00:01:13.840> really<00:01:14.110> tuned<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.670> feels

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
gauge on there really tuned it feels

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.700 
gauge on there really tuned it feels
like<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:16.000> got<00:01:16.120> a<00:01:16.150> lot<00:01:16.300> of<00:01:16.360> power<00:01:16.630> but<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.410> can't

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
like it's got a lot of power but I can't

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.280 
like it's got a lot of power but I can't
really<00:01:17.980> open<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.400> up<00:01:18.550> on<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.780> street

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
really open it up on the street

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.900 
really open it up on the street
because<00:01:20.620> I'll<00:01:20.740> never<00:01:21.010> exceed<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.610> speed

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
because I'll never exceed the speed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.600 
because I'll never exceed the speed
limit<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.920> doesn't<00:01:24.160> have<00:01:24.280> an<00:01:24.340> alignment

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
limit and it doesn't have an alignment

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.520 
limit and it doesn't have an alignment
so<00:01:24.910> it's<00:01:25.030> kind<00:01:25.180> of<00:01:25.240> squirrely<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
so it's kind of squirrely but that's the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.980 
so it's kind of squirrely but that's the
deal<00:01:29.740> right<00:01:30.070> there<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.270> hopefully<00:01:31.630> we'll<00:01:31.780> take

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
deal right there so hopefully we'll take

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.960 
deal right there so hopefully we'll take
off<00:01:32.170> later<00:01:32.440> today<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.340> get<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.670> Bonneville

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
off later today to get up to Bonneville

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.730
