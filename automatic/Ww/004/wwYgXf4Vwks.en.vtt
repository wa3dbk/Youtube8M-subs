00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
things this is what I found out

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
things this is what I found out
I<00:02:54.230> discovered<00:02:55.040> there's<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.580> movement<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
I discovered there's a movement for a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.199 
I discovered there's a movement for a
better<00:02:56.540> way<00:02:56.780> now<00:02:57.100> while<00:02:58.100> back<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.580> wanted<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> be

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
an in a full football player I decided

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880 
an in a full football player I decided
that<00:03:02.120> I'd<00:03:02.360> rather<00:03:02.570> be<00:03:02.750> an<00:03:02.959> organic<00:03:03.500> farmer

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890

these things I've been learning about
the<00:03:53.780> food<00:03:53.989> system<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.889> seems<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.370> me<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.519> we

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
the food system it seems to me that we

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.580 
the food system it seems to me that we
can<00:03:55.940> either<00:03:56.000> pay<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.269> farmer<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:57.139> we<00:03:57.319> can<00:03:57.470> pay

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
can either pay the farmer or we can pay

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:06.350 
can either pay the farmer or we can pay
the<00:03:57.650> hospital<00:03:57.889> I<00:03:58.569> know
