00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
piece of ice ball stick so this one is

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.740 
piece of ice ball stick so this one is
let<00:00:17.970> me<00:00:18.090> see<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.800> five<00:00:19.800> centimeters<00:00:20.430> long

let me see it's five centimeters long

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.450 
let me see it's five centimeters long
that<00:00:21.750> way<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.189> nice

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
politics so five centimeters and then

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.480 
politics so five centimeters and then
we're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.740> these<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.340> bits

next okay now that you cut this little

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
next okay now that you cut this little
piece<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.520> should<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
piece out that's what should look like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
piece out that's what should look like
that<00:01:30.479> doesn't<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.320> too<00:01:31.530> big<00:01:31.740> that's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that doesn't have to be too big that's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.330 
that doesn't have to be too big that's
that<00:01:32.939> little<00:01:33.090> piece<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.979> only

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that little piece there is like only

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.840 
that little piece there is like only
three<00:01:35.460> mil<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:38.130> needs<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.460> enough<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
three mil it just needs to be enough so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.130 
three mil it just needs to be enough so
I'll<00:01:38.909> could<00:01:39.060> fit<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I'll could fit into that like that so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.270 
I'll could fit into that like that so
you<00:01:43.140> didn't<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> make<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> 5i

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you didn't really have to make it 5i

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
you didn't really have to make it 5i
sort<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.729> messes<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.479> same<00:01:45.659> cut<00:01:46.049> another

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
sort of messes up a bit same cut another

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
sort of messes up a bit same cut another
one<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.890> 5<00:01:47.159> 5<00:01:47.970> centimeter<00:01:48.420> piece<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
one out with 5 5 centimeter piece so I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.660 
one out with 5 5 centimeter piece so I
mark<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:50.000> there<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.990> 570<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.560> too

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.310 

so<00:01:56.670> make<00:01:56.820> another<00:01:57.119> 5<00:01:57.329> centimeter<00:01:57.780> piece<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so make another 5 centimeter piece and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.040 
so make another 5 centimeter piece and
then<00:01:58.740> I'll<00:01:59.189> show<00:01:59.219> you

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that means that this little piece can

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.289 
that means that this little piece can
fit<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> make<00:02:34.800> an<00:02:34.950> L<00:02:35.160> shape<00:02:35.459> like

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
fit in there to make an L shape like

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.470 
fit in there to make an L shape like
that<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:37.319> once<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.700> take<00:02:38.910> super

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that so once you get that you take super

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.440 
that so once you get that you take super
glue<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:42.440> glue<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.360> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
glue and you glue it in there do it on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
glue and you glue it in there do it on
all<00:02:45.569> edges<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.959> needs<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:47.040> strong

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
all edges just needs to be pretty strong

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.210 
all edges just needs to be pretty strong
so<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.209> does<00:02:48.420> most<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.930> work<00:02:49.220> on

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
so this is this does most of the work on

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.410 
so this is this does most of the work on
this<00:02:52.010> one's<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.099> little<00:02:53.190> bit<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.700> lets<00:02:54.150> you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
this one's a little bit what we lets you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.050 
this one's a little bit what we lets you
export<00:02:55.319> for<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.709> after<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.099> once<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
export for it after but once you have it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.720 
export for it after but once you have it
salt<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.329> clued<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:58.099> I'll<00:02:59.099> leave<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.489> dry

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
salt to clued in I'll leave that to dry

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.370 
salt to clued in I'll leave that to dry
you<00:03:00.180> take<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.530> these<00:03:01.799> pieces<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.670> Mark<00:03:03.380> or

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
you take one of these pieces and Mark or

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.229 
you take one of these pieces and Mark or
just<00:03:04.620> take<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.799> piece<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.489> ice<00:03:05.730> ball<00:03:06.060> stick<00:03:11.239> mark

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
just take a piece of ice ball stick mark

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.039 
just take a piece of ice ball stick mark
us<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.900> centimeter<00:03:13.410> down<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.329> cut<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
us one centimeter down and cut it to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.970 
us one centimeter down and cut it to
make<00:03:16.260> sure<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.500> doesn't<00:03:16.650> split<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:19.560> one<00:03:19.829> did

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
make sure it doesn't split this one did

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.440 
make sure it doesn't split this one did
a<00:03:20.069> bit<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.430> doesn't<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.000> matter<00:03:21.209> too

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
a bit that doesn't really matter too

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.979 
a bit that doesn't really matter too
much<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:23.180> glue<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:28.160> selby

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
much and then glue it like that selby

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.710 
much and then glue it like that selby
twice<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> strong<00:03:31.440> now<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.310> these<00:03:34.250> glue<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.340> it

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
twice a strong now so these glue on it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.050 
twice a strong now so these glue on it
make<00:03:36.720> sure<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:37.530> state<00:03:38.100> doesn't<00:03:38.459> split<00:03:38.850> like

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
make sure your state doesn't split like

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.920 
make sure your state doesn't split like
that

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.589 

and<00:03:46.560> will<00:03:46.709> either<00:03:47.250> file<00:03:47.879> it<00:03:48.090> down<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.420> shape

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
and will either file it down to shape

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.839 
and will either file it down to shape
afterwards<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.620> usually<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.670> basic

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
afterwards just usually have this basic

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.509 
afterwards just usually have this basic
thing<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.420> put<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.859> bit<00:03:52.859> of<00:03:52.890> glue<00:03:53.099> on<00:03:53.159> it<00:03:53.250> just

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
thing and put a bit of glue on it just

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.149 
thing and put a bit of glue on it just
to<00:03:53.609> make<00:03:53.760> sure<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:53.909> strong<00:03:54.829> is<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.010> top

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
to make sure it's strong is on the top

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.509 
to make sure it's strong is on the top
two<00:03:56.659> all<00:03:57.659> right<00:03:57.780> wait<00:03:57.959> for<00:03:58.109> that<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.230> dry<00:03:58.459> out<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
two all right wait for that to dry out a

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.220 
two all right wait for that to dry out a
better<00:03:59.760> way<00:03:59.879> of<00:04:00.000> gluing<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.659> second<00:04:01.109> piece

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
better way of gluing that second piece

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.929 
better way of gluing that second piece
on<00:04:01.469> is<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.829> get<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> piece<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.730> make<00:04:02.909> sure

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
on is just get a piece and make sure

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.610 
on is just get a piece and make sure
it's<00:04:03.180> straight<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.629> glue<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.049> on<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:04.409> that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
it's straight and glue that on like that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.910 
it's straight and glue that on like that
then<00:04:05.459> once<00:04:05.670> it's<00:04:05.849> dried<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.750> take<00:04:07.049> scissors

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
then once it's dried you take scissors

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.250 
then once it's dried you take scissors
or<00:04:08.280> whatever<00:04:08.790> you're<00:04:09.000> using<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:12.019> cut<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.139> off

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
or whatever you're using and cut it off

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.159 
or whatever you're using and cut it off
and<00:04:13.439> that<00:04:13.530> way<00:04:13.650> won't<00:04:13.920> crack<00:04:14.219> when<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:14.700> it

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
and that way won't crack when you do it

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.569 
and that way won't crack when you do it
then<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.289> have<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> nice<00:04:16.680> piece<00:04:16.949> like<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.190> and

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
then you have a nice piece like that and

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.539 
then you have a nice piece like that and
then<00:04:18.030> next<00:04:18.630> we're<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:19.259> to<00:04:19.380> make

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
then next we're going to have to make

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.550 
then next we're going to have to make
that<00:04:20.549> little<00:04:20.759> hook<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> end<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.870> all<00:04:22.169> you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that little hook in the end so all you

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.629 
that little hook in the end so all you
need<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.979> take<00:04:24.560> these<00:04:25.560> pins<00:04:26.009> you<00:04:26.190> should<00:04:26.370> find

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
need to take these pins you should find

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.320 
need to take these pins you should find
it<00:04:26.759> in<00:04:26.940> most<00:04:27.090> selling<00:04:27.599> kits<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:29.060> or<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.210> can

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
it in most selling kits so or you can

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.930 
it in most selling kits so or you can
use<00:04:30.389> whatever<00:04:30.599> you<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:31.020> find<00:04:31.259> to<00:04:31.470> make<00:04:31.650> these

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
use whatever you can find to make these

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.450 
use whatever you can find to make these
so<00:04:32.940> what<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.240> need<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.479> do<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:34.190> put<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.220> small

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
so what you need to do is put a small

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.150 
so what you need to do is put a small
mark<00:04:35.759> on<00:04:35.910> there<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> pin<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.560> then<00:04:37.740> put<00:04:38.039> this

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
mark on there the pin and then put this

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.760 
mark on there the pin and then put this
in<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.430> vise<00:04:38.639> or<00:04:39.000> whatever<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.620> I'm

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
in a vise or whatever you have so I'm

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.400 
in a vise or whatever you have so I'm
just<00:04:40.889> going<00:04:41.039> to<00:04:41.130> put<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:42.630> there<00:04:42.930> like

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
just going to put it in this there like

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.469 
just going to put it in this there like
that<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.800> put<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> hole<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.060> push<00:04:45.300> this

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
that and put a hole in it and push this

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.830 
that and put a hole in it and push this
in<00:04:45.720> so<00:04:45.960> I'll<00:04:46.020> show<00:04:46.229> what<00:04:46.349> it<00:04:46.440> looks<00:04:46.560> like<00:04:46.710> okay

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
in so I'll show what it looks like okay

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.450 
in so I'll show what it looks like okay
I<00:04:48.840> just<00:04:49.110> haven't<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.979> want<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.340> go

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
I just haven't that in you want it to go

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.969 
I just haven't that in you want it to go
in<00:04:50.580> about<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:51.030> far<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:51.870> fouta<00:04:52.500> coming<00:04:52.860> at

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
in about that far I'm fouta coming at

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.540 
in about that far I'm fouta coming at
the<00:04:53.130> end<00:04:53.159> well<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.680> don't<00:04:55.800> want<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.039> breaking

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
the end well you don't want to breaking

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.460 
the end well you don't want to breaking
out<00:04:56.789> like<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.479> did<00:04:57.690> but<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.139> doesn't

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
out like that one did but it doesn't

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.560 
out like that one did but it doesn't
really<00:04:58.800> matter<00:04:59.070> it's<00:04:59.250> just<00:04:59.360> easier<00:05:00.360> if<00:05:00.449> it

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
really matter it's just easier if it

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.420 
really matter it's just easier if it
doesn't<00:05:00.900> do<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:01.470> then<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.860> take<00:05:02.070> rule

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
doesn't do that and then you take rule

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.140 
doesn't do that and then you take rule
again<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:04.430> put<00:05:05.430> some<00:05:05.580> glue<00:05:05.760> on<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.940> top

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
again and you put some glue on the top

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.029 
again and you put some glue on the top
and<00:05:06.449> around<00:05:06.659> the<00:05:06.930> side<00:05:07.169> because<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.860> will

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
and around the side because it will

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.189 
and around the side because it will
crack<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> little<00:05:08.610> bit<00:05:08.840> not<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> problem<00:05:10.139> so<00:05:12.199> once

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
crack a little bit not a problem so once

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.680 
crack a little bit not a problem so once
you<00:05:13.289> wait<00:05:13.440> for<00:05:13.620> that<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.740> dry<00:05:13.889> you<00:05:14.610> put<00:05:14.639> a<00:05:14.909> curve

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
you wait for that to dry you put a curve

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.339 
you wait for that to dry you put a curve
in<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.250> ok<00:05:17.250> I'll<00:05:17.370> show<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.610> how<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.789> do<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:17.970> I

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
in it ok I'll show you how to do that I

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.399 
in it ok I'll show you how to do that I
know<00:05:19.349> that<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.650> dried<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.400> take<00:05:20.639> some

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
know that this is dried you take some

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.580 
know that this is dried you take some
small<00:05:22.409> pliers<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.449> grab<00:05:24.449> hold<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.110> top<00:05:25.320> of<00:05:25.470> it

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
small pliers and grab hold the top of it

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:34.350 
small pliers and grab hold the top of it
and<00:05:26.159> you<00:05:26.759> just<00:05:26.909> lightly<00:05:27.449> bend<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.110> like<00:05:29.599> that

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.460 

you<00:05:35.360> could<00:05:35.480> probably<00:05:35.660> even<00:05:35.840> take<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.170> pin<00:05:36.380> out

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
you could probably even take the pin out

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.940 
you could probably even take the pin out
then<00:05:36.710> bend<00:05:36.950> it<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.190> put<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.370> back<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.700> again

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
then bend it and put it back in again

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.720 
then bend it and put it back in again
that's<00:05:39.950> yeah<00:05:40.700> you<00:05:41.000> just<00:05:41.060> bend<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:43.430> like

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
that's yeah you just bend it in like

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:52.450 
that's yeah you just bend it in like
that<00:05:46.150> pulpit<00:05:47.150> back<00:05:51.160> yeah<00:05:52.160> that<00:05:52.370> would

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
that pulpit back yeah that would

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.430 
that pulpit back yeah that would
probably<00:05:52.490> do<00:05:52.850> just<00:05:53.360> like<00:05:53.510> that<00:05:53.660> just<00:05:53.870> me<00:05:54.230> make

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
probably do just like that just me make

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.400 
probably do just like that just me make
sure<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:54.740> not<00:05:54.920> over<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.340> ed<00:05:55.580> edge<00:05:56.410> it's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
sure it's not over that ed edge it's

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.660 
sure it's not over that ed edge it's
like<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.680> can<00:05:57.830> put<00:05:58.010> something<00:05:58.220> on<00:05:58.370> there<00:05:58.580> and

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
like you can put something on there and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.750 
like you can put something on there and
that's<00:05:58.820> not<00:05:58.970> like<00:05:59.980> thats<00:06:00.980> a<00:06:01.160> rubberband<00:06:01.610> will

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
that's not like thats a rubberband will

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.360 
that's not like thats a rubberband will
be<00:06:01.850> attached<00:06:02.830> to<00:06:05.110> these<00:06:06.110> two<00:06:06.410> so<00:06:07.100> we<00:06:07.220> have

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
be attached to these two so we have

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.230 
be attached to these two so we have
tension<00:06:07.610> on<00:06:07.820> them<00:06:08.530> okay<00:06:09.550> now<00:06:10.550> you<00:06:10.610> see<00:06:10.730> that

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
tension on them okay now you see that

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.560 
tension on them okay now you see that
I've<00:06:11.540> cut<00:06:11.780> those<00:06:12.710> two<00:06:12.980> bits<00:06:13.220> out<00:06:13.400> now<00:06:14.330> you<00:06:14.390> need

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
I've cut those two bits out now you need

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.500 
I've cut those two bits out now you need
to<00:06:14.600> get<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.810> file<00:06:15.170> and<00:06:15.560> file<00:06:16.070> it<00:06:16.310> out<00:06:16.460> so<00:06:16.790> your

little<00:06:18.440> lock<00:06:18.830> things<00:06:19.640> can<00:06:20.090> fit<00:06:21.910> into<00:06:22.910> them

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
little lock things can fit into them

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.840 
little lock things can fit into them
like<00:06:23.420> this<00:06:24.080> one<00:06:24.290> gems<00:06:24.590> a<00:06:24.740> bit<00:06:24.920> but<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.580> make

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
like this one gems a bit but you make

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.140 
like this one gems a bit but you make
sure<00:06:25.970> they<00:06:26.060> can<00:06:26.210> fit<00:06:26.510> in<00:06:26.540> really<00:06:27.110> easily<00:06:28.150> like

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
sure they can fit in really easily like

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.180 
sure they can fit in really easily like
that<00:06:29.360> okay<00:06:30.050> I'll<00:06:30.200> file<00:06:30.440> those<00:06:30.680> little<00:06:31.010> bits

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
that okay I'll file those little bits

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.100 
that okay I'll file those little bits
down<00:06:31.370> there<00:06:31.610> and<00:06:31.700> you<00:06:31.790> can<00:06:31.910> see<00:06:32.060> they<00:06:32.300> going

really easy okay and these will have a
rubber<00:06:37.820> band<00:06:38.120> attached<00:06:38.710> to<00:06:39.710> them<00:06:39.830> both<00:06:40.040> and

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
rubber band attached to them both and

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.400 
rubber band attached to them both and
there'll<00:06:40.670> be<00:06:40.700> a<00:06:40.850> little<00:06:41.180> I<00:06:41.390> don't<00:06:42.140> know<00:06:42.260> what

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
it's called on like a little piece on

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.600 
it's called on like a little piece on
the<00:06:45.170> blade<00:06:45.440> and<00:06:45.680> these<00:06:45.920> will<00:06:46.100> catch<00:06:46.310> on<00:06:46.490> the

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
the blade and these will catch on the

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.030 
the blade and these will catch on the
blade<00:06:46.820> pull<00:06:47.690> back<00:06:47.960> and<00:06:48.080> Flickr<00:06:48.350> blade<00:06:48.650> forward

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
blade pull back and Flickr blade forward

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040 
blade pull back and Flickr blade forward
so<00:06:49.310> that's<00:06:49.970> what<00:06:50.090> all<00:06:50.210> the<00:06:50.360> locks<00:06:50.570> are<00:06:50.750> for<00:06:50.930> and

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
so that's what all the locks are for and

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.650 
so that's what all the locks are for and
that's<00:06:51.110> what<00:06:51.260> they're<00:06:51.500> for<00:06:51.530> so<00:06:52.520> I'll<00:06:52.910> explain

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.800 
here you need to file grind or somehow
get<00:07:05.720> it<00:07:05.870> down<00:07:06.140> to<00:07:06.169> size<00:07:06.560> with<00:07:06.890> still<00:07:07.340> being

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
get it down to size with still being

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.100 
get it down to size with still being
flat<00:07:08.810> so<00:07:09.169> when<00:07:09.320> you<00:07:09.410> put<00:07:09.620> it<00:07:09.710> on<00:07:09.860> here<00:07:11.110> it's

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
flat so when you put it on here it's

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.490 
flat so when you put it on here it's
just<00:07:13.070> resting<00:07:13.669> on<00:07:13.820> the<00:07:13.940> top<00:07:14.150> of<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.480> blade<00:07:14.720> not

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
just resting on the top of the blade not

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.260 
just resting on the top of the blade not
quite<00:07:15.770> touching<00:07:16.040> it<00:07:16.310> like<00:07:16.490> this<00:07:16.850> one<00:07:17.000> is<00:07:17.120> a<00:07:17.150> bit

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
quite touching it like this one is a bit

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.570 
quite touching it like this one is a bit
but<00:07:17.690> you<00:07:18.440> want<00:07:18.590> it<00:07:18.650> so<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:18.830> can<00:07:18.950> still<00:07:19.160> move<00:07:19.340> it

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
but you want it so you can still move it

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.990 
but you want it so you can still move it
and<00:07:19.700> it's<00:07:20.210> flat<00:07:20.510> on<00:07:20.690> top<00:07:20.810> where<00:07:21.350> if<00:07:21.590> I<00:07:22.100> put<00:07:22.370> this

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
and it's flat on top where if I put this

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.730 
and it's flat on top where if I put this
one<00:07:23.240> on<00:07:23.270> here<00:07:23.540> that<00:07:23.600> hasn't<00:07:23.870> been<00:07:24.050> cut<00:07:24.710> down

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
one on here that hasn't been cut down

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.420 
one on here that hasn't been cut down
you<00:07:25.100> see<00:07:25.280> how<00:07:25.460> it<00:07:25.520> helps<00:07:26.210> lift<00:07:26.390> it<00:07:26.540> off<00:07:27.430> you're

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
you see how it helps lift it off you're

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.700 
you see how it helps lift it off you're
going<00:07:28.640> to<00:07:28.730> need<00:07:28.850> it<00:07:28.970> so<00:07:29.090> it's<00:07:29.240> just<00:07:29.710> really

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
going to need it so it's just really

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.310 
going to need it so it's just really
flat<00:07:31.580> on<00:07:32.570> there<00:07:32.990> like<00:07:33.770> that<00:07:34.780> so<00:07:35.780> cut<00:07:35.990> them<00:07:36.169> both

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320 
flat on there like that so cut them both

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.190 
flat on there like that so cut them both
down<00:07:36.590> so<00:07:36.770> they're<00:07:36.890> like<00:07:37.070> that<00:07:37.690> but<00:07:38.690> not<00:07:38.870> don't

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:39.200

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.680 
down so they're like that but not don't
have<00:07:39.350> them<00:07:39.500> so<00:07:39.530> they're<00:07:39.770> too<00:07:39.950> high<00:07:40.190> up<00:07:40.600> or<00:07:41.600> else

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.690 
have them so they're too high up or else

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.180 
have them so they're too high up or else
you<00:07:41.870> won't<00:07:42.140> be<00:07:42.289> able<00:07:42.350> to<00:07:42.470> catch<00:07:42.620> the<00:07:42.830> blade<00:07:43.010> but

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
you won't be able to catch the blade but

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.810 
you won't be able to catch the blade but
