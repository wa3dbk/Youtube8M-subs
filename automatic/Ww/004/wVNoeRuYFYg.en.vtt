00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.540
 hi welcome on learning the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.060
 battery points like a little video 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.980
 to explain to you what the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.800
 training but first break at the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.210
 battery to whom she addresses what she 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.230
 contains how they unfold and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.669
 etc etc. 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.200
 so this training was born from the 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.880
 request of many of some of 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.350
 you and many tell us this is I 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.640
 do that a real only on the battery I did 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.070
 no other because you that our subscribers 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.109
 or while a game by in a brief I 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.180
 falls back next I do not know where I'm going 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.320
 so here at the office I said I'm going 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.329
 do some training something 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.140
 accurate to try to solve these 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.910
 problems but then to whom is it addressed 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.469
 this training is for all 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.730
 beginners who want to enrich their 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.239
 vocabulary at the breaks of 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.579
 batteries as his name says it all 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.859
 that in a binary context no jazz 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.300
 not if after that or whatever it is 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.480
 really sure of the binary and whether it's 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 clear what level do I have in the 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.890
 descriptions below I put a link 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.880
 on to two courses 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.980
 my first true that the battery is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.360
 my first league struggling to beat here you 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.000
 are able to read and understand 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 its two short you can integrate the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.270
 training she starts from this level there 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.270
 it was calculated for that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.250
 co contains gonthier training loos 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.730
 this training I will speak first 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.070
 of the xl version because the version s 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.950
 no one is neither more nor less than 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.010
 version xl cut and so you go 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 understand immediately the xl version 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.900
 contains 140 and a pdf exercise 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.880
 downloadable which makes a 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.360
 forty pages and still three 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.360
 hours of video 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.540
 dispatched in fact they will deal 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.050
 of 4 rhythmic cells which are they 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 even divided into two short so the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.020
 first course on each rhythmic cd itself 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.479
 pass on the pad where we will visualize the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 cell understand it integrate it into the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 game and in the measure on a time then 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.240
 in the extent to move it in the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.550
 able to work seven cells 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.780
 rhythmic with the story aloud 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.500
 once you get to work these 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.570
 exercises the next course and it's this 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
 that have even contain rhythmic CDU 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.690
 but on the drums and there we work 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.050
 this host cell is nicking on the battery 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.450
 in different lankan the first 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 part the first stitching of each 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.040
 these two other mines that question 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.180
 is not to serve later on to 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 work these flexibilities of 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.700
 wrist is to say that you will have 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.010
 built-in each of the exercises you go 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 be able to climb in speed and 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.990
 soften your wrists with these 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.519
 exercises these exercises there when we 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.750
 goes on the court on the battery well 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.070
 heard we are working this cell of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.780
 rhythm they will integrate it rhythmically 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.560
 we serve executed against the accounts 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.000
 and then we will work 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 the orchestration and you'll see at 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
 how and to what extent 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.060
 from a rhythmic cell that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.530
 insane everything on the snare I'm going 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.630
 orchestrated differently on the drums 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.970
 look for ideas you will understand 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.220
 my way of doing the thing and then it's okay 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.780
 you come to you 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.100
 you will integrate this way that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 you go get your ideas and you 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.180
 have developed your game with this master 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.310
 loeb this method there what is when 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 not bad, that's where you go 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.170
 to what you like and find 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.790
 orchestrations you like in 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.660
 function of your personality the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 music you play 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.640
 and if follows it so I think it's 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.890
 know it's not useless the version s 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.860
 as for it contains only one 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.280
 rhythmic cell not 4 so what makes 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.020
 short dispatcher such cashier 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.700
 clear battery and all on two 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.760
 weeks while the xl version its 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.410
 eight races over eight weeks 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.970
 when you sign up the courses get 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.860
 it happens like that you register Monday 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.270
 the Monday after seven days after you 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.600
 receive the second course and so of 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.220
 after 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.690
 if you sign up on friday this 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.700
 will be on Friday okay if the party 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.870
 rolling you register your mails 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.140
 had the courses arrive a week 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.140
 after 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.590
 so this training the big version x 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.989
 142 exercise three hours of videos the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.260
 version s 42 years of exercise 1h10 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.260
 videos 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.500
 this training was recorded in 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.390
 studio with two camera angles 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.220
 that's what leaves you especially that I 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.070
 am native of a camera passes neither camera 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:40.580
 above to see the coordinations and 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:42.950
 play on the drums for those who 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.450
 will take the xl version in addition to the eight 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.150
 short of eight weeks of France 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.390
 training you are entitled to one hour of 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.650
 coaching with me via skype or for those 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.020
 who are in the Paris region one hour 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.790
 of course with me 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.110
 in my local which is located 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.730
 at most five times that say more than 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.770
 suspense that I went around this 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.690
 training is accessible for life 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 may evolve over time you 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.680
 enjoy the evolutions of course 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.680
 when you are and what you paid 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.480
 the only thing I can say is 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.070
 that there I open the inscriptions to this 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.570
 training if ever there really was 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.030
 a lot of people with the hours of 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.680
 coaching and the fact that you can 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.450
 ask your questions also in relation to 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.850
 through the application form 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.040
 comments from below will give me 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.980
 still a bit of work and if 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.270
 really it was loaded I risk 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.870
 close registrations and maybe 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.040
 the Herault will see after so as to be able to 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:49.400
 manage it taf my work next 6 me 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.960
 follow that's it I think I said everything 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.750
 so for each course in pdf to 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.400
 download below the video I 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.510
 look at my notes there I do like 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.810
 presenter of the television news 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.090
 yeah I said everything here it's great 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.450
 so in pdf pdf to download under 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.750
 every video with the exercises are 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.750
 with 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.470
 here I think I said everything 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.890
 so I hope you'll like that 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.150
 as you will agree and then I will 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.820
 to be able to resume the normal rhythm of 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.560
 courses which are free of charge on the 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.230
 site soon
