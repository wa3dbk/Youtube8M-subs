00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the first gaming freezes one hundred

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.250 
the first gaming freezes one hundred
percent<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.630> time<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> literally

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
percent of the time like it literally

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
percent of the time like it literally
froze<00:00:25.619> every<00:00:26.010> single<00:00:26.160> time<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.580> why<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
froze every single time that's why I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.820 
froze every single time that's why I
wasn't<00:00:27.029> able<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.359> videos<00:00:27.830> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
wasn't able to do videos and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
wasn't able to do videos and
unfortunately<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.640> tried<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.240> offline<00:00:30.630> at

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
unfortunately I tried to do offline at

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.150 
unfortunately I tried to do offline at
one<00:00:31.320> point<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.830> those<00:00:32.009> reasons

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
one point you know what those reasons

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
one point you know what those reasons
like<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.669> maybe<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> has<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.300> online

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
like you know maybe it has to do online

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
like you know maybe it has to do online
so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> went<00:00:34.140> offline<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.920> try<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.149> once

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so I went offline and try that but once

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.389 
so I went offline and try that but once
you<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> once<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.620> offline<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.250> any

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you do that once you go offline at any

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.540 
you do that once you go offline at any
point<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.690> collect<00:00:40.469> vc<00:00:40.980> anymore<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
point you don't collect vc anymore it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
point you don't collect vc anymore it
turns<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:42.140> skill<00:00:43.140> points<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
turns into skill points and the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
turns into skill points and the
difference<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.760> VC<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.000> get

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
difference is that you need a VC to get

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
difference is that you need a VC to get
accessories<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.800> things<00:00:50.039> like

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
accessories and you know things like

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
accessories and you know things like
that<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.670> once<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.899> patch<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> everything

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that so once the patch and everything

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.090 
that so once the patch and everything
was<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.640> set<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.360> played<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> looked

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
was all set I played and then I looked

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
was all set I played and then I looked
and<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.489> couldn't<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.879> VC<00:00:57.300> anymore<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> had

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and I couldn't get VC anymore so I had

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.819 
and I couldn't get VC anymore so I had
to<00:00:58.079> start<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.500> over<00:00:59.300> man<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.320> start<00:01:01.620> over

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to start all over man so we start over

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
to start all over man so we start over
and<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.340> had<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:03.210> better<00:01:03.539> outing<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and we had an even better outing at the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
and we had an even better outing at the
rookie<00:01:04.680> showcase<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.580> projected

driving<00:05:00.610> going<00:05:01.150> around<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.450> back<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.840> know

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
driving going around the back you know

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.040 
driving going around the back you know
doing<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.260> hop<00:05:02.410> step<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.690> right<00:05:04.690> there<00:05:04.900> we

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
doing a hop step and right there we

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.230 
doing a hop step and right there we
could<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:05.440> get<00:05:05.530> another<00:05:05.650> foul<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:07.150> was
