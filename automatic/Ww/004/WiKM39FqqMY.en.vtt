00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
stays in for like 30 seconds which I

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.839 
stays in for like 30 seconds which I
thought<00:04:07.290> was<00:04:07.470> obviously<00:04:07.889> pretty<00:04:08.100> cool<00:04:08.459> cuz<00:04:08.790> I

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
thought was obviously pretty cool cuz I

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.970 
thought was obviously pretty cool cuz I
got<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> triple<00:04:09.239> kill<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.650> got<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.890> like

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
got a triple kill and I just got it like
