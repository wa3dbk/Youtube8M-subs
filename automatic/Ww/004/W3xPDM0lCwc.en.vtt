00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.210
 an eighth level premium tank to your 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.420
 choice except for those machines that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.609
 were withdrawn from sale and also for participation 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the shootings we pour some gold 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.420
 all the details about how to compete for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.460
 your dream tank are in our 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 group vkontakte link to which we 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.180
 left in the description of this video as well 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.180
 now starting 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 today instead of 10 participants we took 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.330
 as many as 20 but of these 20 only 10 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 will go on and that means everyone 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.790
 tankman odds are about 50 by 50 since 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.220
 we selected tank crews with 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.410
 random number generator then the chance that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.390
 one of the participants will know a friend 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.629
 friend is extremely small so the first 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.160
 test for luck rather than skill 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.220
 the essence of the presentation is simple 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.710
 robin center field and 20t first 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.759
 lined up in a circle but what will 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.759
 then I think you understand 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 as soon as the go-ahead was given 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 few seconds many beautiful and 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.729
 brand new t1 turned into a bunch 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.979
 scrap metal and only those survived 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.939
 10 lucky ones to be 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.939
 fight on 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.230
 cold bridge navin storm does not promise 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.810
 nothing good for 6 semi finalists out 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.850
 10 applicants everything is very simple t1 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.910
 line up and on command 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.430
 begin to shove bite and in every way 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.660
 push out your competitors if anyone 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.110
 will come out on the pavement 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.369
 it will be considered as desertion and 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.369
 accordingly defeat will be counted 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.460
 start given and after a short standing 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
 action starts to happen 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.190
 the first one is maxcut and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.190
 out of competition 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.630
 next t1 who play for themselves 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.870
 collectively pushing leksa three 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.870
 nine 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.980
 after a short pause 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.980
 He is substituted there 1122 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.070
 bandicoot thefts have long fought for life 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.070
 still could not stay on the bridge 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.239
 after a long tank ballet under 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.239
 applause throw Lech cord 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.270
 well, the last one loses its place in 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.290
 final mr co reus 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.900
 we still have three finalists who already 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.930
 came up with some tanks they want to get 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.180
 and feel like winners however 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.360
 ahead they have the most difficult 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.910
 test 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.790
 Murovanka A bunch of bushes hills hills 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.450
 obstacles and houses for which t1 can 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.959
 easy to hide and you ask from what 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.090
 im hiding yes from this very machine 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.470
 the killers 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.040
 waffentrager e100 which driving 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.840
 I spent the same 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.610
 survive by any means 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.979
 which means you can hide 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.280
 sabotage to ask for help 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.100
 or surrender on the spot however no 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.700
 mercy to those who did not hide I give no 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.600
 intends to go to the center of the card and counting 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.970
 Up to 180 the wafer will start to search and who does not 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.950
 hid I'm not guilty 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.650
 after starting the first thing I decided 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.960
 check the rear after all it's so banal that 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.539
 having gone from my base back to her I 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.470
 most likely I will not return so there 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.169
 safely 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.840
 that is exactly what the player with the nickname considered hardcore 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.240
 he was never wrong 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.400
 less than two minutes like ours 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.680
 just two t left 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.530
 and one of them will lose a 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.140
 another to become a winner and take your 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.330
 prize after a little thought 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.250
 preferred to drive along the edge of the map and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.100
 see if anyone is there 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.100
 small and red in the upper left 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.690
 the corner turned purely around and 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.280
 I give the pedal to the floor to the side 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.280
 opposite a 0 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.249
 and 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.949
 driving closer I felt like 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.710
 what exactly is the victim 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:54.249
 a little digging in the bushes I found in 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.710
 give it first past 2 in goal this 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.719
 the very moment of pawns ice seeing in combat 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.589
 log death of his teammate for 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.649
 exulted 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.969
 it was he who tactfully sat down on the hill 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.520
 bottom left of the map 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.009
 through the bushes monitored the approach to his 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.009
 positions and even if I went right away 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.659
 there when he saw me a mile away he could easily 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.289
 would hide in the other direction 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:20.349

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.960
