we<00:00:11.750> decided<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.320> draw<00:00:12.500> on<00:00:12.620> Goya<00:00:12.860> we<00:00:13.610> got

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
we decided to draw on Goya we got

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.119 
we decided to draw on Goya we got
someone<00:00:14.299> from<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.320> gallery<00:00:15.620> to<00:00:15.769> go<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:16.010> buy

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
someone from the gallery to go and buy

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.400 
someone from the gallery to go and buy
them<00:00:16.309> for<00:00:16.490> us<00:00:16.640> we<00:00:17.510> suggested<00:00:18.050> that<00:00:18.080> we<00:00:18.290> were

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
them for us we suggested that we were

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.009 
them for us we suggested that we were
going<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:18.620> have<00:00:18.950> a<00:00:18.980> slush<00:00:19.580> fund<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.750> that<00:00:20.779> the

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
going to have a slush fund so that the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.019 
going to have a slush fund so that the
money<00:00:21.199> that<00:00:21.289> was<00:00:21.650> hopefully<00:00:22.609> working

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
money that was hopefully working

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.339 
money that was hopefully working
freighters<00:00:23.390> by<00:00:23.510> selling<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.930> first<00:00:24.140> word

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
freighters by selling the first word

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.380 
freighters by selling the first word
will<00:00:24.560> go<00:00:24.680> into<00:00:24.830> buying<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:25.189> second<00:00:25.490> set<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:26.359> that

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
will go into buying a second set so that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.870 
will go into buying a second set so that
again<00:00:26.960> we<00:00:27.140> would<00:00:27.320> turn<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.679> form<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:28.010> kind<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:28.789> a

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
again we would turn it form a kind of a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240 
again we would turn it form a kind of a
conceptual<00:00:29.599> or<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:30.140> relax<00:00:30.529> into<00:00:30.800> something

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
conceptual or just relax into something

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.910 
conceptual or just relax into something
which<00:00:31.400> was<00:00:31.580> much<00:00:31.789> more<00:00:31.900> malevolent<00:00:32.900> which<00:00:33.770> is

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
which was much more malevolent which is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.290 
which was much more malevolent which is
to<00:00:34.040> which<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:34.430> say<00:00:34.580> that<00:00:34.790> if<00:00:34.880> we<00:00:34.970> get<00:00:35.180> our

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
to which is to say that if we get our

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.270 
to which is to say that if we get our
hands<00:00:35.540> on<00:00:35.719> every<00:00:35.960> toy<00:00:36.230> asset<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:36.770> will<00:00:36.920> draw<00:00:37.100> on

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
hands on every toy asset we will draw on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.119 
hands on every toy asset we will draw on
them<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:41.450> idea<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.930> drawing<00:00:42.500> on<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.739> work<00:00:42.890> was

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
them the idea of drawing on the work was

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.910 
them the idea of drawing on the work was
a<00:00:43.160> way<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.520> amplifying<00:00:44.469> some<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.680> more

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
a way of amplifying some of the more

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.810 
a way of amplifying some of the more
monstrous<00:00:46.610> or<00:00:47.649> abject<00:00:48.649> elements<00:00:49.489> of<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.670> work

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
monstrous or abject elements of the work

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.250 
monstrous or abject elements of the work
which<00:00:50.059> kind<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.390> mean<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.780> maybe<00:00:51.020> perhaps

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
which kind of mean and maybe perhaps

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.889 
which kind of mean and maybe perhaps
tease<00:00:52.039> them<00:00:52.250> out<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.730> mean<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.239> point<00:00:53.629> about

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
tease them out I mean the point about

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.930 
tease them out I mean the point about
Goya<00:00:54.289> making<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.980> disaster<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:55.460> war<00:00:55.609> was<00:00:55.789> that

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
Goya making the disaster of war was that

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.510 
Goya making the disaster of war was that
it<00:00:56.030> was<00:00:56.180> about<00:00:56.359> wide<00:00:56.780> dissemination<00:00:57.399> you<00:00:58.399> know

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
it was about wide dissemination you know

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.569 
it was about wide dissemination you know
the<00:00:58.640> etching<00:00:58.910> press<00:00:59.180> was<00:00:59.480> about<00:00:59.809> kind<00:01:00.079> of

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
the etching press was about kind of

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.439 
the etching press was about kind of
distribution<00:01:01.579> rather<00:01:01.820> than<00:01:02.149> kind<00:01:02.329> of

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
distribution rather than kind of

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.479 
distribution rather than kind of
scarcity<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.530> what<00:01:03.710> we're<00:01:03.920> doing<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.340> we're

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
scarcity but what we're doing is we're

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.400 
scarcity but what we're doing is we're
verifying<00:01:04.730> a<00:01:05.210> work<00:01:05.390> by<00:01:05.540> drawing<00:01:05.810> on<00:01:06.050> them<00:01:06.200> so

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
verifying a work by drawing on them so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.810 
verifying a work by drawing on them so
that<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.620> know<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.920> effect<00:01:07.220> what<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:07.520> can<00:01:07.670> do

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
that you know in effect what we can do

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.960 
that you know in effect what we can do
is<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.570> deplete<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.310> numbers<00:01:10.700> that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
is that we can deplete the numbers that

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.400 
is that we can deplete the numbers that
are<00:01:11.060> available<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:11.750> perhaps<00:01:12.020> they<00:01:12.290> do

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
are available so that perhaps they do

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.560 
are available so that perhaps they do
become<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.010> know<00:01:13.120> rarer<00:01:14.120> than<00:01:14.360> rocky

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
become you know rarer than rocky

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.430 
become you know rarer than rocky
horseshit

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
horseshit

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.880 
horseshit
I<00:01:17.170> think<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.260> question<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.710> being

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
I think the question that being

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.260 
I think the question that being
vandalism<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.550> actually<00:01:19.910> technically

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
vandalism is actually technically

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.660 
vandalism is actually technically
incorrect<00:01:20.900> as<00:01:21.530> vandalism<00:01:21.980> is<00:01:22.220> kind<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.460> news

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
incorrect as vandalism is kind of news

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.420 
incorrect as vandalism is kind of news
normally<00:01:23.500> schematically<00:01:24.500> destructive<00:01:25.160> when

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
normally schematically destructive when

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.220 
normally schematically destructive when
what<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.730> did<00:01:25.910> with<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.180> Goya<00:01:26.390> pictures<00:01:27.020> was

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
what we did with the Goya pictures was

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.950 
what we did with the Goya pictures was
was<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.710> draw<00:01:27.950> on<00:01:28.130> them<00:01:28.280> very<00:01:28.310> delicately<00:01:29.150> so

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
was to draw on them very delicately so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.780 
was to draw on them very delicately so
they're<00:01:30.560> moreover<00:01:31.160> drawings<00:01:31.490> than<00:01:31.670> they<00:01:31.760> are

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
they're moreover drawings than they are

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.030 
they're moreover drawings than they are
acts<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.960> vandalism

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
acts of vandalism

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
acts of vandalism
it's<00:01:35.550> an<00:01:35.640> act<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.970> arisia<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.540> sorts<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's an act of arisia of sorts so it's a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
it's an act of arisia of sorts so it's a
way<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> making<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.280> point<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.760> making<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> point

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
way of making a point but making a point

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.320 
way of making a point but making a point
quite<00:01:39.720> firmly<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.940> that's<00:01:42.060> part<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
quite firmly but I think that's part of

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.760 
quite firmly but I think that's part of
our<00:01:42.480> argument<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.140> Goya<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.470> part<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
our argument about the Goya as part of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
our argument about the Goya as part of
the<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.370> institutional<00:01:45.030> framework<00:01:45.060> that's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the the institutional framework that's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
the the institutional framework that's
kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> somehow<00:01:46.290> suppresses<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.130> work<00:01:47.280> by

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
kind of somehow suppresses the work by

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.360 
kind of somehow suppresses the work by
this<00:01:47.580> kind<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> absurd<00:01:48.900> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.470> ethical

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
this kind of absurd kind of ethical

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.980 
this kind of absurd kind of ethical
dynamic<00:01:51.120> which<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.510> say<00:01:51.660> that<00:01:51.690> these

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
dynamic which is to say that these

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.750 
dynamic which is to say that these
images<00:01:52.260> are<00:01:52.530> almost<00:01:53.130> journalistic

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
images are almost journalistic

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.470 
images are almost journalistic
depictions<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> atrocity<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.820> actually<00:01:57.300> look

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
depictions of atrocity you actually look

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.660 
depictions of atrocity you actually look
at<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.690> Goya<00:01:57.840> prism<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.470> know<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.370> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
at the Goya prism you know the the the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.050 
at the Goya prism you know the the the
the<00:01:59.850> degree<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.160> artists<00:02:02.580> interest

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the degree of of the artists interest

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
the degree of of the artists interest
kind<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.480> gravitates<00:02:04.050> towards<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> areas<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
kind of gravitates towards the areas of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 
kind of gravitates towards the areas of
Blas<00:02:05.190> eration<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.940> castration<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.900> cutting

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Blas eration and castration and cutting

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.800 
Blas eration and castration and cutting
and<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:08.850> they<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> undermine

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and so in a way they kind of undermine

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
and so in a way they kind of undermine
the<00:02:09.960> moral<00:02:10.260> framework<00:02:10.740> that's<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.160> seems

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the moral framework that's that seems

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
the moral framework that's that seems
frame<00:02:11.700> by<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
frame by and I think this is this is a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.260 
frame by and I think this is this is a
matter<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.550> looking<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> work

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
matter of actually looking at the work

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.300 
matter of actually looking at the work
and<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.050> by<00:02:16.350> drawing<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> work<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and so I think by drawing on the work I

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.560 
and so I think by drawing on the work I
think<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.640> were<00:02:17.760> trying<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.330> to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
think we were trying to get people to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020 
think we were trying to get people to
look<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> work
