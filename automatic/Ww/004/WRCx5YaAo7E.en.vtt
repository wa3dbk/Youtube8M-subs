if I didn't I wouldn't have a youtube
channel<00:00:27.930> simple<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.570> know

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
channel simple as that so I don't know

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.849

actually<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> why<00:00:31.710> they

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
actually actually I don't know why they

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.229 
actually actually I don't know why they
think<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> coming<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.730> sooner<00:00:33.030> because

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
think of coming out here sooner because

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.010 
think of coming out here sooner because
it's<00:00:33.540> always<00:00:34.200> empty<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.860> quiet<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
guess I don't like sitting outside in
the<00:00:38.820> cold<00:00:38.969> weather<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.450> either<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the cold weather but either way if the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
the cold weather but either way if the
audio<00:00:40.770> quality<00:00:40.980> isn't<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.670> just

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
audio quality isn't that good just

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
audio quality isn't that good just
remember<00:00:42.000> i'm<00:00:42.390> outside<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.829> an

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
remember i'm outside and not in like an

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.209 
remember i'm outside and not in like an
enclosed<00:00:44.489> room<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.120> normally<00:00:45.180> am<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> my

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
enclosed room like i normally am so my

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889

any effect on my voice I guess we'll

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.939
