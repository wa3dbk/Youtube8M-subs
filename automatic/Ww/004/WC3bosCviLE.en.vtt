00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
awesome video so let's start off with

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.599 
awesome video so let's start off with
the<00:00:27.150> front<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.539> usual<00:00:27.840> now<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.609> 27-inch

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the front as usual now this is a 27-inch

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.609 
the front as usual now this is a 27-inch
monitor<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.420> actually<00:00:30.840> looks<00:00:31.050> pretty<00:00:31.349> cool

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
monitor and actually looks pretty cool

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.680 
monitor and actually looks pretty cool
has<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> fairly<00:00:32.369> small<00:00:32.730> footprint<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
has a fairly small footprint which I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.860 
has a fairly small footprint which I
like<00:00:33.960> quite<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.000> that's<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.540> much

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
like quite a lot and that's pretty much

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
like quite a lot and that's pretty much
it<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:37.649> quite<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.010> basic<00:00:38.340> monitor

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it it's actually quite a basic monitor

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
it it's actually quite a basic monitor
in<00:00:39.420> many<00:00:40.079> senses<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.100> stand<00:00:41.340> doesn't<00:00:41.610> really

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
in many senses the stand doesn't really

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
in many senses the stand doesn't really
do<00:00:41.910> anything<00:00:42.090> fancy<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.750> fact<00:00:43.110> there's<00:00:43.350> no

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
do anything fancy in fact there's no

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
do anything fancy in fact there's no
height<00:00:44.250> adjust<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:45.000> no<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.110> pivot<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
height adjust or no you know pivot to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.819 
height adjust or no you know pivot to
make<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> portrait<00:00:47.940> mode<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.300> even<00:00:49.289> rotation

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
make it portrait mode or even rotation

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
make it portrait mode or even rotation
you<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.160> turn<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.899> very

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you just turn the thing so it's very

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
you just turn the thing so it's very
simple<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:52.949> tilt<00:00:53.190> though<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
simple you do get some tilt though I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
simple you do get some tilt though I
believe<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.120> 22<00:00:54.690> minus<00:00:54.989> 5<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.350> usual

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
believe that 22 minus 5 as usual

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.439 
believe that 22 minus 5 as usual
although<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> hold<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> base

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
although you do have to hold the base

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
although you do have to hold the base
down<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.020> plan<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.289> tilting<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
down if you do plan on tilting it as the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
down if you do plan on tilting it as the
base<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.940> isn't<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> heavy<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.930> but

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
base really isn't that heavy at all but

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
base really isn't that heavy at all but
the<00:01:01.590> overall<00:01:01.859> monitor<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.640> heavy<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the overall monitor is pretty heavy in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.080 
the overall monitor is pretty heavy in
fact<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.690> imagine<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.170> being<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.619> great

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
fact I would imagine this being a great

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.310 
fact I would imagine this being a great
monitor<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.270> take<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> Land's<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
monitor to take to Land's as you can

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.170 
monitor to take to Land's as you can
just<00:01:07.680> pick<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.280> put<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.670> somewhere

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just pick it up put it down somewhere

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
just pick it up put it down somewhere
and<00:01:09.240> play<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and play then make it all work now the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
and play then make it all work now the
actual<00:01:12.420> base<00:01:12.570> itself<00:01:12.869> has<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> cool<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.100> RL

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
actual base itself has a cool little RL

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
actual base itself has a cool little RL

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can only use a flathead with it as far

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
can only use a flathead with it as far
as<00:01:38.579> iPhone<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.960> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.799> the

there's actually a glossy plastic Remer
on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> edge<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.119> should<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.360> a

on the edge as well which should give a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
on the edge as well which should give a
strange<00:01:57.750> knot<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.399> attempt

to do two shots at the same time here
we've<00:02:01.500> got<00:02:01.619> vga<00:02:02.040> DVI<00:02:02.210> D<00:02:03.210> two<00:02:04.170> HDMI<00:02:04.619> ports<00:02:05.100> both

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we've got vga DVI D two HDMI ports both

we've got vga DVI D two HDMI ports both
for<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> believe<00:02:06.270> console<00:02:06.810> use<00:02:07.079> mainly<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
for I believe console use mainly and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.990 
for I believe console use mainly and
then<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.479> line<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.140> headphone<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
then also the line in headphone out and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.770 
then also the line in headphone out and
the<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.930> AC<00:02:13.370> kettle<00:02:14.370> lead<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.390> that's

the the AC kettle lead in so that's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020 
the the AC kettle lead in so that's
pretty<00:02:16.260> much<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.680> terms<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.980> IO<00:02:17.130> except<00:02:17.820> for

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
pretty much it in terms of IO except for

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270 
pretty much it in terms of IO except for
the<00:02:18.210> menu<00:02:18.570> buttons<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> front<00:02:19.470> though<00:02:20.100> we

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
wouldn't put anything too heavy on here

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.680 
wouldn't put anything too heavy on here
as<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.590> monitor<00:02:58.980> may<00:02:59.370> tip<00:02:59.850> towards<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.570> know

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690

the back of the wall or whatever it is
so<00:03:02.550> yeah<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.270> be<00:03:03.360> careful<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.750> though<00:03:04.590> in

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so yeah just be careful that though in

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.470 
so yeah just be careful that though in
terms<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:05.070> experience<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:05.790> monitor<00:03:06.209> even

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
terms of experience with monitor even

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
terms of experience with monitor even
though<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.990> TN<00:03:07.350> panel<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.830> has<00:03:07.860> some

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
though this is a TN panel it has some

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.740 
though this is a TN panel it has some
really<00:03:08.550> great<00:03:08.850> viewing<00:03:09.240> angles

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
really great viewing angles

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.520 
really great viewing angles
honestly<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.880> I'd<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.000> motors<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.630> standing

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
honestly it I'd the motors like standing

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.250 
honestly it I'd the motors like standing
at<00:03:13.740> 178<00:03:14.640> degrees<00:03:14.970> from<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> monitor<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
at 178 degrees from the monitor and I

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
at 178 degrees from the monitor and I
could<00:03:16.440> still<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> colors<00:03:17.400> pretty

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
could still see all the colors pretty

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.330 
could still see all the colors pretty
well<00:03:18.209> in<00:03:18.480> terms<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.200> uh<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.620> vertical

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
well in terms of uh you know vertical

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.970 
well in terms of uh you know vertical
and<00:03:20.670> they<00:03:20.850> weren't<00:03:21.060> too<00:03:21.150> bad<00:03:21.390> either<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:22.769> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
and they weren't too bad either but the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.710 
and they weren't too bad either but the
biggest<00:03:23.400> thing<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.730> me<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.510> make<00:03:24.690> it

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720

stuff for the same price which kind of
leads<00:04:18.780> me<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.019> confusion<00:04:19.680> though<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.430> terms<00:04:20.549> of

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
leads me to confusion though in terms of

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.190 
leads me to confusion though in terms of
the<00:04:20.760> pros<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.060> cons<00:04:21.150> we've<00:04:21.570> got<00:04:21.690> absolutely

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
the pros and cons we've got absolutely

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.450 
the pros and cons we've got absolutely
great<00:04:22.349> viewing<00:04:22.590> angles<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.250> fast

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
great viewing angles you have a fast

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.710 
great viewing angles you have a fast
response<00:04:23.610> time<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.270> good<00:04:24.390> for<00:04:24.450> gaming

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
response time so it's good for gaming

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.190 
response time so it's good for gaming
and<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.020> have

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
and you have

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.990 
and you have
good<00:04:25.470> emotive<00:04:25.920> impost<00:04:26.250> another<00:04:26.730> thing<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
good emotive impost another thing is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.430 
good emotive impost another thing is
that<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.150> don't<00:04:27.300> get<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.510> DisplayPort<00:04:28.140> input

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
that you don't get a DisplayPort input

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.030 
that you don't get a DisplayPort input
so<00:04:28.650> for<00:04:28.920> proper<00:04:29.610> PC<00:04:29.820> users<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:31.230> you're<00:04:31.740> not

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
so for proper PC users then you're not

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.530 
so for proper PC users then you're not
quite<00:04:32.340> too<00:04:32.550> happy<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.000> obviously<00:04:33.330> there's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
quite too happy and obviously there's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.440 
quite too happy and obviously there's
not<00:04:33.750> 144<00:04:34.530> Hertz<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.100> standards<00:04:35.790> isn't

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
not 144 Hertz and the standards isn't

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.760 
not 144 Hertz and the standards isn't
the<00:04:36.540> best<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.110> wild<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.410> see<00:04:37.500> how<00:04:37.560> very

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
the best in the wild to see how very

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.460 
the best in the wild to see how very
little<00:04:37.920> adjustment<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:39.210> in<00:04:39.420> terms<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:40.050> if<00:04:40.290> you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
little adjustment but in terms of if you

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.330 
little adjustment but in terms of if you
want<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.400> guess<00:04:42.300> decent<00:04:43.200> monitor<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.220> then

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
want a I guess decent monitor and then

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.100 
want a I guess decent monitor and then
this<00:04:44.640> is<00:04:44.790> definitely<00:04:45.060> one<00:04:45.300> for<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.630> if<00:04:45.990> you

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
this is definitely one for you if you

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.420 
this is definitely one for you if you
like<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.380> look<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.770> or<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.040> just<00:04:47.160> want<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
like the look of it or you just want the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.370 
like the look of it or you just want the
headphones<00:04:47.790> then<00:04:48.030> that's<00:04:48.330> also<00:04:48.570> obviously<00:04:49.260> an

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
headphones then that's also obviously an

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.830 
headphones then that's also obviously an
option<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.550> confusing<00:04:51.150> thing<00:04:51.330> for<00:04:51.510> me<00:04:51.630> is

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
option but the confusing thing for me is

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.630 
option but the confusing thing for me is
that<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.380> isn't<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.040> best<00:04:53.250> budget

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
that this isn't really the best budget

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.240 
that this isn't really the best budget
monster<00:04:54.390> around<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.320> can't<00:04:55.770> really<00:04:55.920> give<00:04:56.130> it

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
monster around so I can't really give it

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.820 
monster around so I can't really give it
any<00:04:56.400> set<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:56.790> budget<00:04:57.030> Buster<00:04:57.540> awards<00:04:57.960> it's

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
any set of budget Buster awards it's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.440 
any set of budget Buster awards it's
good<00:04:59.070> for<00:04:59.220> gamers<00:04:59.400> but<00:04:59.730> personally<00:05:00.180> if<00:05:00.300> you're

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
good for gamers but personally if you're

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.480 
good for gamers but personally if you're
going<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> gaming<00:05:01.500> monitor<00:05:01.890> I<00:05:02.160> check<00:05:02.460> out

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
going for a gaming monitor I check out

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
going for a gaming monitor I check out

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
something like the AOC g20 460 PKU that

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.510 
something like the AOC g20 460 PKU that
we've<00:05:06.630> reviewed<00:05:06.810> or<00:05:07.800> if<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.040> have<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.190> bit<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.430> a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
we've reviewed or if you have a bit of a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.460 
we've reviewed or if you have a bit of a
higher<00:05:08.730> budget<00:05:08.970> than<00:05:09.420> something<00:05:09.810> like<00:05:09.990> Bank

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
higher budget than something like Bank

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.910 
higher budget than something like Bank
use<00:05:10.680> XL<00:05:11.190> 27<00:05:14.240> 2008<00:05:15.240> just<00:05:15.840> it's<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.200> strange<00:05:16.530> point

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
use XL 27 2008 just it's a strange point

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.760 
use XL 27 2008 just it's a strange point
for<00:05:17.220> me<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.490> at<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.480> price<00:05:18.750> point<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:19.200> isn't

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
for me and at that price point it isn't

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.770 
for me and at that price point it isn't
too<00:05:19.950> bad<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.400> terms<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.790> monitors<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.360> general

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
too bad in terms of monitors in general

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.420 
too bad in terms of monitors in general
so<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.020> does<00:05:22.140> have<00:05:22.350> some<00:05:22.380> nice<00:05:22.710> features<00:05:22.770> that

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
so it does have some nice features that

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.540 
so it does have some nice features that
a<00:05:23.640> lot<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.060> other<00:05:24.330> 27<00:05:25.050> inch<00:05:25.170> monitors<00:05:25.620> roughly

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.520 
a lot of other 27 inch monitors roughly
the<00:05:26.700> same<00:05:26.850> price<00:05:27.060> point<00:05:27.180> well<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.960> don't<00:05:28.320> have
