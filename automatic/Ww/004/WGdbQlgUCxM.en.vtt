00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
very good center for just because he's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
know they're not gonna catch him and he

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
know they're not gonna catch him and he
is<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.180> quick<00:01:42.479> cam<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.990> he

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
is just really really quick cam and he

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.480 
is just really really quick cam and he
did<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.470> into<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> attacking

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
did get into a lot of attacking

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
did get into a lot of attacking
positions<00:01:44.939> took<00:01:45.180> over<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> strike<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> lot

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
positions took over the strike as a lot

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
positions took over the strike as a lot
which<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:46.770> times<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> irritating

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
which at times was kind of irritating

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
which at times was kind of irritating
and<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.649> said<00:01:49.829> stop<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> strike

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and because it was said stop the strike

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.219 
and because it was said stop the strike
him<00:01:50.700> score<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> essentially<00:01:51.840> could<00:01:52.049> cost

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
him score and essentially could cost

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
him score and essentially could cost
your<00:01:52.380> games<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.250> he's<00:01:53.369> always<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
your games but he's always there on the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
your games but he's always there on the
