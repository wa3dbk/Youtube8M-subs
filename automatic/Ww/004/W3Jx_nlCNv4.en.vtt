00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.319
 in this and six but I'm from that 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.509
 we are in a such that 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.220
 booty cause is good and better match me 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.080
 I would dare to say in proportion to time 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.310
 casualties and death in the truth none 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.930
 attentive here to the first man who goes 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.299
 kill who is a man or a tree man 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.560
 what the hell that people do as the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.029
 truth is that in this game I felt 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.359
 pretty sure at first you're going to see 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.320
 I'm a little bit more paradito like 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.119
 accommodating me to the game as well 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.130
 say it and then you will see walking of 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.109
 My mother's departure started to fight 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.819
 an amazing way and I start to kill 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.920
 to everyone until you reach the point of 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.380
 take out three three people helicopter 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.910
 helicopters and well then in this 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.170
 I wanted to take advantage of her for 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.460
 show you the class I was wearing 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.650
 just under the description you are going to 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.120
 have a a link is worth an image of 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.560
 the class just the one I was wearing 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.670
 If someone wants to copy it and try it 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.460
 because the truth that I'm going to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.690
 wonder and we can start with the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.880
 main weapon for those who increase a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.550
 little the class because there is in the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.470
 category of advantages I'm making a 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.420
 sort of combination which I think 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.560
 knows few people and is going super 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.240
 well as in late I think I have it 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.800
 put in all the classes then 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.420
 Well, the first thing I wanted to talk about was 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.280
 little bit of this weapon that is pretty 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 little used by people is more me 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.290
 I think not 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.640
 on youtube for not saying anything with 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.650
 this truth 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 and how it was beginning to affect the whole 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.700
 World mine to mine s mother and the truth is 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 that is a crazy kid do not let me 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.510
 redder than red olives though 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.950
 do not exist and then you see that it is more good and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.350
 the drop shott that the study is that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.270
 Attentive James here again looks at you 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.010
 shot to look like a touch not if you 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.930
 shot assists but in the end they give me 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.220
 the low I do not understand why they gave me the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.810
 helicopter with an assistance not what 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.130
 I understood the truth and well let's say 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.510
 that we are carrying with the weapon is that 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.220
 sometimes called by rené lasquetty a 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.480
 pretty funny man and wore it 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.980
 with silencer and grip and you go to 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.540
 see that in the middle of the game has 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.850
 Kill Miss is with hair 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 Redhead and good, well, you are going to see that 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 mediated gameplay long shot 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.580
 distance and in a submachine gun and the truth 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.160
 is that even a long submachine gun 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.900
 distance goes perfect or is with 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.010
 grip and silencer is that it does not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.560
 they move people but from a 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.740
 inconvenience kill costs quite kill 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.000
 pöcking kill of enough bullets but 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.320
 as I said it does not move anything has 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 Assault rifle function 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.920
 of fuse true then good as 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.810
 grip as said moves less 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.400
 still so it goes super well after 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.200
 he wore 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 the only grenade that carried the package 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.549
 improvised that as you know people 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.260
 he eats it a lot and I know how 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.340
 dodge the improvised package the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.379
 it's really good to get a 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 low always comes in handy later in 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.049
 the people selling section where I wanted 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.489
 get good 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.430
 the advantages that will least matter 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 about the scavenger on the hard line and the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.879
 protective shield that you already know for what 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.349
 which serves each one are pretty advantages 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.540
 Usual gamers call of duty 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.060
 and then it had two advantages 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.980
 keys the advantage of amplifying and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.470
 Deadly silence advantage the residence 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.260
 mortal as you know makes your steps 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.060
 do not sound and other than that people do not 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 listen to your steps there is one thing that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.829
 very much like this advantage and is that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.450
 you do not get confused when listening to your steps 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.370
 and believe that they are steps of another person 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.810
 that this really happens to me very many 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.180
 Sometimes it does not happen that you are playing a 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.099
 departure and you are walking and your 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.269
 steps you think is the step of a 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.250
 enemy and you start to look for another 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.689
 side because to vice bo cut then by 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.010
 the truth that this advantage I put it 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.720
 more than anything because I do not 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.920
 I listen to my own steps and when 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.170
 I heard some control step public me to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.030
 an enemy that I have near where after 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.500
 we have the advantage of amplifying that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.080
 makes us listen to the steps of the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.970
 much more enemies 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.560
 and apart from the enemies that carry 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.780
 deadly silence also what 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.950
 we hear is something that is exaggerated or 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.320
 it is like a kind of v sat 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.660
 orbiting the white 2 constant but more 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.940
 what a visual to say when seeing it in the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.730
 same admits in the mini map more than 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.560
 visual is more auditory because we listen 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.600
 the steps to 200 kilometers I say true 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.910
 then lad line blade that 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.050
 epicidad do not put the turret in the middle 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.970
 of the smoke because if the end of the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.990
 departure and good people because what they believe is what 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.270
 what I wanted to comment has made me 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.160
 try the advantages of amplifying and 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.110
 of deadly selection because they go phenomenal 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.580
 to listen to the enemies and good ya 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.560
 after the streak the jump took the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.570
 s the turret and the helicopter 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.130
 combat and the truth is that instead of 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.290
 combat helicopters should I the 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.850
 bull touré that is the species 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.980
 of drone this chasing you from behind 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.300
 and it's covering your back then 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.470
 good people number time comment more 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.180
 as you have seen the super game 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.490
 fast and super dynamic and more than line 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.080
 that of people who killed 31 who pulls me out is 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.459
 here three combat helicopters and 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.290
 my mother and we see the last descent of 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.220
 doggie this additionally I hope so 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.900
 that you liked, we can for the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.340
 comments I like this game and if 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.750
 you want more types of games like this 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.040
 so nothing the former worker did 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.540
 subscribe if it is not 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.540
 and see you next time bye
