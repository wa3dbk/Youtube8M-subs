my<00:05:00.730> put<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.870> on<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.290> then<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.470> have<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:03.060> friend

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
my put it on and then I have a friend

my put it on and then I have a friend
stop<00:05:04.480> work<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.050> will<00:05:05.200> go<00:05:05.350> on<00:05:05.670> tight<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.910> that

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
stop work that will go on tight to that

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.370 
stop work that will go on tight to that
and<00:05:07.960> then<00:05:08.170> I<00:05:08.470> can<00:05:09.130> clamp<00:05:12.690> this<00:05:13.690> side<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.260> that

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
and then I can clamp this side and that

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.290 
and then I can clamp this side and that
side<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.800> then<00:05:14.890> pull<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.250> out<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.880> my<00:05:16.060> crown

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
side and then pull this out and my crown

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.330 
side and then pull this out and my crown
molding<00:05:16.720> will<00:05:16.870> then<00:05:16.990> slide<00:05:17.260> in<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.830> we<00:05:18.250> have

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
molding will then slide in and we have

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.160 
molding will then slide in and we have
the<00:05:18.430> perfect<00:05:18.610> spring<00:05:18.970> angle<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.900> don't<00:05:20.080> have

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
the perfect spring angle so I don't have

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.690 
the perfect spring angle so I don't have
to<00:05:20.260> worry<00:05:20.410> about<00:05:20.470> rolling<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.040> in<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.190> box<00:05:21.490> and

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
to worry about rolling it in the box and

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.370 
to worry about rolling it in the box and
getting<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.090> right<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.300> know<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.600> put<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.110> and

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
getting it right I know I put it in and

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.890 
getting it right I know I put it in and
it's<00:05:23.530> right<00:05:23.770> axes<00:05:24.190> focus<00:05:24.580> on<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:25.360> actual<00:05:25.630> cut

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
it's right axes focus on the actual cut

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.260 
it's right axes focus on the actual cut
and<00:05:26.140> length<00:05:26.320> of<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.530> cut<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.760> now<00:05:27.790> it's<00:05:28.060> time

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
and length of the cut so now it's time

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.360 
and length of the cut so now it's time
to<00:05:28.420> install<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.780> roomful<00:05:29.200> of<00:05:29.260> crown<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.250> you're

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
to install a roomful of crown so you're

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.640

Collins<00:06:09.310> talks<00:06:10.270> about<00:06:10.600> or<00:06:10.810> provides<00:06:11.530> designs

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
Collins talks about or provides designs

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.260 
Collins talks about or provides designs
for<00:06:12.400> a<00:06:12.780> fixture<00:06:13.780> that<00:06:14.140> you<00:06:14.980> that<00:06:15.400> you<00:06:15.580> nest<00:06:15.910> the

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
for a fixture that you that you nest the

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.909 
for a fixture that you that you nest the
crown<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.169> that<00:06:17.290> keeps<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.590> at<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.800> right

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
crown and that keeps it at the right

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.620 
crown and that keeps it at the right
angle<00:06:17.980> so<00:06:18.370> when<00:06:18.520> you're<00:06:18.640> doing<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:18.940> cope<00:06:19.180> it's

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
angle so when you're doing the cope it's

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.260 
angle so when you're doing the cope it's
easy<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:20.020> fall<00:06:20.230> I<00:06:20.560> have<00:06:20.980> that<00:06:21.220> fixture<00:06:21.640> and<00:06:21.880> the

in and I'm not taking 16-foot Goods and

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.040 
in and I'm not taking 16-foot Goods and
try<00:06:42.250> to<00:06:42.310> move<00:06:42.610> them<00:06:42.760> around<00:06:42.880> so<00:06:43.300> again<00:06:43.900> that's

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
try to move them around so again that's

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.620 
try to move them around so again that's
just<00:06:44.290> a<00:06:44.410> point<00:06:44.680> out<00:06:44.860> that<00:06:45.130> don't<00:06:45.730> overlook<00:06:46.330> the

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
just a point out that don't overlook the

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.550 
just a point out that don't overlook the
sawhorses<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:47.770> think<00:06:48.100> again<00:06:48.490> they<00:06:48.670> are<00:06:49.260> in<00:06:50.260> my

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
sawhorses I think again they are in my

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.000 
sawhorses I think again they are in my
work<00:06:50.890> flow<00:06:51.730> they<00:06:52.390> are<00:06:52.660> the<00:06:53.260> most<00:06:53.500> important

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
work flow they are the most important

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.850 
work flow they are the most important
part<00:06:54.250> of<00:06:54.400> any<00:06:54.940> miter<00:06:55.240> saw<00:06:55.480> stand<00:06:55.810> stop<00:06:56.590> the

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
part of any miter saw stand stop the

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.010 
part of any miter saw stand stop the
material<00:06:57.400> at<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.910> saw<00:06:58.150> so<00:06:58.540> you're<00:06:58.660> not<00:06:58.810> moving

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
material at the saw so you're not moving
