00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
when they rise because they'll not only

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.090 
when they rise because they'll not only
rise<00:02:21.920> upward<00:02:22.430> they'll<00:02:22.670> also<00:02:23.470> go<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> join<00:02:24.890> each

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
rise upward they'll also go to join each

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.030 
rise upward they'll also go to join each
other<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.480> room<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.680> want

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
other if they have the room so you want

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
to give them some room see what a nice

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.300 
to give them some room see what a nice
pinwheel<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.500> makes<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> middle<00:02:34.250> of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
pinwheel that makes in the middle of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.420 
pinwheel that makes in the middle of
with<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.580> filling<00:02:35.120> really<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> nice<00:02:39.430> and

then we're just going to put one big one

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.140 
then we're just going to put one big one
in<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.330> middle<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.170> now<00:02:45.980> I'm<00:02:46.370> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.850> take

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
they have risen we're going to put them

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.270 
they have risen we're going to put them
in<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.000> oven<00:03:56.150> now<00:03:56.390> at<00:03:56.570> 375<00:03:57.440> we're<00:03:58.100> going<00:03:58.220> to

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
in the oven now at 375 we're going to

cook them about 20 minutes but I'm going

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.229 
cook them about 20 minutes but I'm going
to<00:04:00.200> keep<00:04:00.350> checking<00:04:00.709> them<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.190> I'm<00:04:01.579> also<00:04:01.820> going

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
to keep checking them and I'm also going

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.000 
to keep checking them and I'm also going
to<00:04:02.329> put<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.690> temperature<00:04:03.290> probe<00:04:03.590> in<00:04:03.769> there

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
to put a temperature probe in there

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.830 
to put a temperature probe in there
because<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.700> want<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> finished<00:04:05.360> temperature

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
because I want the finished temperature

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.340 
because I want the finished temperature
to<00:04:05.989> be<00:04:06.140> about<00:04:06.410> 185<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.519> 190<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.930> can't<00:04:09.199> always

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
to be about 185 to 190 you can't always

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.980 
to be about 185 to 190 you can't always
tell<00:04:09.709> by<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.949> look<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.370> bun<00:04:10.609> so<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
tell by the look of a bun so the

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.650 
tell by the look of a bun so the
temperature<00:04:12.530> probe<00:04:12.770> is<00:04:12.890> very<00:04:13.100> good<00:04:13.310> for<00:04:13.490> that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
temperature probe is very good for that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.660 
temperature probe is very good for that
well<00:04:14.660> we've<00:04:14.780> taken<00:04:14.960> our<00:04:15.350> crumb<00:04:15.650> buns<00:04:15.920> out<00:04:16.250> and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
well we've taken our crumb buns out and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.020 
well we've taken our crumb buns out and
as<00:04:16.790> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:17.090> see<00:04:17.150> they've<00:04:17.660> really<00:04:17.960> risen<00:04:18.350> and

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
as you can see they've really risen and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.370 
as you can see they've really risen and
they<00:04:20.030> come<00:04:20.300> around<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:20.720> crumbs<00:04:22.870> I'm<00:04:23.870> going<00:04:24.290> to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
they come around the crumbs I'm going to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.280 
they come around the crumbs I'm going to
let<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.710> cool<00:04:24.950> for<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.340> little<00:04:25.400> bit<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.290> then

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
let that cool for a little bit and then

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.170 
let that cool for a little bit and then
I'm<00:04:27.410> going<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.740> dust<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.340> generously<00:04:28.820> with

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
I'm going to dust it generously with

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.750 
I'm going to dust it generously with
confectioner<00:04:30.170> sugar<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.190> find<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.550> for

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
confectioner sugar and I find that for

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.880 
confectioner sugar and I find that for
the<00:04:31.850> most<00:04:31.880> part<00:04:32.300> it's<00:04:32.510> really<00:04:32.900> easier<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.710> to

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
the most part it's really easier just to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.180 
the most part it's really easier just to
cut<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.100> crumb<00:04:34.430> buns<00:04:34.670> out<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.320> out<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190
