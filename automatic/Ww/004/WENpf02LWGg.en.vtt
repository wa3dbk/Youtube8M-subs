00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
modules these modules are designed so

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.950 
modules these modules are designed so
that<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.610> added<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.180> removed<00:00:24.240> from

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that they can be added or removed from

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.740 
that they can be added or removed from
slots<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.950> computer's<00:00:26.430> motherboard

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
slots on the computer's motherboard

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
slots on the computer's motherboard
there<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.930> two<00:00:28.200> common<00:00:28.560> module<00:00:29.130> types<00:00:29.599> dims

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there are two common module types dims

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.970 
there are two common module types dims
and<00:00:31.079> so<00:00:31.919> dims<00:00:32.600> dim<00:00:33.600> stands<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.260> dual<00:00:34.469> inline

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and so dims dim stands for dual inline

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.049 
and so dims dim stands for dual inline
memory<00:00:35.040> modules<00:00:35.910> di<00:00:36.890> MMS<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.760> primarily

used<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.960> desktop<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> slimline<00:00:41.399> computers

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
used in desktop and slimline computers

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.200 
used in desktop and slimline computers
so<00:00:43.020> dims<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.559> smaller<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.640> used<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so dims are smaller and are used in

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.500 
so dims are smaller and are used in
notebook<00:00:45.660> PCs<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.530> all-in-one<00:00:47.370> desktop<00:00:47.999> PCs
