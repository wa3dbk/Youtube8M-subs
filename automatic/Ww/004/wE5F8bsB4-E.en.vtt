00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:17.390
 the delmano roll let's talk what a rapidion 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.610
 of enterobacteria that are bacteria that 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 typically colonize the region of the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.550
 gastrointestinal tract 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.510
 let's start with the features 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.990
 of them are gram-negative in general 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.100
 are facultative anaerobes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.170
 they can inhabit only vegetation. 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.450
 capture water and lives mainly 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.400
 gastrointestinal tract 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.430
 some bacteria as we will see 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.930
 along the video are pathogenic other 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.460
 they are not just monthly batteries there 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.020
 beginning here by classifying the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 enterobacteria such as people 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 ranks an enterobacterium people go 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.020
 default here are three types of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.730
 antigens to classify them 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.369
 You can classify them tells a 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.939
 group against a bore group or against a 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.429
 serotype is more specific is this 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.299
 she also counts the 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:17.210
 somatic antigen on the recent fast 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.249
 Somatic responded by are sugar side 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.439
 of bacteria lps 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:24.619
 the car corresponded to the antigen 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.869
 capsular and at h corresponds to the antigen 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.899
 flagellate to the sound of the group by 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.649
 For example, we have a group dream . 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.389
 othon do not know 16 serotypes is how it is more 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.939
 specific we have a serotype for 

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:43.369
 example 137 h 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.529
 9 and why do you have this kind of 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.599
 classification against serotype serotype 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:50.409
 because there are some bacteria that are 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:54.049
 Pathogenic others are not pathogenic 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.009
 depends on these capsular antigens i quit 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.289
 for example there are several species 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.929
 there are several types of escher and 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.969
 host pathogenic incentives there is a 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.919
 kind are pathogenic and how do we 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.319
 will differentiate them we will use 

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:14.620
 this classification to differentiate them 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.280
 beginning here with salmonella at 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.500
 salmonella causes 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
 several diseases there is not human you already 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.760
 must have heard of it there that 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.120
 egg bacterium right there 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.860
 the main species of salmonella that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.430
 It matters to us here the salmonella 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.100
 enteric but you have several species there 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.440
 but the main one that affects the being 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.760
 human is basically from here to salmonella 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 Enteric enteric sub-species it can 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.920
 cause here basically two diseases it 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.970
 can cause a gastro-enteritis that comes 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.370
 accompanied by diarrhea and it is all 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.989
 gastrointestinal symptoms and she also 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.600
 can cause typhoid fever 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.970
 specifically the tiff subtype of the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.819
 Salmonella Salmonella Subtypes or Serotype 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:13.250
 tiff typhoid fever 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.680
 the reservoir of this bacterium are 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.560
 animals, whether domestic or 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.540
 wild form of transmission as already 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.610
 I spoke and ingested food 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.620
 contaminated in the afternoon in birds 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.410
 it may be present or you can 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.900
 very well, contact this 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.180
 bacteria after handling some of the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.870
 thing or carry the hand in the mouth account 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 contaminate another person and thus 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.660
 another bacterium or bacteria is believed to 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.910
 or x it depends on how you talk to 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.000
 that the main species of 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.079
 they are boy and they are ney flex nery boyd 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.820
 dysentery 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.489
 We 're going to talk a little about the 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.269
 dysentery then good to inhabit it 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.579
 can live in the intestines of humans but 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.690
 can also inhabit the gut of other 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.970
 primates 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.920
 their transmission similar to that of 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.340
 salmonella have direct food contact 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.340
 Contaminated water is also important 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.579
 here is the mechanism of her violence is 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.299
 invasion as she does she kind of gets 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:23.030
 strolling through the center O ments attack the 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:26.470
 I quote here the bacteria alone 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.479
 will enter the inter- as itu happens that she 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.990
 encompassed fagundes or somalia escapes 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.260
 of this 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.150
 then it enters the macrophage that is 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.130
 Wandering around there 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.490
 She goes in and leaves him and goes to 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.730
 another inter or if she stays there 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.830
 that our beautiful in inter face and is 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.080
 is walking in and out here O 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.770
 who is hanging around by the inter 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.310
 It is then she causes injuries to the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.320
 epithelium so that you have a 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.900
 picture frame looks here is very 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:09.110
 important we put of red is the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:16.300
 picture of dysentery that you will have in 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:19.150
 blood in the stool making the stool 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.410
 in the stool 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.690
 another important thing here about 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.270
 to reach it is that the species that I 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.720
 I said I think she's saying I'm type 1 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.740
 it produces a special protein a 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.290
 important toxin to xinga toxin that 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.600
 this toxin does it cause damage there 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.870
 both the intestinal epithelium and the 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.990
 Goal renal number and it does so because 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:51.470
 a characteristic syndrome called 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:53.030
 hemolytic uremic syndrome and the last 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.300
 of the enterobacteria that we are going to 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.710
 talking about this video here is yersinia a 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.830
 people will basically talk about two 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.460
 species that the yersin a plague and niches 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:10.520
 Enterocolitis cuca a yersinia pestes is a 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:16.490
 the cause of the famous bubonic plague plague 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:20.450
 bubonic is there yes there are pieces she presents 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.640
 there in rats and fleas and how the shape 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.130
 of transmission of you the human being 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.140
 Tallin in contact with it in contact with 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.890
 excrement goes and gets it gives 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.110
 after infection with the bacterium 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:40.190
 colonized there goes through the vessels 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.200
 lymphatic vessels of empathic vessels 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.700
 in circulation in the bloodstream 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:54.810
 from it it can spread and can cause 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:57.030
 sets and mia or she can go to the lungs and 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.900
 they are disposed of by aerosols and 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:05.160
 contaminate other human beings it is 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:07.050
 well lethal since yersinia enterocolite is 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.630
 it will cause what the name itself 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.350
 says she will cause an enterocolitis he 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.570
 very similar to that of the slipper 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:19.080
 characterized by dysentery or 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.480
 diarrhea may also have blood because 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.750
 it proliferates on the lamina propria of 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.870
 intestinal epithelium that causes inflammation 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.480
 she eventually causes mechanical injury 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.960
 also can and pass the clean informed them 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:39.350
 of the month in tério and dalila with this cause 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:42.680
 an inflammation and gives a similar picture 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.680
 to appendicitis 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:52.470
 Another thing to remember is that yersinia is 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.230
 a must pathogen ie is evil 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:59.720
 even so she's not just the little friend there 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.720
 just qatar 

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.890
 Good guys this is what I had for 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.440
 enterobacteria from the first 

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:10.740
 part at least in the second part speak 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.330
 about this wanted host and this is it 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.470
 I hope you have enjoyed the video of 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.470
 jewelery and was worth the spot
