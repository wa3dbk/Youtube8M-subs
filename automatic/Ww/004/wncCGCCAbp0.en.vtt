00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 other contemporaries are five 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.149
 stories I would like to live without 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.829
 stories that believe how 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.000
 so come on 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 the first historic alpha hectare in this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 list is this secret city of the bullseye 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.010
 Ask the source, I really wanted to live. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.129

 which involves this meeting and summons 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.170
 so I sure would like to live 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 in the secret society book this is the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 raulzito but four books and japan 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.490
 especially a special video about them 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.890
 skating sport rules like this 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.350
 well confused no one sees and tries the law 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 so it does not get very confusing but they are 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 a sport so it is within one of 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 a block what do you have to play 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.979
 and there are dear ones to meet just seeing 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.630
 even looked for the anthem on youtube or 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 thing in this market 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.369

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.569
 I really wanted to live in this world where 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.000
 it is in texas that they are well off 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.290
 even want to go back to roller skating 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.150
 anyway you must have that bad cause I would 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.700
 seeing the obvious that would also give our 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.459
 list harry potter won the first 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.380

 fourth defeat dropped arriving in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.920
 home I hope until today 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.989

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.819

 Quad god, how 's football playing? 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:51.269

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.959
 I also chose ally spy schools 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.180
 crankcase 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.370

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.209
 brutal and the beginning dealt with training 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.489
 to enter the gym etc 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.310
 here is not a girls' school here 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.950
 who were hoping that the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.079
 that the schools courses are very good and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 missions and such I would very much like 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.739
 avoid participating in a school of 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530

 God is going to the camp and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.549

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.409

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.919
