00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
some ideas on some of the things that we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.020 
some ideas on some of the things that we
try<00:00:59.960> and<00:00:59.989> do<00:01:00.289> here<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.370> give<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:01.730> better

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
what we're we're trying to achieve in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.050 
what we're we're trying to achieve in
terms<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.530> realism<00:01:06.979> because<00:01:07.250> there's<00:01:07.580> all

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
terms of realism because there's all

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.480 
terms of realism because there's all
kinds<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.690> levels<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.229> realism<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.280> can

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
kinds of levels of realism that you can

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.270 
kinds of levels of realism that you can
achieve<00:01:10.610> there's<00:01:11.119> always<00:01:11.270> another<00:01:11.720> level<00:01:12.280> so

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
achieve there's always another level so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.450 
achieve there's always another level so
that<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.729> are<00:01:14.119> trying<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.570> keep<00:01:15.170> peeling<00:01:16.160> away

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
that we are trying to keep peeling away

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.000 
that we are trying to keep peeling away
the<00:01:16.610> layers<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.539> creating<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.380> better<00:01:18.799> and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
the layers and creating a better and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.370 
the layers and creating a better and
better<00:01:19.159> realism<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:20.390> give<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.780> more<00:01:21.229> and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
better realism to give you a more and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.940 
better realism to give you a more and
more<00:01:21.470> successful<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.490> convincing<00:01:22.820> prosthesis

more successful in convincing prosthesis

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.160 
more successful in convincing prosthesis
we've<00:01:24.950> got<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> below<00:01:25.670> elbow<00:01:26.000> prosthesis<00:01:26.570> here

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
we've got a below elbow prosthesis here

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.429 
we've got a below elbow prosthesis here
this<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.950> actually<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.460> passive<00:01:29.119> arm<00:01:29.360> I'm<00:01:30.259> not

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
this is actually a passive arm I'm not

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.260 
this is actually a passive arm I'm not

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
things about this though why I've got

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.330 
things about this though why I've got
this<00:01:49.909> hand<00:01:50.210> here<00:01:50.689> if<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.590> can<00:01:51.770> get<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.040> close<00:01:52.310> up

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
this hand here if we can get it close up

this hand here if we can get it close up
what<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:52.820> can<00:01:53.060> show<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:54.680> one<00:01:55.009> is

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
what I can show you is that this one is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.940 
what I can show you is that this one is
a<00:01:55.310> hand<00:01:55.790> sculpted<00:01:56.060> prosthesis<00:01:56.810> which<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.710> some

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
a hand sculpted prosthesis which in some

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.550 
a hand sculpted prosthesis which in some
cases<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.700> best<00:01:58.939> way<00:01:59.149> to<00:01:59.180> go<00:01:59.509> depending<00:02:00.439> on

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
cases is the best way to go depending on

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.139 
cases is the best way to go depending on
what<00:02:00.770> you're<00:02:00.979> trying<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.520> achieve<00:02:01.610> because

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
what you're trying to achieve because

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.870 
what you're trying to achieve because
I've<00:02:02.299> actually<00:02:02.450> got<00:02:02.720> hand<00:02:03.560> sculpted<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.340> what

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
I've actually got hand sculpted and what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.350 
I've actually got hand sculpted and what
I<00:02:04.909> call<00:02:05.649> lifecasts<00:02:06.649> people<00:02:07.460> think<00:02:07.670> lifecasts

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
I call lifecasts people think lifecasts

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.030 
I call lifecasts people think lifecasts
are<00:02:08.450> cheating<00:02:08.959> but<00:02:09.290> really<00:02:09.829> they're<00:02:10.009> not

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
are cheating but really they're not

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.740 
are cheating but really they're not
necessarily<00:02:10.640> cheating<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.299> just<00:02:11.480> another

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
necessarily cheating it's just another

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.940 
necessarily cheating it's just another
solution<00:02:12.430> there's<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.720> problem<00:02:14.769> again<00:02:15.769> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
solution there's a problem again the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.759 
solution there's a problem again the
hand<00:02:16.190> sculpting<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:18.049> going<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> give<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.739> a

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
hand sculpting is going to give you a

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.710 
hand sculpting is going to give you a
certain<00:02:19.190> level<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.670> realism<00:02:19.940> but<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.540> gives

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
certain level of realism but it gives

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
certain level of realism but it gives
you<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> lot<00:02:21.079> more<00:02:21.290> power<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.829> control<00:02:22.280> over

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you a lot more power and control over

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.979 
you a lot more power and control over
the<00:02:22.700> shape<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> design<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.870> know

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
the shape and the design you know

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.370 
the shape and the design you know
there's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
there's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.260 
there's
sometimes<00:02:24.770> where<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.520> shape<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> design

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
sometimes where the shape of the design

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.020 
sometimes where the shape of the design
is<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.720> important<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.700> want

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
is really important and you don't want

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.140 
is really important and you don't want
to<00:02:29.150> sacrifice<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.170> function<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.550> want<00:02:32.060> to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to sacrifice the function or you want to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.880 
to sacrifice the function or you want to
have<00:02:32.480> something<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.140> accommodate<00:02:33.500> an

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
have something that can accommodate an

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.620 
have something that can accommodate an
unusual<00:02:34.550> shape<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.120> can't<00:02:35.390> always

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
unusual shape and you can't always

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.440 
unusual shape and you can't always
achieve<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.740> with<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> life<00:02:37.220> cast<00:02:37.520> this<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
achieve that with a life cast this is a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.900 
achieve that with a life cast this is a
life<00:02:38.750> cast<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.620> which<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.370> nice<00:02:40.610> because

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
life cast here which is nice because

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.660 
life cast here which is nice because
then<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.420> creates<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.990> more<00:02:42.440> realistic<00:02:42.860> surface

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
then it creates a more realistic surface

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.790 
then it creates a more realistic surface
texture<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.570> details

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
texture and details

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.270 
texture and details
it<00:02:46.250> even<00:02:46.490> has<00:02:46.670> fingerprints<00:02:47.620> all<00:02:48.620> these<00:02:49.010> have

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
it even has fingerprints all these have

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.240 
it even has fingerprints all these have
custom<00:02:49.760> nails<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.660> match<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:51.080> patient<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.040> we

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
custom nails to match a patient so we

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.830 
custom nails to match a patient so we
can<00:02:52.430> put<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.730> an<00:02:52.880> extraordinary<00:02:53.300> amount<00:02:53.660> of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
can put in an extraordinary amount of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.950 
can put in an extraordinary amount of
detail<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:55.940> actually<00:02:56.420> an<00:02:56.540> older

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
detail on it this is actually an older

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.160 
detail on it this is actually an older
demo<00:02:57.410> too<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.360> externally

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
demo too so that this is all externally

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.410 
demo too so that this is all externally
painted<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.070> where<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.880> nice<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.390> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
painted and where this is nice is that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.040 
painted and where this is nice is that
this<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.370> early<00:03:04.370> days<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.630> do<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> lot

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
this is in early days and we do a lot

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.570 
this is in early days and we do a lot
more<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.530> now<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.920> I'll<00:03:07.040> talk<00:03:07.280> more<00:03:07.520> about

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
more of it now and I'll talk more about

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.810 
more of it now and I'll talk more about
it<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.240> internally<00:03:09.020> colored<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.250> every

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
it is internally colored so that every

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.270 
it is internally colored so that every
detail<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.810> actually<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.710> how<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.950> part

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
detail on this actually is how the part

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.400 
detail on this actually is how the part
came<00:03:13.490> out<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> mold<00:03:14.090> I've<00:03:14.780> done<00:03:15.110> no

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
came out of the mold I've done no

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.800 
came out of the mold I've done no
painting<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.190> no<00:03:16.700> surface<00:03:17.240> coloring

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
painting and no surface coloring

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.440 
painting and no surface coloring
whatsoever<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.160> yet<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.030> shows<00:03:20.270> you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
whatsoever to this yet so it shows you

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.590 
whatsoever to this yet so it shows you
just<00:03:20.480> how<00:03:20.810> much<00:03:21.350> detail<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:23.000> create<00:03:23.360> in

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
just how much detail you can create in

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.150 
just how much detail you can create in
your<00:03:23.720> piece<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.260> we're<00:03:24.410> always<00:03:24.500> pushing<00:03:24.860> that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
your piece and we're always pushing that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.880 
your piece and we're always pushing that
technology<00:03:25.850> farther<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.540> farther<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:27.230> create

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
technology farther and farther to create

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.980 
technology farther and farther to create
higher<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.310> higher<00:03:28.460> levels<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.090> realism<00:03:29.630> in

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
higher and higher levels of realism in

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.100 
higher and higher levels of realism in
this<00:03:30.260> partial<00:03:30.770> hand<00:03:31.070> here<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:32.210> is<00:03:32.450> one<00:03:32.750> as<00:03:32.930> it

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
this partial hand here this is one as it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.480 
this partial hand here this is one as it
came<00:03:33.320> out<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> mold<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.070> they<00:03:34.220> haven't

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
came out of the mold that they haven't

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.910 
came out of the mold that they haven't
done<00:03:34.580> any<00:03:34.850> final<00:03:35.120> painting<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.920> actually

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
done any final painting on it actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.820 
done any final painting on it actually
this<00:03:37.130> one<00:03:37.460> was<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:37.820> discard<00:03:38.480> because<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.620> had

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
this one was a discard because we had

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.490 
this one was a discard because we had
some<00:03:40.040> things<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.400> weren't<00:03:40.730> happy<00:03:40.970> with<00:03:41.500> but

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
some things we weren't happy with but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.650 
some things we weren't happy with but
with<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.250> ethnic<00:03:43.640> patient<00:03:44.090> all<00:03:44.270> these

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
with this ethnic patient all these

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.260 
with this ethnic patient all these
variations<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.620> see<00:03:46.070> here<00:03:46.490> all<00:03:47.210> of

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
variations that you see here all of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.110 
variations that you see here all of
those<00:03:47.780> things<00:03:48.200> this<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.160> how<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.460> came<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.970> of

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
those things this is how it came out of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.390 
those things this is how it came out of
the<00:03:50.180> mold<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> hand<00:03:51.740> carved<00:03:52.160> piece

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the mold this is a hand carved piece

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.690 
the mold this is a hand carved piece
because<00:03:52.850> he<00:03:53.000> had<00:03:53.270> an<00:03:53.480> unusual<00:03:53.650> shape<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.310> work

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
because he had an unusual shape so work

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.050 
because he had an unusual shape so work
better<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.600> try<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.230> do<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.740> by<00:03:57.950> hand<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.910> get

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
better to try and do this by hand to get

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.280 
better to try and do this by hand to get
a<00:03:59.120> desired<00:03:59.630> result

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
a desired result

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.080 
a desired result
because<00:04:00.860> colors<00:04:01.220> really<00:04:01.490> at<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.820> end<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.030> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
because colors really at the end of the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.490 
because colors really at the end of the
day<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.390> most<00:04:02.540> important<00:04:03.110> thing<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:03.410> that's

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
day the most important thing and that's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.199 
day the most important thing and that's
why<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:03.890> push<00:04:04.190> things<00:04:04.430> like<00:04:04.730> internal

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
why we push things like internal

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.480 
why we push things like internal
coloration<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.110> getting<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.920> good<00:04:07.190> match

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
coloration and getting a good match

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.660 
coloration and getting a good match
because<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:08.240> kind<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.630> camouflage<00:04:09.670> you

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
because it's kind of like camouflage you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.280 
because it's kind of like camouflage you
take<00:04:10.940> your<00:04:11.090> tank<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.750> sits<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.230> middle

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
take your tank and it sits in the middle

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.020 
take your tank and it sits in the middle
of<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> woods<00:04:12.830> it's<00:04:13.040> an<00:04:13.190> odd<00:04:13.310> shape<00:04:13.340> but<00:04:13.940> if

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
of the woods it's an odd shape but if

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.090 
of the woods it's an odd shape but if
it's<00:04:14.209> camouflage<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.110> helps<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.680> hide<00:04:15.920> it

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
it's camouflage it helps you to hide it

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.670 
it's camouflage it helps you to hide it
take<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.820> tree<00:04:17.270> that's<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.660> natural<00:04:17.900> shape<00:04:18.410> you

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
take a tree that's a natural shape you

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.220 
take a tree that's a natural shape you
can<00:04:18.739> paint<00:04:19.040> it<00:04:19.160> fluorescent<00:04:19.760> pink<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.840> stands

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
can paint it fluorescent pink it stands

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.130 
can paint it fluorescent pink it stands
out<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:22.150> doesn't<00:04:23.150> doesn't<00:04:23.600> look<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.990> it

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
out and doesn't doesn't look like it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.990 
out and doesn't doesn't look like it
belongs<00:04:24.500> there<00:04:24.680> at<00:04:24.920> all<00:04:25.070> it's<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.760> correct

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
belongs there at all it's a correct

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.430 
belongs there at all it's a correct
shape<00:04:26.360> wrong<00:04:26.990> color

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
shape wrong color

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.070 
shape wrong color
so<00:04:28.010> hopefully<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.780> illustrates<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
so hopefully that illustrates the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.409 
so hopefully that illustrates the
importance<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.860> color<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.520> why<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:32.210> emphasize

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
importance of color and why we emphasize

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.409 
importance of color and why we emphasize
color<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.320> way<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:33.890> now<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.940> another

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
color the way we do now this is another

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.190 
color the way we do now this is another
unusual<00:04:35.990> shape<00:04:36.470> for

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
unusual shape for

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.290 
unusual shape for
martial<00:04:37.500> hands<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.160> what<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.580> see<00:04:39.060> for

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
martial hands so that what you see for

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.630 
martial hands so that what you see for
fingers<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.710> was<00:04:40.920> missing<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.610> we

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
fingers is what was missing so we

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.120 
fingers is what was missing so we
recreate<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.290> this<00:04:43.380> case<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:43.860> were

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
recreate this now in this case we were

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.880 
recreate this now in this case we were
able<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.460> use<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.790> life<00:04:45.120> cast<00:04:45.450> successfully<00:04:46.350> to

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
able to use a life cast successfully to

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.460 
able to use a life cast successfully to
create<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.670> higher<00:04:48.120> degree<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.720> realism<00:04:49.760> with<00:04:50.760> a

finger prosthesis or digital prosthesis
that's<00:04:55.860> that's<00:04:56.520> our<00:04:56.700> fancy<00:04:57.120> word<00:04:57.360> for<00:04:57.390> fingers

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
that's that's our fancy word for fingers

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.670 
that's that's our fancy word for fingers
in<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.500> medical<00:04:58.950> realm<00:04:59.960> there's<00:05:00.960> an<00:05:01.170> example

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
in the medical realm there's an example

restorations when you've got lengths
like<00:05:11.670> this<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.660> can<00:05:12.870> usually<00:05:13.320> create<00:05:13.650> a

you've got no length and that's just the

absent it's about as frustrating and

probably<00:05:23.220> can<00:05:23.790> create<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.630> got<00:05:25.290> this<00:05:25.530> one<00:05:25.800> here

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
probably can create I got this one here

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.850 
probably can create I got this one here
I<00:05:26.550> know<00:05:26.610> it's<00:05:26.850> another<00:05:27.120> thumb<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:28.350> again<00:05:28.680> this

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
I know it's another thumb but again this

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.210 
I know it's another thumb but again this
is<00:05:29.100> internal<00:05:29.940> coloration<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:30.660> that<00:05:31.110> what<00:05:32.010> it's

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
is internal coloration so that what it's

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.420 
is internal coloration so that what it's
to<00:05:32.790> show<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.220> color

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
to show you is to that this is the color

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.120 
to show you is to that this is the color
as<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:35.940> comes<00:05:36.210> out<00:05:36.420> of<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.600> mold<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.170> then<00:05:37.740> we

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
as it comes out of the mold and then we

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.670 
as it comes out of the mold and then we
just<00:05:38.370> hopefully<00:05:38.820> with<00:05:38.970> luck<00:05:39.450> we're<00:05:39.690> just<00:05:39.960> kind

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
just hopefully with luck we're just kind

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.500 
just hopefully with luck we're just kind
of<00:05:40.740> blending<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.250> few<00:05:41.460> imperfections<00:05:41.820> and

a<00:05:48.690> better<00:05:49.020> surface<00:05:49.440> texture<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.640> know<00:05:50.670> just

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
a better surface texture you know just

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.550 
a better surface texture you know just
when<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.270> use<00:05:51.480> a<00:05:51.510> life<00:05:51.780> cache<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.290> has<00:05:52.410> all

when you use a life cache it has all

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.450 
when you use a life cache it has all
these<00:05:52.710> nice<00:05:52.980> human<00:05:53.370> textures<00:05:55.220> you<00:05:56.220> know<00:05:56.310> what

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
these nice human textures you know what

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.020 
these nice human textures you know what
we're<00:05:56.610> trying<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.120> then<00:05:57.330> is<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:59.030> recreate

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
we're trying to do then is to recreate

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.790 
we're trying to do then is to recreate
