00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
we're gonna be going over two concepts

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.089 
we're gonna be going over two concepts
from<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.270> book<00:00:06.450> Prairie<00:00:06.720> Pointe<00:00:06.960> pizzazz<00:00:07.440> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
from the book Prairie Pointe pizzazz the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.620 
from the book Prairie Pointe pizzazz the
first<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.550> how<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.730> make<00:00:09.030> Prairie<00:00:09.269> points

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
first is how to make Prairie points

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.780 
first is how to make Prairie points
which<00:00:09.780> are<00:00:09.900> incredibly<00:00:10.559> simple<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
which are incredibly simple and the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.339 
which are incredibly simple and the
second<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.269> how<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> insert<00:00:12.870> them<00:00:13.049> into<00:00:13.230> your

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
second is how to insert them into your

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.099 
second is how to insert them into your
patchwork<00:00:13.980> using<00:00:14.490> either<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> template<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
patchwork using either a template or the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.870 
patchwork using either a template or the
acrylic<00:00:16.650> placement<00:00:17.100> guide<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.520> we've<00:00:17.699> had

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
acrylic placement guide that we've had

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
acrylic placement guide that we've had
developed<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.750> purpose<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.380> love

developed just for this purpose I love

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.279 
developed just for this purpose I love
this<00:00:20.430> new<00:00:20.640> technique<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> allows<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this new technique because it allows you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
this new technique because it allows you
to<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.619> able<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.859> put<00:00:23.130> Prairie<00:00:23.430> points<00:00:23.789> into

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
to be able to put Prairie points into

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.080 
to be able to put Prairie points into
any<00:00:24.300> half<00:00:24.630> roof<00:00:24.869> quarter-square<00:00:25.650> triangle

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
any half roof quarter-square triangle

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
any half roof quarter-square triangle
giving<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.210> quotes<00:00:27.710> added<00:00:28.710> new<00:00:28.890> dimension

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
giving your quotes added new dimension

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
giving your quotes added new dimension
that<00:00:29.640> maybe<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.090> didn't<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> before<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that maybe they didn't have before so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
fabric in half we'll then press it into
a<00:01:04.049> rectangle<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.390> folded

a rectangle and take the two folded

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140 
a rectangle and take the two folded
edges<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.650> bring<00:01:08.159> them<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.520> towards<00:01:09.000> the

edges and bring them down towards the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.520 
edges and bring them down towards the
center<00:01:09.450> raw<00:01:10.320> edge<00:01:11.240> at<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> bottom<00:01:12.530> we're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
center raw edge at the bottom we're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
center raw edge at the bottom we're
gonna<00:01:13.619> press<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.340> place<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
gonna press this in place and I like to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
gonna press this in place and I like to
use<00:01:15.840> steam<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.530> purpose<00:01:16.979> okay<00:01:17.790> you'll

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
use steam for this purpose okay you'll

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990 
use steam for this purpose okay you'll
notice<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> book<00:01:19.830> I'll<00:01:19.979> talk<00:01:20.189> often

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
notice that in the book I'll talk often

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.420 
notice that in the book I'll talk often
about<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.689> using<00:01:21.900> steam<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.920> patchwork

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
about not using steam in my patchwork

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
about not using steam in my patchwork
and<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> has<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> tendency<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and that's because it has a tendency to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
and that's because it has a tendency to
distort<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> bias<00:01:25.920> edges<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> use

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
distort the bias edges but I like to use

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.210 
distort the bias edges but I like to use
it<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> prairie<00:01:28.380> points<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it for the prairie points because it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.310 
it for the prairie points because it
gives<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> nice<00:01:29.790> crisp<00:01:30.180> edge

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
gives it a nice crisp edge

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.690 
gives it a nice crisp edge
once<00:01:33.320> again<00:01:33.530> let's<00:01:33.890> go<00:01:34.040> over<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.400> we're

what I like to do is take a piece of my

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.719 
what I like to do is take a piece of my
quarter<00:01:52.820> inch<00:01:53.590> steam<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.619> seam<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.220> place<00:01:55.490> it

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
quarter inch steam a seam and place it

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.350 
quarter inch steam a seam and place it
in<00:01:55.880> here<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.539> do<00:01:57.289> a<00:01:57.320> second<00:01:58.159> press<00:01:58.430> what<00:01:59.180> this

in here and do a second press what this

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.660 
in here and do a second press what this
does<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.780> fuse<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.289> folds<00:02:00.710> into<00:02:01.009> place<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
does is fuse the folds into place and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.130 
does is fuse the folds into place and
that<00:02:01.700> way<00:02:02.000> when<00:02:02.210> we're<00:02:02.360> getting<00:02:02.600> ready<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.840> sew

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that way when we're getting ready to sew

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.260 
that way when we're getting ready to sew
later<00:02:03.439> we<00:02:03.950> don't<00:02:04.100> have<00:02:04.399> them<00:02:04.580> popping<00:02:05.060> open

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
later we don't have them popping open

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.910 
later we don't have them popping open
and<00:02:05.569> potentially<00:02:06.110> missing<00:02:06.350> them<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:06.800> our

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
and potentially missing them in our

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.040 
and potentially missing them in our
patchwork<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:08.330> next<00:02:08.600> thing<00:02:08.750> we're<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:08.989> to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
patchwork the next thing we're going to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.650 
patchwork the next thing we're going to
do<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:10.190> we're<00:02:10.369> going<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.549> go<00:02:10.700> ahead<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.330> fuse

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
do is we're going to go ahead and fuse

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.320 
do is we're going to go ahead and fuse
our<00:02:11.840> Prairie<00:02:12.110> points<00:02:12.590> onto<00:02:12.769> our<00:02:13.330> triangles

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
our Prairie points onto our triangles

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.210 
our Prairie points onto our triangles
then<00:02:14.540> as<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.049> said<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.410> could<00:02:15.560> use<00:02:15.739> either<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
then as I said you could use either the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.910 
then as I said you could use either the
plastic<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:16.940> acrylic<00:02:17.510> template<00:02:18.019> what

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
plastic or the acrylic template what

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.229 
plastic or the acrylic template what
we're<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.580> we're<00:02:19.730> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.880> line

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
we're going to do is we're going to line

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.240 
we're going to do is we're going to line
that<00:02:20.569> template<00:02:21.019> up<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> triangle<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
that template up with the triangle so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.070 
that template up with the triangle so
that<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.549> perfectly<00:02:23.060> aligned<00:02:23.540> along<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that it's perfectly aligned along the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.979 
that it's perfectly aligned along the
edges<00:02:24.850> we're<00:02:25.850> going<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.030> take<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.269> piece<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.870> our

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
edges we're going to take a piece of our

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.120 
edges we're going to take a piece of our
quarter<00:02:27.410> inch<00:02:27.440> steam<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> seam<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:30.019> lay<00:02:31.010> it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
quarter inch steam a seam and lay it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.729 
quarter inch steam a seam and lay it
along<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.610> bottom<00:02:31.819> raw<00:02:32.450> edge<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.530> want

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
along the bottom raw edge and you want

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.559 
along the bottom raw edge and you want
to<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.130> as<00:02:34.220> close<00:02:34.489> as<00:02:34.670> possible<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
to get that as close as possible to the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.569 
to get that as close as possible to the
bottom<00:02:35.870> raw<00:02:36.049> edge<00:02:36.260> without<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:37.010> over<00:02:37.430> it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
bottom raw edge without going over it

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.000 
bottom raw edge without going over it
this<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.540> two<00:02:38.750> reasons<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.380> if<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.859> goes

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
this is for two reasons one if it goes

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.460 
this is for two reasons one if it goes
over<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:41.150> steam<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> seam<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.410> to

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
over it the steam a seam is going to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.800 
over it the steam a seam is going to
melt<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.980> your<00:02:43.340> iron<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.239> your<00:02:44.450> ironing

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
melt on your iron and on your ironing

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.020 
melt on your iron and on your ironing
board<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.260> second<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.910> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
board and second because it is just a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.759 
board and second because it is just a
quarter<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.510> an<00:02:47.630> inch<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.320> fuse<00:02:48.590> our

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
quarter of an inch when we fuse our

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.650 
quarter of an inch when we fuse our
prairie<00:02:49.010> point<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.579> it's<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.420> get

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
prairie point to it it's going to get

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
prairie point to it it's going to get
totally<00:02:51.200> lost<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.070> seam<00:02:52.280> allowance<00:02:52.760> which

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
totally lost in the seam allowance which

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880 
totally lost in the seam allowance which
is<00:02:53.030> perfect<00:02:53.570> it's<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.900> magic<00:02:54.410> nobody<00:02:54.739> will

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
is perfect it's like magic nobody will

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.770 
is perfect it's like magic nobody will
ever<00:02:55.100> know<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.370> was<00:02:55.579> there<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.600> we're<00:02:56.720> gonna

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
ever know it was there so we're gonna

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.990 
ever know it was there so we're gonna
place<00:02:57.170> these<00:02:57.440> elements<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.220> we're<00:02:58.910> gonna

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
place these elements there we're gonna

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.120 
place these elements there we're gonna
Snug<00:02:59.480> our<00:02:59.720> prairie<00:03:00.049> point<00:03:00.350> up<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.890> guide

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
Snug our prairie point up to that guide

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
Snug our prairie point up to that guide
we're<00:03:01.880> gonna<00:03:01.970> move<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.600> guide<00:03:02.780> out<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.170> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
we're gonna move the guide out of the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.410 
we're gonna move the guide out of the
way<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.859> then<00:03:04.220> we're<00:03:04.370> simply<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.150> fuse

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
way and then we're simply going to fuse

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.780 
way and then we're simply going to fuse
it<00:03:05.570> into<00:03:05.690> place<00:03:06.109> once<00:03:06.890> again<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> like<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.640> use

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
it into place once again I like to use

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.060 
it into place once again I like to use
steam<00:03:08.239> for<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.170> only<00:03:09.380> challenge<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.859> have

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
steam for this the only challenge I have

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.860 
steam for this the only challenge I have
with<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:10.820> sometimes<00:03:11.030> fogs<00:03:11.510> up<00:03:11.720> my

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
with it is that it sometimes fogs up my

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.650 
with it is that it sometimes fogs up my
glasses<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.160> now<00:03:13.280> we<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.579> perfectly<00:03:14.239> fused

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
glasses so now we have a perfectly fused

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.960 
glasses so now we have a perfectly fused
prairie<00:03:15.079> point<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> triangle<00:03:16.130> now<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
prairie point on a triangle now the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.910 
prairie point on a triangle now the
beauty<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.630> steam<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> seam<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.739> as

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
beauty of the steam a seam is that as

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.370 
beauty of the steam a seam is that as
you<00:03:19.190> can<00:03:19.340> see<00:03:19.549> here<00:03:20.060> or<00:03:20.209> not<00:03:20.569> see<00:03:20.870> as<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.200> case

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
you can see here or not see as the case

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.940 
you can see here or not see as the case
may<00:03:21.620> be

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
may be

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.580 
may be
it<00:03:22.010> dries<00:03:22.549> perfectly<00:03:23.329> clear<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.140> when<00:03:24.290> we<00:03:24.380> get

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
it dries perfectly clear so when we get

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.590

square triangles so we would simply

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.410 
square triangles so we would simply
marry<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.520> then<00:04:04.670> sew<00:04:04.850> our<00:04:05.000> quarter
