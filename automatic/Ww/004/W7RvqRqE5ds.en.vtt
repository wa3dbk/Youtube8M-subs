00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi how about friends from your side of the 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.890
 personal seeds of your channel and in this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.760
 I am going to show you how to be able to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.429
 get what is the tubes bar 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.080
 like the galaxy s 5 and also what is 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.920
 this bar of multitasking and good 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.920
 we start 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 very good guys this is very simple 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.160
 this is achieved with an exposÃ© module and if 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320
 you have to be root you have to have installed 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 the ex post framework I will leave it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 the videos to both so they can 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 router your device and also so that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 can install the exposed and good a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.360
 Once this is done, let's move on to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.910
 download module let's put that 5 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.210
 and automatically here we can search 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.750
 what does that 5 system white en force say 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.640
 nou 3 I repeat is what came to me 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.940
 here and other things like the new blockade 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.350
 extended the screen blah blah blah but not 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.050
 it happens that we are interested is this here 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.970
 we are going to give it what we are going to install 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.420
 to download it let's activate and we will 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.740
 do the corresponding reboot and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.980
 automatically since we activate it here 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.900
 I have it activated 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.560
 Well, it would be as simple as the tubes already 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.740
 they would change shape here we already have the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.990
 that are from the galaxy s 5 all that are 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.630
 are activated and deactivated then 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.210
 equal to how they would be deactivated or 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.370
 would be activated on our device and 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.770
 in a galaxy it is 5 that we can see 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.290
 we can edit them reorder them blah blah 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.200
 blah 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.790
 In general, I would say it's a bit more 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 compatible for devices that have 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.730
 the most customizable tubes for the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.370
 galaxy and well I also found myself 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.980
 with the surprise that also the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.290
 multitasking can be done here we have 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.700
 all the applications that we 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.250
 we have the administrator in multitasking 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 of good tasks was also changed as 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.660
 the galaxy 5 here we have a small 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.540
 icon to be able to close all the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.390
 events we are going to go finally for 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.860
 finalize what this module is and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.910
 well here the options we have 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.709
 the grid of that tics of the galaxy s 5 the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.880
 subject is 5 if we want to change a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.590
 color we can also have the menu of the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.350
 s5 when we go to shut down here they are 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.820
 seeing all the icons and well I think that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.860
 that of recording account and I put it with 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.080
 something else that did not come but what about the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 icons and here we have if we want to put 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 the three ways of reboot that is the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.740
 recovery download and normal 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.360
 the percentage of applications the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.569
 brightness animations because also 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.000
 we can make brightness by sliding 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.310
 back and forth I think that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.230
 it's also a good thing we can put 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.870
 well there's the sphincter button 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.600
 for those of us who have the galaxy the time 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.630
 some extra and good configurations 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.090
 this I hope you liked it 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.450
 let's go back to what is this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470
 Application the tubes the brightness for 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.350
 move forward and backward 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.769
 we have multitasking we also have the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.800
 power button that also comes with 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.630
 the icons of the s5 and well I hope that you 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.100
 I liked that if you liked the little hand 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.260

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.850
