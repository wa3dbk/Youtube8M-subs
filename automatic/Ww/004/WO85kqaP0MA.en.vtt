00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.570
 because ashes «I have a small call to you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.259
 in fact 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.539
 Child her meat means 300 arguments Special 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.169
 that means West on let's play Super Mario 64 damage st 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.900
 in this video what he actually has to see too little 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 Forward 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.539
 you all the surmounted flirts come before several Marius 64 dappled 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.449
 and I have the video even today somehow 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.039
 very interesting 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.219
 and funny though at that time I was a bit quiet Worms and Moo Hyun Chu 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.160
 it is already good 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 and as long as I have many people the language does not matter either 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.999
 Mario Galaxy 2 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.290
 classic our party filed a complaint 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.090
 here and there prevails - under 8 5 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.900
 Block why me 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.950
 an urban originally at that time ago 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.470
 to make such a pass on Schmitz to any project when it's done 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.540
 but i think that does not suit him project and around 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.909
 it would be too much 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.010
 exhausting and too much 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 Has the best time on Switzerland 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.010
 Years ago Sam 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850
 Therefore, I have decided no there is 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.810
 already 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 To make Super Mario Galaxy 2 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540
 it is like that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.700
 she plays a little less are compared in a park there is less 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.640
 for her, no doubt you order 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 but there are hundreds 9 30 degrees today 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.380
 in the penultimate game 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.390
 and morning follows then the 109 30 are his last last star 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 purchase 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 and around 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 "I hate front so honest 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.540
 during the day 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.800
 I thought 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.560
 slipping out of the middle voted does not do that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 So um 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990
 one seeks 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.400
 you do not have to have the perfect Super Mario Galaxy Brass on it 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 but was looking for a mixture of mix here finds Schönefeld 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.710
 Servo you can laugh about it or even just smile 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 it's enough 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.080
 and divorce little bit together about data like high as a video response 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.109
 this song in july 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.700
 and be by scan 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 that may be but it will be sure that just so many patients could 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.529
 Now not all 133 fits again and check through 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.349
 which was good and what was bad 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 one percent cuts funny places together 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.329
 and I coke more and of course no tree RWE here on 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.909
 full power 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.900
 But who really bothers me really looking forward to being a best-of Super Mario 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.699
 Galaxy 2 would have 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.699
 that was really interesting horny order 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.809
 weaker cuddle now a bit of cheese but still 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.379
 the one before that European yet 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.249
 worth seeing 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.209
 could 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.639
 how should I say cuts 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.559
 the things together 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.260
 Maybe there is not here if you want the material is so 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.119
 a lot of budget 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.369
 there is a play train download 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:07.090
 she would have to enter the address and artists 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.599
 download 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.330
 But what is in one? 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.749
 finally 4 format 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.749
 and then I use that for example 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.989
 the program is called partial 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:19.819
 Schumi 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.819
 MP 4 2 Rafi converter 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.269
 Round Switzerland Simon who ice this program 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.579
 I hope 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.469
 and an enemy ever 2 archive converter inspiration study finds the program 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.379
 beautiful 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.240
 and thus for the preservation of this 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.919
 Grunder loaded videos 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.059
 and comment 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.770
 and then you can go to YouTube 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.149
 thought dead already for example just on Movie Maker 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.219
 I also did not write it together 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:50.959
 and I would be very happy 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.049
 if you would do that 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.509
 and not just one and if there are more 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.279
 and if trichet ski resort in the finish still parts because I want your videos 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.199
 to take 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.999
 they really cut together a super horny best on two operas 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.769
 that's what i would do maybe paddock one of you buck 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.749
 to go down so far 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.749
 But I think it's great if you want to participate in it 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.620
 but being a bit interactive and swinging like that 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.419
 and that's all I had to say now 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.289
 EA is laughing at friends 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.249
 I would be very happy so 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.369
 there is also Super Mario Galaxy 2 stood a scout us I wait for 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:38.490
 your video answers 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.770
 have fun 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.250
 It will be a bit exhausting but believe me the result will be 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.309
 certainly 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.139
 Aachen strong 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.439
 then I say goodbye for the moment 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.430
 and I'm looking forward to your video ads 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.009
