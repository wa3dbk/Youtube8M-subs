the<00:02:29.750> ultimate<00:02:30.050> fighter<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:31.550> looks<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.090> be<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
the ultimate fighter it looks to be a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.850 
the ultimate fighter it looks to be a
really<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:32.960> good<00:02:33.140> fight<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.770> know

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
really really good fight you know

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.250 
really really good fight you know
Gideon's<00:02:34.250> got<00:02:34.520> some<00:02:34.700> good<00:02:34.820> credentials<00:02:35.260> this

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
Gideon's got some good credentials this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.980 
Gideon's got some good credentials this
is<00:02:36.440> probably<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.770> big<00:02:36.920> step<00:02:37.130> up<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.520> him<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
is probably a big step up for him in the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.600 
is probably a big step up for him in the
experience<00:02:39.440> level<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.860> John's<00:02:40.130> bring<00:02:40.400> into

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
experience level that John's bring into

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.830 
experience level that John's bring into
this<00:02:40.730> fight<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.210> I<00:02:41.270> think<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:41.600> going<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.750> be

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
this fight but I think it's going to be

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.360 
this fight but I think it's going to be
a<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.080> good<00:02:42.260> fight

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
fights he fought Georges st. Pierre he

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.779 
fights he fought Georges st. Pierre he
had<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.650> tough<00:04:40.889> fight<00:04:41.100> against<00:04:41.400> Jonathan

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
had the tough fight against Jonathan

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.939 
had the tough fight against Jonathan
Goulet<00:04:42.060> which<00:04:42.330> he<00:04:42.449> was<00:04:42.600> dominating<00:04:43.050> but<00:04:43.320> ended

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
Goulet which he was dominating but ended

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.310 
Goulet which he was dominating but ended
up<00:04:44.009> with<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> cut<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.669> ended<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> fight<00:04:45.320> so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
up with the cut that ended the fight so

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.590 
up with the cut that ended the fight so
he<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.710> hasn't<00:04:46.919> had<00:04:47.250> some<00:04:47.430> bad<00:04:47.580> luck<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:48.060> think

the ifl was good for him the team format

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.640 
the ifl was good for him the team format

we didn't have to worry about being cut
or<00:04:52.949> any<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.280> stuff<00:04:53.690> when<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.720> say<00:04:54.960> cut<00:04:55.229> I

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.670 
think first and foremost he's got a guy
komaki<00:05:21.539> that's<00:05:21.840> fought<00:05:22.050> some<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.470> top

the<00:06:54.159> UFC<00:06:54.519> maybe<00:06:54.789> feels<00:06:55.119> like<00:06:55.269> they<00:06:55.419> should

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:55.989 
the UFC maybe feels like they should

what happens with affliction moving

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:04.109 
what happens with affliction moving
forward<00:07:03.159> i<00:07:03.189> don't<00:07:03.369> i<00:07:03.459> don't<00:07:03.490> really<00:07:03.699> know<00:07:03.819> i'm

00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:04.119 
forward i don't i don't really know i'm

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:05.189 
forward i don't i don't really know i'm
not<00:07:04.269> sure<00:07:04.449> what's<00:07:04.689> going<00:07:04.809> to<00:07:04.869> happen<00:07:05.139> with

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199

not sure what's going to happen with
them

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.630 

yeah<00:07:16.630> I<00:07:16.660> think<00:07:17.170> because<00:07:17.980> it's<00:07:18.160> in<00:07:18.280> a<00:07:18.370> ring

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
yeah I think because it's in a ring

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.820 
yeah I think because it's in a ring
it'll<00:07:19.390> be<00:07:19.450> a<00:07:19.480> little<00:07:19.780> harder<00:07:20.200> for<00:07:20.410> Hector<00:07:20.680> to

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
it'll be a little harder for Hector to

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.380 
it'll be a little harder for Hector to
take<00:07:21.010> advantage<00:07:21.280> of<00:07:21.580> the<00:07:21.700> wrestling<00:07:22.090> skills

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390 
take advantage of the wrestling skills

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.410 
take advantage of the wrestling skills
that<00:07:22.570> he<00:07:22.630> probably<00:07:22.810> has<00:07:23.140> over<00:07:23.470> Rick<00:07:23.680> and

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
that he probably has over Rick and

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.300 
that he probably has over Rick and
Hector's<00:07:25.420> demeanor<00:07:25.840> and<00:07:26.080> he<00:07:26.320> wants<00:07:26.830> to<00:07:26.950> go<00:07:27.100> in

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
Hector's demeanor and he wants to go in

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.100 
Hector's demeanor and he wants to go in
there<00:07:27.460> and<00:07:27.580> bang<00:07:27.790> he<00:07:28.060> loves<00:07:28.300> to<00:07:28.480> put<00:07:28.630> on<00:07:28.750> a<00:07:28.780> show

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
there and bang he loves to put on a show

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.200 
there and bang he loves to put on a show
I<00:07:29.410> mean<00:07:29.890> his<00:07:30.190> fight<00:07:30.400> with<00:07:30.430> James<00:07:30.730> urban<00:07:31.060> in<00:07:31.150> the

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
I mean his fight with James urban in the

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.940 
I mean his fight with James urban in the
UFC<00:07:31.450> didn't<00:07:32.050> have<00:07:32.200> to<00:07:32.380> go<00:07:32.530> that<00:07:32.680> way<00:07:32.740> but

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
UFC didn't have to go that way but

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.890 
UFC didn't have to go that way but
that's<00:07:33.520> the<00:07:33.730> kind<00:07:33.850> of<00:07:33.970> fights<00:07:34.180> he<00:07:34.330> likes<00:07:34.600> and

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
that's the kind of fights he likes and

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.930 
that's the kind of fights he likes and
so<00:07:35.050> you<00:07:35.680> know<00:07:35.710> that<00:07:35.950> makes<00:07:36.160> this<00:07:36.340> a<00:07:36.400> very<00:07:36.550> very

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
so you know that makes this a very very
