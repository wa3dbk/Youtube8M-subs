shiny<00:01:15.740> hollow<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:18.270> than<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
shiny hollow that I got more than one of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.969 
shiny hollow that I got more than one of
so<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> double<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.619> which<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> quite

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so a double of it which is quite

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.940 
so a double of it which is quite
surprising<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.909> yeah<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> first

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
surprising but yeah and it was the first

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
surprising but yeah and it was the first
card<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.240> banned<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.810> one

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

point and I think it's one of those only
like<00:01:39.960> bad<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.610> cause<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.509> over
