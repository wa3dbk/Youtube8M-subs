but the cool thing about this guitar is
I've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> shadow<00:00:58.469> kill<00:00:58.890> pot<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.670> volume

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.530 

you<00:01:04.129> just<00:01:04.340> push<00:01:04.550> down<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.120> it<00:01:05.210> kills<00:01:05.420> the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
signal which might be fine for anyway

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.320 
signal which might be fine for anyway
probably<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.430> annoying<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:16.940> quick<00:01:17.150> too

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
probably get annoying really quick too

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.640 
probably get annoying really quick too
but<00:01:17.600> some<00:01:17.870> people<00:01:18.140> will<00:01:18.230> be<00:01:18.320> able<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.500> make

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
but some people will be able to make

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.910 
but some people will be able to make
music<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.190> it'll<00:01:19.310> be<00:01:19.460> fine<00:01:20.440> I've<00:01:21.440> got<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
