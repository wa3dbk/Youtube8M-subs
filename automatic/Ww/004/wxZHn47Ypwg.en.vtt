00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.170
 I'm going to talk about the vague anchor 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:13.240
 to make a bank g we must 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.950
 use minimum dynamic strings of 9 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.880
 millimeters and new rope 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.759
 the knots that we are going to use 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.840
 for fastening the carabiners goes to 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.710
 be the triple fisherman because as you see 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.820
 let's be this knot 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.620
 Fix the carabiner prevents it from moving 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.460
 How can it happen for example with 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.460
 another type of knot 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.260
 every time we hang them it goes to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.260
 tighten more 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.829
 also the carabiners that we should 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 use must be carabiners without 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.870
 have here any kind of revavÃ¡ like 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.260
 I'll give you this example so you can see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.109
 the difference 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.619
 this this burr could get us 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.720
 both in the sheets and in any 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.790
 a tow and others and then bother to 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.790
 the time to have to take the wash 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.670
 after the length the length we can 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.979
 make it to the taste of each person always 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.630
 and when once we 're hanging on 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.500
 the vague we arrive perfectly with 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.350
 our hand to the longer wander 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.410
 and then I also used in the vaga 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 long safety carabiner and in the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.240
 another a carabiner 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.369
 Uninsured 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.289
 this also helps us to differentiate with 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.920
 the touch nothing else when the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:48.229
 long and what is our short wander 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 then the anchor knot to our harness 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.619
 to our ventral ring he used a by 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.890
 string because I used string that good 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.430
 this knot as we all know slides to 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.649
 the 400 kilos of load this makes that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 before an eventual fall the force of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.110
 shock that we are going to receive because it is something 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 smaller than with other types of knots 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 and it's over 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 it was not work
