00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
on peaceful which i'm doing for this

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.849 
on peaceful which i'm doing for this
tutorial<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:26.300> your<00:00:27.300> next<00:00:27.510> step<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.199> find

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
tutorial and your next step is to find

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.990 
tutorial and your next step is to find
the<00:00:29.010> front<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.949> your<00:00:32.000> trap

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the front of your of your of your trap

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
the front of your of your of your trap
so<00:00:33.300> front<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.410> facing<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.890> way

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so front is going to be facing this way

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
so front is going to be facing this way
so<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so what you're going to want to do is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
so what you're going to want to do is
just<00:00:37.079> block<00:00:37.440> off<00:00:37.649> everything<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> mobs

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just block off everything so the mobs

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.459 
just block off everything so the mobs
cannot<00:00:39.629> spawn<00:00:40.219> back<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:45.170> just<00:00:46.170> block

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
cannot spawn back there so just block

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.330 
cannot spawn back there so just block
off<00:00:46.710> everything<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
off everything like this and this is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
off everything like this and this is
just<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.699> make<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.210> mobs<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.870> nowhere

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
just to make it so the mobs have nowhere

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
just to make it so the mobs have nowhere
else<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> except<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.100> indie<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.699> trap

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
else to go except for indie or trap

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.319 
else to go except for indie or trap
which<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> water-based<00:00:58.770> trap

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
which is going to be a water-based trap

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
which is going to be a water-based trap
it's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> high<00:01:00.510> killer<00:01:00.840> easy<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.770> kill<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> sort

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it's a high killer easy to kill and sort

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's a high killer easy to kill and sort
and<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.989> easy<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> collect<00:01:04.470> their<00:01:05.010> items

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and it's easy to collect their items

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
and it's easy to collect their items
from<00:01:05.610> too<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:07.850> yeah<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.119> basically<00:01:09.570> clear

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
from too and yeah just basically clear

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.820 
from too and yeah just basically clear
up<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:11.150> clog<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> entire<00:01:12.750> back<00:01:13.049> space<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
up will clog up the entire back space of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.109 
up will clog up the entire back space of
your<00:01:13.979> mob<00:01:14.159> spawner<00:01:14.490> trap<00:01:14.990> like<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.759> all<00:01:17.759> the

front of it you're going to have steps

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.530 
front of it you're going to have steps
going<00:01:26.970> down<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.939> front<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
going down like this so in front of it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080 
going down like this so in front of it
you're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.890> drop<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.970> with

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that so the right as they spawn they're

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.810 
that so the right as they spawn they're
going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.140> falling<00:01:37.140> already<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:38.189> dropping
