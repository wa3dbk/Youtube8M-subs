as<00:00:49.469> far<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:49.890> concerned<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.579> it's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as far as I'm concerned because it's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260 
as far as I'm concerned because it's
kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> niche<00:00:51.360> market<00:00:52.910> some<00:00:53.910> people<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
kind of a niche market some people that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700 
kind of a niche market some people that
don't<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.629> Broadway<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
don't know Broadway and don't know the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
don't know Broadway and don't know the
shows<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.340> no<00:00:56.489> interest<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> tuning

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
shows really have no interest in tuning

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.930 
shows really have no interest in tuning
and<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.690> sort<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.079> job<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.649> encourage

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
and so it's sort of my job to encourage

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
and so it's sort of my job to encourage
people<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.329> watch<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

and then they don't get many nominations

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.759

then<00:03:06.110> we're<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.980> little<00:03:07.280> bit<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.079> weeds<00:03:09.319> and
