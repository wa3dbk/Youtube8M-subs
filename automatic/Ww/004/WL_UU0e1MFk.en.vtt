coast in Oahu and today we're going to
be<00:00:14.879> building<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.420> sprayer<00:00:16.200> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
be building a sprayer this is a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
be building a sprayer this is a
agricultural<00:00:17.880> sprayer<00:00:18.150> simple<00:00:18.599> homemade

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
agricultural sprayer simple homemade

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
agricultural sprayer simple homemade
sprayer<00:00:19.259> so<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.009> first<00:00:20.189> thing<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.460> got<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
sprayer so the first thing we got is the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
sprayer so the first thing we got is the
main<00:00:21.270> ingredient<00:00:21.750> here's<00:00:22.230> our<00:00:22.380> shirt<00:00:22.619> flow

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
main ingredient here's our shirt flow

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.240 
main ingredient here's our shirt flow
pump<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:24.360> a<00:00:24.390> diaphragm<00:00:24.930> pump<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.470> when

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
pump it's a diaphragm pump so when

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.499 
pump it's a diaphragm pump so when
you're<00:00:26.369> doing<00:00:26.460> compost<00:00:26.939> teas<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.239> whatnot

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
you're doing compost teas and whatnot

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.729 
you're doing compost teas and whatnot
this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.079> to<00:00:28.169> destroy<00:00:28.439> all<00:00:28.710> your

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
this is not going to destroy all your

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.519 
this is not going to destroy all your
microorganisms<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.720> real<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.259> like<00:00:31.380> that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
microorganisms it's real it's like that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.990 
microorganisms it's real it's like that
just<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.770> simple<00:00:32.040> diaphragm<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just a simple diaphragm going up and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
just a simple diaphragm going up and
down<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> protect<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.649> your

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
down so it's going to protect all your

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
down so it's going to protect all your
microbial<00:00:35.280> life<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.970> an<00:00:36.120> ideal<00:00:36.480> pump

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
microbial life so this is an ideal pump

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
microbial life so this is an ideal pump
especially<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.590> doing<00:00:38.100> biological<00:00:38.940> sprays

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
especially for doing biological sprays

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.050 
especially for doing biological sprays
so<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> couple<00:00:40.320> connectors<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.610> 14

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
so a couple connectors this is a 14

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.480 
so a couple connectors this is a 14

stores this is just a simple easy wire
hookup<00:00:47.840> we're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.990> to<00:00:49.050> run<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.350> thing

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
hookup we're going to run this thing

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.440 
hookup we're going to run this thing
with<00:00:49.740> a<00:00:49.770> switch<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.670> I'll<00:00:51.000> turn<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
with a switch so I'll turn this on and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.840 
with a switch so I'll turn this on and
off<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.050> pump<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.400> built-in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
off this pump actually has a built-in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.210 
off this pump actually has a built-in
on/off<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> pressure<00:00:55.410> switch<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
on/off it's a pressure switch so when I

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.770 
on/off it's a pressure switch so when I
turn<00:00:56.520> our<00:00:56.730> sprayer<00:00:57.000> when<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.570> hit<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
turn our sprayer when I just hit the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.870 
turn our sprayer when I just hit the
nozzle<00:00:58.110> on<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.260> Springs<00:00:58.560> it'll<00:00:59.340> automatically

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
nozzle on my Springs it'll automatically

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.030 
nozzle on my Springs it'll automatically
start<00:01:00.180> spraying<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.770> here

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
start spraying all right so right here

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.660 
start spraying all right so right here
we've<00:01:02.280> got<00:01:02.310> this<00:01:02.850> taken<00:01:03.540> apart<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.829> panel

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
we've got this taken apart this panel

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
we've got this taken apart this panel
we're<00:01:06.299> hooking<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> on-and-off<00:01:06.990> switch<00:01:07.020> up

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we're hooking the on-and-off switch up

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160 
we're hooking the on-and-off switch up
for<00:01:07.890> our<00:01:07.979> pump<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> we're<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> hook<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
for our pump so we're going to hook this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.569 
for our pump so we're going to hook this
up<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.710> turn<00:01:10.799> our<00:01:10.950> sprayer<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.399> from

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
up so we can turn our sprayer on from

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.570 
up so we can turn our sprayer on from
inside<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.650> for<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:13.800> inside<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.190> cab<00:01:14.340> while

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
inside or for right inside the cab while

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
inside or for right inside the cab while
we're<00:01:14.790> driving<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.950> necessary

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
we're driving so this is not a necessary

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
we're driving so this is not a necessary
step<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.240> an<00:01:18.330> extra<00:01:18.570> step<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> can

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
step but this is an extra step you can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
step but this is an extra step you can
do<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.800> life<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.220> easier<00:01:20.580> so

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
then we're just going to run these wires

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
then we're just going to run these wires
put<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.370> in<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:24.240> wires<00:01:24.510> will<00:01:24.720> be

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
put this back in these wires will be

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.920 
put this back in these wires will be
running<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
running down here and we're going to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.490 
running down here and we're going to
hide<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.409> underneath<00:01:30.020> back<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
hide them all underneath back in here so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
hide them all underneath back in here so
it's<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.979> hidden<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.420> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
their natural pesticides will come in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.789 
their natural pesticides will come in
and<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.329> this<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.570> going<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.720> come<00:03:52.900> here<00:03:53.170> we<00:03:53.650> got

and so this is going to come here we got

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.569 
and so this is going to come here we got
a<00:03:53.829> filter<00:03:54.160> now<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:56.340> filtration<00:03:57.340> system

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
a filter now this is a filtration system

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.250 
a filter now this is a filtration system
to<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.150> any<00:03:58.299> particles<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:58.959> this<00:03:59.079> will

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
to get on any particles so this will

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.380 
to get on any particles so this will
keep<00:03:59.530> our<00:03:59.739> pump<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.280> good<00:04:00.670> shape<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.000> keep<00:04:01.269> it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
keep our pump in good shape and keep it
