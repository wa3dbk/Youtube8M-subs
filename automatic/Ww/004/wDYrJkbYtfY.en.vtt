00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.740 
a pink one actually really like the
color<00:03:00.390> blue<00:03:00.510> pink<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:02.210> then<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.480> has

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
color blue pink and then this one has

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.360 
color blue pink and then this one has
less<00:03:03.990> air<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.770> feel<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
less air in it and I feel like it is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.090 
less air in it and I feel like it is
pretty<00:03:05.760> full<00:03:06.090> raising<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:10.100> also

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
pretty full raising and then also

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:28.400 
pretty full raising and then also
thought<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:26.600> really<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.959> they<00:03:28.140> come

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
thought I really like that they come

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.290 
thought I really like that they come
with<00:03:28.590> ball<00:03:28.860> change<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:30.150> excited

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
with ball change so I'm really excited

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.070 
with ball change so I'm really excited
about<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.900> um<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:32.370> also<00:03:33.300> have<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
about that um I also have to get the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.480 
about that um I also have to get the
green<00:03:34.320> one<00:03:34.650> because<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:34.980> there's<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> green

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
green one because I know there's a green

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.940 
green one because I know there's a green
one<00:03:35.700> but<00:03:35.970> something<00:03:36.600> happened<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.290> totally

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
one but something happened and I totally

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.980 
one but something happened and I totally
messed<00:03:38.760> up<00:03:38.910> my<00:03:38.970> order<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> didn't<00:03:39.870> get<00:03:39.959> a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
messed up my order so I didn't get a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.930 
messed up my order so I didn't get a
green<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.890> super<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.610> i<00:03:41.670> think<00:03:41.760> i
