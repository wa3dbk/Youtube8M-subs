some<00:03:49.049> people<00:03:49.169> might<00:03:49.319> notice<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.829> more<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
some people might notice it more but I

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.059 
some people might notice it more but I
don't<00:03:50.669> know<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.450> as<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.840> see

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
don't know but as you can see

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.659 
don't know but as you can see
transitions<00:03:53.269> very<00:03:54.269> smooth<00:03:56.000> was<00:03:57.000> opening<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
transitions very smooth was opening the

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.819 
transitions very smooth was opening the
the<00:03:59.669> apps<00:03:59.849> menu<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.540> think<00:04:01.470> that's<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.739> it's

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the apps menu I think that's what it's

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.080 
the apps menu I think that's what it's
called<00:04:01.980> an<00:04:02.190> Android<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:05.310> has<00:04:05.579> made<00:04:05.790> things

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
called an Android so it has made things

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.039 
called an Android so it has made things
a<00:04:06.569> little<00:04:07.500> smoother<00:04:08.099> nothing<00:04:09.060> too<00:04:09.329> crazy<00:04:09.569> but

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
a little smoother nothing too crazy but

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.099 
a little smoother nothing too crazy but
I<00:04:10.319> would<00:04:10.950> definitely<00:04:11.069> upgrade<00:04:11.609> or<00:04:12.540> update

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
I would definitely upgrade or update

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.470 
I would definitely upgrade or update

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
transformer the TF 300 was the first to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.209 
transformer the TF 300 was the first to
get<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.709> update<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:21.800> let's<00:04:22.800> go<00:04:22.919> ahead<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
as you can see pretty good in my opinion

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.810 
as you can see pretty good in my opinion
just<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:43.990> good<00:04:44.169> as<00:04:44.320> Siri<00:04:44.650> although<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.669> one

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
just as good as Siri although the one

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.730 
just as good as Siri although the one
thing<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.090> have<00:04:46.240> noticed<00:04:46.419> is<00:04:46.690> it's<00:04:46.840> not<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.350> if

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
thing I have noticed is it's not like if

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.909 
thing I have noticed is it's not like if
I<00:04:48.130> say<00:04:48.480> tell<00:04:49.480> me<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.630> joke<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:50.350> know<00:04:50.380> tell<00:04:50.800> me<00:04:50.889> a

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
I say tell me a joke you know tell me a

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.830 
I say tell me a joke you know tell me a
joke<00:04:50.980> oh<00:04:54.720> whoops

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
joke oh whoops

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.150 
joke oh whoops
tell<00:04:56.800> me<00:04:56.919> a<00:04:56.950> joke<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:02.110> google<00:05:02.590> searches<00:05:03.010> it

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
tell me a joke it google searches it

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.740 
tell me a joke it google searches it
won't<00:05:03.520> actually<00:05:03.729> tell<00:05:04.090> me<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> joke

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
won't actually tell me a joke

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.060 
won't actually tell me a joke
so<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.520> mean<00:05:07.200> some<00:05:08.200> of<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.380> is<00:05:08.560> just<00:05:08.590> less

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
so I mean some of this is just less

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.800 
so I mean some of this is just less
human-like<00:05:09.700> in<00:05:09.910> my<00:05:10.000> opinion<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.419> voice<00:05:10.600> is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
human-like in my opinion the voice is

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.409 
human-like in my opinion the voice is
better<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.110> think<00:05:11.290> less<00:05:11.770> robotic<00:05:12.340> but<00:05:12.550> other

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
better I think less robotic but other

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.480 
better I think less robotic but other
than<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:13.810> though<00:05:14.020> it's<00:05:14.290> it's<00:05:14.500> just<00:05:14.620> it's<00:05:15.400> a

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
than that though it's it's just it's a

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.400 
than that though it's it's just it's a
good<00:05:15.639> feature<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:16.090> have<00:05:16.270> another<00:05:17.020> thing<00:05:17.290> I've

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
good feature to have another thing I've

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.590 
good feature to have another thing I've
notice<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.919> in<00:05:18.160> Netflix<00:05:18.760> I've<00:05:19.270> noticed

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
notice is in Netflix I've noticed

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.659 
notice is in Netflix I've noticed
Netflix<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.260> lot<00:05:20.560> less<00:05:20.800> laggy<00:05:21.100> than<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.520> was

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
Netflix is a lot less laggy than it was

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.800 
Netflix is a lot less laggy than it was
in<00:05:22.979> Ice<00:05:23.979> Cream<00:05:24.310> Sandwich<00:05:24.510> now<00:05:25.510> this<00:05:25.660> could

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
in Ice Cream Sandwich now this could

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.129 
in Ice Cream Sandwich now this could
have<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:25.960> been<00:05:26.229> on<00:05:26.350> here<00:05:26.740> on<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.669> TF<00:05:28.000> 300<00:05:28.479> but

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
have just been on here on the TF 300 but

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.940 
have just been on here on the TF 300 but
either<00:05:29.440> way<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:30.820> think<00:05:31.390> it's<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.870> big<00:05:32.350> difference

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
either way I think it's a big difference

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.510 
either way I think it's a big difference
I<00:05:34.410> mean<00:05:35.410> hold<00:05:35.740> on<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.039> go<00:05:38.039> scroll<00:05:39.039> down<00:05:39.220> here

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
I mean hold on and go scroll down here

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520 
I mean hold on and go scroll down here
so<00:05:40.390> as<00:05:40.510> you<00:05:40.600> can<00:05:40.720> see<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:43.690> still<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.229> little

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
so as you can see it's still a little

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.110 
so as you can see it's still a little
choppy<00:05:44.860> sometimes<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.960> viewing<00:05:47.530> viewing

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
choppy sometimes but viewing viewing

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.490 
choppy sometimes but viewing viewing
content<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.210> Netflix<00:05:49.690> is<00:05:50.100> pretty<00:05:51.100> smooth

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
content on Netflix is pretty smooth

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.080 
content on Netflix is pretty smooth
haven't<00:05:53.500> had<00:05:53.590> any<00:05:53.800> problems<00:05:54.250> with<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.580> quality

haven't had any problems with it quality
is<00:05:55.330> decent<00:05:59.070> so<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.729> can<00:06:00.940> tell<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:02.550> just<00:06:03.550> noticed

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.029 
is decent so you can tell I just noticed
it's<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.090> lot<00:06:04.270> smoother<00:06:04.720> than<00:06:04.900> before<00:06:05.500> so

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
it's a lot smoother than before so

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.500 
it's a lot smoother than before so

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
jellybean is the recent apps when you

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.650 
jellybean is the recent apps when you
swipe<00:06:13.900> off<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.260> screen<00:06:14.530> it's<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:14.919> lot<00:06:15.100> quicker

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
swipe off the screen it's a lot quicker

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.510 
swipe off the screen it's a lot quicker
you<00:06:16.660> need<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.810> see<00:06:16.990> they<00:06:17.350> just<00:06:17.380> shoot<00:06:17.860> off<00:06:18.130> the

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
you need to see they just shoot off the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.719 
you need to see they just shoot off the
screen<00:06:18.820> which<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.479> really<00:06:19.750> like<00:06:19.960> about<00:06:19.990> it

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
screen which I really like about it

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.020 
screen which I really like about it
this<00:06:21.729> makes<00:06:22.120> it<00:06:22.240> feel<00:06:22.419> a<00:06:22.479> lot<00:06:22.840> snappier<00:06:24.030> and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
this makes it feel a lot snappier and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.340 
this makes it feel a lot snappier and
performance<00:06:25.600> wise<00:06:25.810> it's<00:06:26.260> just<00:06:26.500> really<00:06:27.400> good

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
performance wise it's just really good

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.440
