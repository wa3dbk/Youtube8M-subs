00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
alpha footage of gameplay I believe that

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.340 
alpha footage of gameplay I believe that
is<00:01:26.700> pre-rendered<00:01:27.240> cutscenes<00:01:27.270> yeah<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> looked

is pre-rendered cutscenes yeah it looked

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
is pre-rendered cutscenes yeah it looked
like<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.800> too<00:01:29.039> it's<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.940> good<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.420> read

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
like it it's too it's really good I read

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.010 
like it it's too it's really good I read
for<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:32.280> early<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.759> game<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.690> think

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
for this early in the game so I do think

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
for this early in the game so I do think
that's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> cutscene<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.710> mean<00:01:34.920> us<00:01:35.429> often

he<00:04:51.660> died<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.350> cholera<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.190> mean<00:04:53.490> wrist<00:04:53.760> blaze<00:04:54.800> so

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
he died of cholera I mean wrist blaze so

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.010 
he died of cholera I mean wrist blaze so
what<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:56.909> looks<00:04:57.240> like<00:04:57.479> at<00:04:57.690> least<00:04:57.720> at<00:04:57.990> first

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
what it looks like at least at first

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.990 
what it looks like at least at first
glance<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.190> assassins<00:04:59.729> will<00:04:59.880> be

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
glance is that the assassins will be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.580 
glance is that the assassins will be
represented<00:05:00.630> by<00:05:00.659> the<00:05:01.260> Rev

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
represented by the Rev

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.820 
represented by the Rev
Nerys<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.090> nobility<00:05:03.690> will<00:05:03.930> occupy

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
Nerys and that the nobility will occupy

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.030 
Nerys and that the nobility will occupy
like<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> Templar<00:05:06.380> what<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.410> really<00:05:07.800> liked

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
like the Templar what I really liked

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.340 
like the Templar what I really liked
about<00:05:08.190> assassins<00:05:08.850> creed<00:05:09.060> 3<00:05:09.330> was<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.600> like<00:05:10.170> the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
about assassins creed 3 was the like the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.770 
about assassins creed 3 was the like the
ambiguity<00:05:11.130> between<00:05:11.280> whose<00:05:11.790> side<00:05:12.120> overlapped

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
ambiguity between whose side overlapped

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.810 
ambiguity between whose side overlapped
with<00:05:12.960> what<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.980> Templars<00:05:14.370> weren't

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
with what the Templars weren't

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.070 
with what the Templars weren't
necessarily<00:05:15.330> British<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.020> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
necessarily British and the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.360 
necessarily British and the
revolutionaries<00:05:16.680> weren't<00:05:16.920> necessarily

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
revolutionaries weren't necessarily

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
ways I get to be a little gray as to who

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.910 
ways I get to be a little gray as to who
is<00:05:27.690> right<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:27.930> who<00:05:28.080> was<00:05:28.140> wrong<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:28.710> who<00:05:28.800> was

is right and who was wrong and who was
on<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.070> right<00:05:29.220> side<00:05:29.400> who's<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.820> wrong

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
on the right side who's on the wrong

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.300 
on the right side who's on the wrong
side<00:05:30.240> I'm<00:05:30.450> wondering<00:05:30.930> how<00:05:31.560> that<00:05:31.620> will<00:05:32.130> tie

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
side I'm wondering how that will tie

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.550 
side I'm wondering how that will tie
into<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.820> French<00:05:33.330> Revolution<00:05:33.540> because<00:05:34.230> for
