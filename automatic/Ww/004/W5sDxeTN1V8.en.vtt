00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.319
 the new apple macbook is betting 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.819
 a notebook even thinner than a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.890
 11 inch macbook air with a screen 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.120
 retina 12 inches and connectivity 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.800
 minimized 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 since it is equipped with a single USB port 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.910
 this is the future of computers 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 laptops or an ultrabook are suffering 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.090
 still too much compromise to be 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.150
 really attractive doing the point everything 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 right away with the pluses and the minuses 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 the first thing that jumps in the eyes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 with this new macbook is its finesse 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.789
 count 1 3 cm thick it's still 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.949
 a little less than the 1.7 cm of the macbook 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 air 11 inches and the weight goes hand in hand 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.149
 weighs only 9 122 g on our balance 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.590
 the space is perfectly optimized the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 borders around the screen are reduced 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 at a minimum and the keyboard occupies the entire 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 frame width beautiful work 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.860
 integration 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 the macbook is the first laptop not 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 apple pro to equip a screen 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 retina 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.410
 the manufacturer rarely disappoints us on 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 the quality of these slabs and that of this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.860
 macbook is no exception to the rule 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.750
 the colors are just the angles of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 vision are perfect and lamination 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 mitigates significantly without removing them 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 reflections and the macbook integrates the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 trackpad force touch already encountered on 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 the last maggie pro 13 inches this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 new trackpad always so nice 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 to use integrates a haptic feedback 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 which perfectly simulates a physical click 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.610
 and manages multiple levels of pressure at 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 the way of a device trigger 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.729
 photo uses are still few 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.409
 many but this technology of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.580
 mechanical products is promising and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.110
 especially allows to have a click 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.590
 distributed over the entire surface of the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.630
 trackpad 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.810
 we finally appreciate the presence of a ssd 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.460
 256 gigabytes and 8 gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.390
 on the base model while apple is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 often too fair in his 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.259
 configurations the ssd also holds 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 its promises at the level of flow without 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 reach those of the macbook pro 13 inches 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.180
 he clearly benefits from his collection 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.070
 in pci express apple bet on the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.659
 new usb connection is a choice 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 relevant by the fineness of the connector 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.780
 and its reversible side but 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.880
 unfortunately several problems 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.649
 first pose the ecosystem usd it's 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 currently nonexistent and requires 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.250
 so systematically to go through a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.549
 adapter that is not provided in the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.140
 box 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.700
 the other problem is that there is only one 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.560
 only port one can not load his 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 laptop and connect a hard drive or 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 a usb key at the same time without passing 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.110
 by an adapter to 90 euros and on the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.820
 technical plan the macbook is the first 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580
 portable apple has integrated a processor 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.319
 intel core and hand this one does not require 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.030
 no cooling thanks to its weak 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.970
 thermal envelope but it is paid by 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.290
 an annoying heater 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.270
 under the laptop in heavy tasks 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.070
 and especially by a frequency that has 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.780
 tendency to fall when the temperature 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.580
 climbs beyond a certain threshold 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.020
 we will obviously not seek to use 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.950
 this macbook to mount in case of case 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.360
 in final cut pro 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.730
 but you have to know that he also 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.470
 less powerful than a macbook finally air 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.180
 the keyboard and its butterfly mechanism is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.830
 a beautiful feat of integration but 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.720
 turns out to be less comfortable 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.860
 used a macbook air or pro especially 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.870
 to enter long texts 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.640
 unlike the trackpad force touch on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.350
 here feels that it is a compromise that apple 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.110
 had to operate to be able to integrate his 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.760
 keyboard on a chassis as hungry as 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.170
 the macbook air out the macbook 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.730
 will be really interesting in a 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 generation or two the time that apple has 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.580
 the time to correct these defects the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.260
 more troublesome we like the prowess 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.610
 integration and portability but 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.990
 this first generation has yet to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 to compromise too much on 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.270
 performance and connectivity to be 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.270
 really attractive
