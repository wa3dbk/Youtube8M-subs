00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
gotta find the right breaking spot here

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.449 
gotta find the right breaking spot here
for<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.240> turns<00:02:06.770> they're<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> bit<00:02:07.979> more<00:02:08.190> wide

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
for these turns they're a bit more wide

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
for these turns they're a bit more wide
open<00:02:08.910> than<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.179> were<00:02:09.300> last<00:02:09.330> year<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.170> even

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
open than they were last year so even

open than they were last year so even
more<00:02:13.650> flow<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.520> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
more flow into it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.970 
more flow into it
ah<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:17.030> good<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:18.140> look<00:02:18.439> at<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.799> they

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
ah this is good and look at how they
