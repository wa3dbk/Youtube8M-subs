00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.490
 which is essential for each 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.880
 this jersey of the France team who 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.340
 must be above all 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.270
 you are in your different clubs 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 you can see it 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 and it makes sense some truth 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.330
 to see a fear of equality a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.140
 France team there is nothing that can 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.259
 to be seen and this riddle 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 and there she is always indispensable and 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.040
 it's okay 2 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.040
 the sukuk 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.250
 maybe maybe his first 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 selection to be aware that you 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.810
 are privileged compared to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.900
 all the others who are sick and get 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.420
 deprive snow you have to give the time to 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.380
 Damask care 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 nation in life after the result 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.510
 for the know as well as me it's 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.390
 sometimes at war he 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 maple and in this unit it's a 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.399
 feed 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.980
 to do things together versus 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.620
 the 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.960
 the board with this championship in the month of 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 July he 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.720
 two dates I was well aware 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 thank you guys so have benefited well 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.030
 paid 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.110
 canned that each time it is a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 privilege I have them 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.450
 it will be the last 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 also that I'm hoping for but 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.510
 it's something that has to be strong 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.910
 and that tends to unite you in the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.050
 difficulty by happiness because there is 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.440
 moments of happiness too 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.600
 but it will never ever be overused 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.780
 isabeau was always present in 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 the spirit of good match shopping and good 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.220
 results obviously this is it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.380
 more important but I knew 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.380
 and a supporter is in the front row 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.090
 when I'm in training and matches 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.130
 now even the matches of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 championship who are who are televised 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.539
 so yes I'm looking at 2.9 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.489
 curious denain but 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 it is true that there is a very 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.280
 important internal 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 quality of intensity game that's it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 that's where we realize that the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 level that the team of France 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.069
 today has become very interesting 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.069
 at European and global level
