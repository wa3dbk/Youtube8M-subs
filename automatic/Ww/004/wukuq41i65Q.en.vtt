00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
just make up Sonia there go feeling this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.540 
just make up Sonia there go feeling this
is<00:00:24.029> Victorian<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.369> ok<00:00:26.369> badly<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.449> pitted<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
is Victorian but ok badly is pitted and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
is Victorian but ok badly is pitted and
can't<00:00:29.550> even<00:00:29.760> make<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.150> head<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
can't even make our head there but I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.620 
can't even make our head there but I
presume<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.520> will<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.759> Victorian<00:00:35.450> now<00:00:36.450> I'll

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
presume it will be Victorian now I'll

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680 
presume it will be Victorian now I'll
carry<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.640> typical<00:00:38.640> don't<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.120> anything<00:00:39.390> for

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
carry on typical don't find anything for

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860 
carry on typical don't find anything for
a<00:00:39.719> couple<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> hours<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.600> when<00:00:42.600> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a couple of hours and then to when just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
a couple of hours and then to when just
moved<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.590> five<00:00:43.920> meters<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> last

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
moved what five meters from the last

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.440 
moved what five meters from the last
corner<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:45.870> another<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:47.450> coughing

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
corner and there's another one coughing

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
corner and there's another one coughing
this<00:00:48.600> one's<00:00:48.840> probably<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.770> Georgian<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this one's probably more Georgian but

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.619 
this one's probably more Georgian but
again<00:00:51.949> more<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> blank<00:00:53.520> disc<00:00:53.820> than<00:00:54.180> anything

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
again more of a blank disc than anything

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680 
again more of a blank disc than anything
I<00:00:55.100> think<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.699> doesn't<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.390> make

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
I think on one side doesn't just make

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
I think on one side doesn't just make
out<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.609> plutonium<00:00:59.609> preps<00:01:00.079> I'm<00:01:01.079> cleaning<00:01:01.770> run

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
out the plutonium preps I'm cleaning run

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
out the plutonium preps I'm cleaning run
a<00:01:02.010> wire<00:01:02.309> brush<00:01:02.640> turn<00:01:03.059> over<00:01:03.329> L<00:01:03.840> might<00:01:04.140> make

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a wire brush turn over L might make

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.719 
a wire brush turn over L might make
something<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:06.260> anyway<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:08.369> keep<00:01:08.670> going

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
something out anyway now keep going

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.020 
something out anyway now keep going
practice<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.010> as<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.250> looks<00:01:11.490> picking<00:01:11.880> up

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
practice more now as we looks picking up

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.149 
practice more now as we looks picking up
oh<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:13.619> never<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.780> persevering<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
oh I never go on about persevering and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.140 
oh I never go on about persevering and
keeping<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.540> there<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
keeping going there you go up in

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
keeping going there you go up in
