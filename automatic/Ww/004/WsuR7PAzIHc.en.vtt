just jump right into it the talents you
want<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> use<00:00:39.950> it's<00:00:40.950> basically<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.580> to<00:00:41.760> you

want to use it's basically up to you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.900 
want to use it's basically up to you
depending<00:00:42.630> on<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.350> doing<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
instance if you are mainly tanking

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
instance if you are mainly tanking
heroics<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.190> strongly<00:00:47.460> suggest

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
heroics that would strongly suggest

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.690 
heroics that would strongly suggest
morbidity<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.750> give<00:00:49.080> threat<00:00:49.350> easier<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:50.580> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
morbidity to give threat easier if you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
morbidity to give threat easier if you
are<00:00:50.880> rate<00:00:51.090> tanking<00:00:51.630> it<00:00:51.870> depends<00:00:52.470> but<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.100> find

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
are rate tanking it depends but I find

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.190 
are rate tanking it depends but I find
endless<00:00:53.850> winter<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.540> great<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.080> I'm

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
endless winter very great because I'm

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.080 
endless winter very great because I'm
doing<00:00:55.350> interrupts<00:00:55.830> all<00:00:55.950> the<00:00:56.040> time<00:00:56.190> because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
doing interrupts all the time because

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.040 
doing interrupts all the time because
everybody<00:00:57.630> else<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> too<00:00:57.990> lazy<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.470> it<00:00:58.590> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
everybody else is too lazy to do it and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
everybody else is too lazy to do it and
in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.200> blood<00:01:01.380> tree<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.829> basically<00:01:02.370> it's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
in the blood tree it's basically it's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
in the blood tree it's basically it's
very<00:01:03.500> self-explanatory<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.670> what

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
very self-explanatory just use what

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.249 
very self-explanatory just use what
feels<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.329> if<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:06.750> struggling<00:01:07.049> with

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
threat take blood cake plate if you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
threat take blood cake plate if you
don't<00:01:09.750> find<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.079> an<00:01:10.200> issue<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.799> fix

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
don't find that an issue you know fix

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.590 
don't find that an issue you know fix
something<00:01:11.369> else<00:01:11.899> just<00:01:12.899> feel<00:01:13.289> what<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.069> know

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
something else just feel what you know

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
something else just feel what you know
feels<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.740> test<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
feels right for you and just test it and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.590 
feels right for you and just test it and
find<00:01:18.509> something<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.859> because<00:01:20.700> as

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
find something that you like because as

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.379 
find something that you like because as
with<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:21.929> tanking<00:01:22.590> classes<00:01:23.039> there<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.429> very

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:24.389 
with all tanking classes there are very

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.959 
with all tanking classes there are very
hard<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.749> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.020> min<00:01:25.409> max<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.979> optimum<00:01:26.729> spec

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
hard to you know min max a optimum spec

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.450 
hard to you know min max a optimum spec
like<00:01:27.359> it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.289> many<00:01:28.530> dps<00:01:29.539> trees

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
like it is for you know many dps trees

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.040 
like it is for you know many dps trees
and<00:01:31.640> glyphs<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.720> very<00:01:33.590> much<00:01:33.950> also<00:01:35.050> pretty

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
and glyphs is very much also pretty

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.380 
and glyphs is very much also pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.890> for<00:01:37.430> prime<00:01:37.730> glyphs<00:01:37.970> you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
straightforward for prime glyphs you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.760 
straightforward for prime glyphs you
can't<00:01:38.690> go<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:38.990> anything<00:01:39.170> else<00:01:39.410> and<00:01:39.650> these

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
can't go in anything else and these

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.410 
can't go in anything else and these
basically<00:01:41.110> -<00:01:42.110> or<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:43.250> might<00:01:43.790> want<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.240> take

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
basically - or you might want to take

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.660 
basically - or you might want to take
cliff<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.840> Defen<00:01:45.110> decay<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.830> would<00:01:46.520> not

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
cliff a Defen decay but I would not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.160 
cliff a Defen decay but I would not
suggest<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:47.570> only<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:47.990> you're

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
suggest that that's only if you're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.430 
suggest that that's only if you're
really<00:01:48.410> struggling<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.070> AoE<00:01:49.700> threat

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
really struggling with AoE threat

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440 
really struggling with AoE threat
there<00:01:52.130> are<00:01:52.280> rather<00:01:52.580> boring<00:01:52.850> because

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
there are rather boring because

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.180 
there are rather boring because
everything<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.530> threats<00:01:55.690> boosters<00:01:56.690> so

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
everything is just threats boosters so

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.020 
everything is just threats boosters so
uh<00:01:58.190> yeah<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.119> the<00:02:00.250> major<00:02:01.250> glyphs<00:02:01.640> are<00:02:01.910> more

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
uh yeah and the major glyphs are more

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.580 
uh yeah and the major glyphs are more
interesting<00:02:02.510> but<00:02:02.900> I<00:02:02.960> also<00:02:03.320> pretty

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
interesting but I also pretty

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.880 
interesting but I also pretty
straightforward<00:02:04.420> these<00:02:05.420> three<00:02:05.899> are<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.170> main

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
straightforward these three are the main

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.969 
straightforward these three are the main
you<00:02:07.490> know<00:02:07.520> survivability<00:02:08.270> major<00:02:08.929> glyphs<00:02:09.290> if

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
you know survivability major glyphs if

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.979 
you know survivability major glyphs if
you<00:02:10.130> want<00:02:10.310> some<00:02:10.580> more<00:02:10.759> AV<00:02:11.150> capabilities<00:02:11.810> I

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
you want some more AV capabilities I

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.470 
you want some more AV capabilities I
suggest<00:02:12.470> with<00:02:12.709> pestilence<00:02:13.459> or<00:02:13.700> blood<00:02:14.270> boil

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
suggest with pestilence or blood boil

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.380 
suggest with pestilence or blood boil
but<00:02:15.200> uh<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.860> don't<00:02:16.310> find<00:02:16.520> those<00:02:16.670> necessary<00:02:17.209> and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but uh I don't find those necessary and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.570 
but uh I don't find those necessary and
often<00:02:17.930> they<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.290> break<00:02:18.620> crowd<00:02:18.920> control<00:02:19.340> and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
often they just break crowd control and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.830 
often they just break crowd control and
necessary<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.890> might<00:02:22.670> be<00:02:22.940> good<00:02:23.450> too<00:02:23.630> but

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
necessary and that might be good too but

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.199 
necessary and that might be good too but
I<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.520> I'm<00:02:25.520> cool<00:02:25.880> with<00:02:26.030> Ally

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I I I'm cool with Ally

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.540 
I I I'm cool with Ally
yeah<00:02:29.209> good<00:02:29.450> for<00:02:29.480> vampiric<00:02:29.959> blood<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:31.280> very

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
yeah good for vampiric blood is very

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.580 
yeah good for vampiric blood is very
nice<00:02:31.700> considering<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.690> stamina<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.290> no

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
nice considering that stamina is no
