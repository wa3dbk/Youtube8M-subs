really important to add the dry
ingredients<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.730> batches<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.510> don't<00:02:01.720> get

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
ingredients in batches so you don't get

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.510 
ingredients in batches so you don't get
a<00:02:01.960> dry<00:02:02.410> crumbly<00:02:03.220> cookie

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 

now<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.960> tell<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.409> done<00:02:07.710> because

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
now I can tell that it's done because

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.469 
now I can tell that it's done because
all<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> ingredients<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:09.090> combined

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
all the ingredients have combined

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.839
