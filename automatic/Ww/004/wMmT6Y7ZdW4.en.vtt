show you how to clean your brushes
cleaning<00:00:07.710> your<00:00:07.830> brushes<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.280> really

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
cleaning your brushes is really

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.220 
cleaning your brushes is really
important<00:00:08.970> as<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.300> probably<00:00:09.510> know<00:00:09.809> because

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
important as you probably know because

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.930 
important as you probably know because
they<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.800> really<00:00:11.010> dirty<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.639> don't<00:00:11.820> want

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
they get really dirty and you don't want

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.549 
they get really dirty and you don't want
to<00:00:12.000> keep<00:00:12.090> using<00:00:12.269> dirty<00:00:12.630> brushes<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.349> face

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
to keep using dirty brushes on your face

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.020 
to keep using dirty brushes on your face
because<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.190> cause<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.549> break<00:00:14.730> out

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
because that can cause you to break out

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
because that can cause you to break out
on<00:00:15.210> all<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> things<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.809> now<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> way

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
on all the things like that now the way

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200 
on all the things like that now the way
that<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> isn't<00:00:17.460> necessarily<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
that I do it isn't necessarily the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.849 
that I do it isn't necessarily the
easiest<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.710> by

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
easiest way because you can just by

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.920 
easiest way because you can just by
cleaning<00:00:20.550> sprays<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.270> really<00:00:21.480> easy<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> just

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
cleaning sprays that really easy to just

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.599 
cleaning sprays that really easy to just
spray<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.170> after<00:00:22.619> each<00:00:22.680> time<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> use<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.279> so

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
spray on after each time you use it so

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.130 
spray on after each time you use it so
this<00:00:23.939> may<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.300> something<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> do

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this may not be something that you do

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
this may not be something that you do
every<00:00:25.170> single<00:00:25.650> time<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.640> brushes

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
every single time you use your brushes

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.370 
every single time you use your brushes
but<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.570> thing<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.930> every<00:00:28.109> couple

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
but it's a good thing to do every couple

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
but it's a good thing to do every couple
of<00:00:28.619> weeks<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.670> doing<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.060> way

really good you can probably get this at

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.970

any<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.699> street<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.239> drugstore<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.770> next

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
any high street or drugstore the next

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
any high street or drugstore the next
thing<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.280> need<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.520> extra<00:00:57.059> virgin<00:00:57.210> olive

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
thing they need is extra virgin olive

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
thing they need is extra virgin olive
oil<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> condition<00:00:59.489> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
oil this is just to condition your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
oil this is just to condition your
brushes<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> leave<00:01:00.449> them<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.870> softer<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
brushes and leave them bit softer and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.080 
brushes and leave them bit softer and
that's<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> baby<00:01:02.340> shampoo<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.910> gonna

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that's because the baby shampoo is gonna

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's because the baby shampoo is gonna
strip<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.899> brushes<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> net

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
strip the brushes a bit so the net

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
strip the brushes a bit so the net
extra-virgin<00:01:05.610> olive<00:01:05.640> oil<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.270> makes<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
extra-virgin olive oil just makes them a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
extra-virgin olive oil just makes them a
bit<00:01:06.780> softer<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.439> dry<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.100> going

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220

quite a lot just because I do have a lot
of<00:01:17.909> brushes<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.930> cleaning

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
brushes so that's probably the amount

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
brushes so that's probably the amount
that<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.549> will<00:01:23.850> use<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.540> I'll<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:24.960> the

extra virgin olive oil and just add in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.200 
extra virgin olive oil and just add in
these<00:01:27.930> squirts<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.060> know

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
these squirts of that I don't even know

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
probably play it by eye and just see how

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
probably play it by eye and just see how
many<00:01:37.710> brushes<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> clean<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
many brushes you're going to clean and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
many brushes you're going to clean and
just<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:40.290> clean<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> amount

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
just see if this will clean that amount

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.370 
just see if this will clean that amount
that<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.670> another<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that you have another thing I like to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
that you have another thing I like to
add<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> mixture<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.430> optional

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
add into the mixture which is optional

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.920 
add into the mixture which is optional
is<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:46.340> antibacterial<00:01:47.340> gel<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is them antibacterial gel this is just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
is them antibacterial gel this is just
because<00:01:49.229> baby<00:01:49.890> shampoo<00:01:50.100> isn't<00:01:50.640> antibacterial

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
because baby shampoo isn't antibacterial

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
because baby shampoo isn't antibacterial
so<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> completely<00:01:53.880> kill
