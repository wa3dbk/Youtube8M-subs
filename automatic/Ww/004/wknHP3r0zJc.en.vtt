00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.650 
taking a look at the otterbox defender
for<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> iphone<00:00:05.430> 5<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.299> comes<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.600> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
phone now these can be quite awkward to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.970 
phone now these can be quite awkward to
get<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> part<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.500> key<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
get the part but what the the key is is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
get the part but what the the key is is
if<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> pop<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.640> nail<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> side<00:00:27.359> there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
if you pop your nail on the side there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
if you pop your nail on the side there
there's<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> rim<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.609> don't

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
there's actually a rim and you don't

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
there's actually a rim and you don't
need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> pull<00:00:30.240> too<00:00:30.420> hard<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> will

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
need to pull too hard and it will

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
need to pull too hard and it will
actually<00:00:32.099> separate<00:00:32.700> sometimes<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> find

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
actually separate sometimes you find

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually separate sometimes you find
yourself<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:34.020> trying<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> pull<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
yourself actually trying to pull on that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.310 
yourself actually trying to pull on that
plastic<00:00:34.950> room<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.660> causes<00:00:37.079> most

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
plastic room which is what causes most

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.000 
plastic room which is what causes most
of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> issue<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.440> sue<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
of the issue so they can sue got that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
of the issue so they can sue got that
part<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.710> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
part so then what you have to do is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
part so then what you have to do is
separate<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.270> several<00:00:48.600> tabs<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
separate it with several tabs around it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
separate it with several tabs around it
which<00:00:50.129> lock<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.640> place<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.120> hold<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> case

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
which lock in place to hold the case

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.810 
which lock in place to hold the case
together<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> once<00:00:58.289> you've<00:00:58.440> actually

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
together so once you've actually

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
together so once you've actually
separated<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.449> stop<00:01:00.690> by<00:01:00.870> popping<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
separated it you stop by popping the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
separated it you stop by popping the
phone<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> front

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
phone in like that and you put the front

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
phone in like that and you put the front
plate<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.650> shirt<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.670> locks<00:01:05.939> back<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.330> using

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
plate on shirt with locks back on using

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.890 
plate on shirt with locks back on using
the<00:01:06.720> clips<00:01:06.960> you've<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.350> released<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the clips you've just released so as you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.090 
the clips you've just released so as you
can<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> building<00:01:10.830> screen

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
can see there's the building screen

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
can see there's the building screen
protector<00:01:11.700> you've<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> whole<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
protector you've got the the whole of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.480 
protector you've got the the whole of
the<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> piece<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the back there but there is a piece of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
the back there but there is a piece of
plastic<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> covering<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> actual

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
plastic over it covering the actual

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
plastic over it covering the actual
apple<00:01:16.830> logo<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> rubber

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
apple logo and then this is the rubber

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.679 
apple logo and then this is the rubber
shock<00:01:19.439> absorbing<00:01:19.979> pot<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.150> fit<00:01:21.570> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
shock absorbing pot so you just fit this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
shock absorbing pot so you just fit this
back<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.590> quite<00:01:22.770> fiddly<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
back on they are quite fiddly to get on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
back on they are quite fiddly to get on
but<00:01:23.820> obviously<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> protection<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:24.960> offer

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
but obviously the protection they offer

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.670 
but obviously the protection they offer
its<00:01:25.439> cert<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> worth<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> fit<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.690 

and<00:01:35.680> then<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:35.860> just<00:01:36.010> literally<00:01:36.250> word<00:01:36.520> around

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
and then you just literally word around

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.750 
and then you just literally word around
the<00:01:36.850> edges<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:38.280> once<00:01:39.280> you've<00:01:39.400> got<00:01:39.549> all<00:01:39.580> that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the edges here once you've got all that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.270 
the edges here once you've got all that
in<00:01:40.030> place<00:01:40.270> then<00:01:40.930> you're<00:01:41.080> finally<00:01:41.409> done<00:01:41.650> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
in place then you're finally done the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.730 
in place then you're finally done the
little<00:01:42.520> plastic<00:01:42.670> parts<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.450> cover<00:01:44.320> here<00:01:44.590> you

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
little plastic parts that cover here you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.350 
little plastic parts that cover here you
got<00:01:44.890> access<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.490> silence<00:01:45.909> which<00:01:46.090> through

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
got access to the silence which through

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.109 
got access to the silence which through
there<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> little<00:01:47.170> awkward<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.650> get<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.159> but

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
there is a little awkward to get to but

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.460 
there is a little awkward to get to but
that<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.360> one<00:01:49.570> thing<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.990> at<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.229> level

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
that is one thing you get at this level

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.770 
that is one thing you get at this level
of<00:01:50.680> protection<00:01:50.830> as<00:01:51.759> your<00:01:52.030> volume<00:01:52.360> button<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:52.720> I
