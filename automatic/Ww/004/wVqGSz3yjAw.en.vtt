00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.349
 the best high-end android smartphone 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.840
 carcass is the best android smartphone 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.340
 the state c because in our opinion we 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.780
 we just explained in the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.070
 a category 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.099
 htc one just has a very nice one 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.570
 design super nice aluminum unibody 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.490
 which is really much better than the body of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.619
 the s4 as far as we are concerned 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.550
 vd we like the sense interface a bit 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.439
 better so sense is a bit tighter 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.609
 nicer, and simpler 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.470
 must be touch with from samsung us 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.120
 the chipset is a qualcomm 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.160
 snapdragon 600 ship 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.320
 2 gigabytes of ram memory device 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.960
 just super fast and works super well 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.370
 same as in the galaxy s4 by the way 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.410
 and nothing else we think the htc 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.629
 one does very well and that is the screen 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.559
 screen is a 4.7 inch super lc screen 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.079
 paragraph 3 screen 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.210
 super nice colors 1080 p yes d so too 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.949
 super sharp and we are really whole there 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.570
 very satisfied with the screen of the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.699
 galaxy s4 mini maybe just a little better 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.559
 but the difference is very small and 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.780
 the last point is the camera 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.800
 ultra pixel camera of nation of that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.430
 we find a little less than the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.160
 competition 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.960
 A4 megapixels that can still be 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.460
 the pixels are that big but with that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.870
 you just miss detail 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.090
 compared to the 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.110
 is in many competitors so that is 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.960
 Unfortunately 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.270
 so as far as we are concerned, c one wind is just leaving us 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.550
 in the field of design and after interface 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.290
 especially from the samsung galaxy s4 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.730
 therefore the best android smartphone 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.950
 respect us but they differ 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.660
 there is not good on windows of area 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.750
 I the best smartphone had the Nokia 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.130
 lumia 920 nokia lumia 920 is common 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.320
 functionally the best 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.450
 he is a bit rude and so big 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.890
 that is something you should be able to handle 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.600
 live in any case 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.340
 designer otherwise not bad it is 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.360
 just a nice sturdy unibody one 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.830
 nice color 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.050
 so safe to criticize him 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.730
 is therefore just very large lumia 920 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.990
 it just wins the functional of all 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.130
 other windows phones out there on this 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.010
 moment 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.050
 for example, he has wireless 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.730
 Charging built-in a screen with you with 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.100
 and can also wear gloves 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.530
 a nice 8 megapixel pureview camera 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.940
 to that pureview camera that made her 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.950
 just with good lighting conditions 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
 good photos don't make me very special 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.090
 when it gets dark then the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.090
 optical image stabilization that is going to be 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.500
 do the work 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.180
 therefore the shutter speed can be adjusted as usual 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
 be taller and therefore he does 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.120
 very beautiful big star we really have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.200
 very much impressed during the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760
 test period 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.530
 city ​​is a good function for a whole year 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.849
 of these lumia 920 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.890
 further in terms of screen, it is just whole 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.540
 good via a half-inch and 720 p hd 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.160
 screen processor that is in it and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 ram memory are all things like that 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.120
 similar to other windows phones 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.940
 so that does not excel but in terms of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.209
 functions with additional functions is lumia 920 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 justifiably the best on iphone 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.959
 It is of course clear which 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.099
 best is the iphone 5s 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.269
 newest iphone 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.340
 and therefore simply the best 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.280
 iphone that small assortment that i 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.019
 apple has the iphone 5 that is 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.640
 for example, improved in its processor 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.920
 which is much faster and the screen that is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.150
 a bit bigger that is big 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.680
 benefit 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.030
 camera has become a bit better design it 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.590
 what has been overhauled and what us 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.360
 also a bit better with aluminum 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.790
 back so all those things are 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.810
 improved and with that the iphone 5 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.810
 simply the best iphone
