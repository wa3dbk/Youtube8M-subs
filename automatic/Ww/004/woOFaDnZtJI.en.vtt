00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
enough for these lights to go through

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.990 
enough for these lights to go through
it's<00:00:42.470> not<00:00:42.620> big<00:00:42.830> enough<00:00:42.860> for<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:43.340> entire<00:00:43.640> top

wire coming out and then there is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.380 
wire coming out and then there is
another<00:02:02.799> wire<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.580> runs<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.970> entire<00:02:04.060> length

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
another wire that runs the entire length

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
to keep the tube the two wires over here

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.319 
to keep the tube the two wires over here
to<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.840> wire<00:02:44.079> alright<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> we've<00:02:47.140> got<00:02:47.170> our

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
to the one wire alright so we've got our

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.210 
to the one wire alright so we've got our
single<00:02:49.329> wire<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:50.049> are<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.769> clip

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
single wire that we are going to clip

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.800 
single wire that we are going to clip
right<00:02:51.609> now<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:56.560> cover<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.540> bit

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
right now and then cover up with a bit

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.290 
right now and then cover up with a bit
of<00:02:58.900> electrical<00:02:59.440> tape

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.450 

I'm<00:03:06.870> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.470> use<00:03:07.710> two<00:03:08.040> pieces<00:03:08.430> of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
I'm going to use two pieces of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.880 
I'm going to use two pieces of
electrical<00:03:09.030> tape<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:10.230> keep<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.680> well

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
electrical tape to keep this well

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:22.649 
electrical tape to keep this well
covered

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.600 

we'll<00:03:23.659> notice<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.049> there<00:03:24.890> are<00:03:25.129> two<00:03:25.400> wires

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
we'll notice that there are two wires

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.119 
we'll notice that there are two wires
going<00:03:25.939> into<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.450> top<00:03:26.689> bulb<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.290> for<00:03:27.950> all<00:03:28.040> the

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
going into the top bulb and for all the

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.800 
going into the top bulb and for all the
other<00:03:28.280> bulbs<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:28.970> wire<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.599> one

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
other bulbs is one wire going in one

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.460 
other bulbs is one wire going in one
wire<00:03:30.019> coming<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.310> what<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:31.849> will<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.780> we

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
wire coming out so what we will do is we

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.410 
wire coming out so what we will do is we
need<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.579> then<00:03:34.909> there's<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.239> wire<00:03:35.390> that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
need to and then there's one wire that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.360 
need to and then there's one wire that
also<00:03:35.870> runs<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> length<00:03:36.409> all<00:03:36.860> right<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.220> we've

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
also runs the length all right so we've

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.309 
also runs the length all right so we've
already<00:03:37.519> clipped<00:03:37.790> off<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.239> one<00:03:38.420> wire<00:03:38.720> that

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
already clipped off the one wire that

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.970 
already clipped off the one wire that
runs<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.670> length<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:41.120> does<00:03:41.329> not<00:03:41.540> connect<00:03:42.019> to

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
runs the length and does not connect to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.030 
runs the length and does not connect to
the<00:03:43.220> top<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.209> Christmas<00:03:44.900> lights<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.920> now

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
the top of the Christmas lights so now

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.890 
the top of the Christmas lights so now
we<00:03:46.099> are<00:03:46.310> going<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.180> one<00:03:47.360> that<00:03:47.569> connects

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
we are going to do the one that connects

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.630 
we are going to do the one that connects
from<00:03:48.349> wire<00:03:48.590> from<00:03:48.980> Christmas<00:03:49.400> light<00:03:49.519> to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
from wire from Christmas light to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.660 
from wire from Christmas light to
Christmas<00:03:49.940> light<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.049> want<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.890> make<00:03:52.099> my<00:03:52.400> top

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
so now I'm going to clip this wire here

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.809 
so now I'm going to clip this wire here
this<00:04:06.079> one<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.769> know<00:04:06.829> this<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.220> goes<00:04:07.400> from<00:04:07.519> light

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
this one I know this one goes from light

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.309 
this one I know this one goes from light
to<00:04:08.000> light<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.750> I'm<00:04:08.840> going<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.049> look<00:04:09.170> for

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
to light so I'm going to look for

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.140 
to light so I'm going to look for
another<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:10.250> other<00:04:10.400> wire<00:04:10.639> that<00:04:10.849> goes<00:04:11.000> from

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
another the other wire that goes from

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.340 
another the other wire that goes from
light<00:04:11.389> to<00:04:11.510> light<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.560> cut<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.040> right<00:04:13.250> here

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.659 

okay<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.620> now<00:04:18.889> I'm<00:04:18.949> going<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.160> splice<00:04:19.400> these

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
okay and now I'm going to splice these

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:45.200 
okay and now I'm going to splice these
two<00:04:20.120> wires<00:04:21.019> together

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.540 

and<00:04:45.720> I'm<00:04:46.080> going<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.410> tape<00:04:46.860> them<00:04:47.070> up<00:04:47.100> with

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
and I'm going to tape them up with

00:04:47.550 --> 00:05:08.370 
and I'm going to tape them up with
electrical<00:04:48.120> tape

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.740 

now<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> have<00:05:09.490> unraveled<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:10.120> second<00:05:10.570> wire

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
now I have unraveled the second wire

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.800 
now I have unraveled the second wire
that<00:05:11.560> goes<00:05:11.800> into<00:05:12.070> our<00:05:12.250> top<00:05:12.850> plug<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.450> I<00:05:13.600> will

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
that goes into our top plug and I will

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.290 
that goes into our top plug and I will
clip<00:05:14.260> that<00:05:14.500> wire<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.160> then<00:05:15.610> reconnect<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.270> to

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
clip that wire and then reconnect it to

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.780 
clip that wire and then reconnect it to
our<00:05:16.510> top<00:05:16.690> plug

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:35.320 

now<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.390> will<00:05:26.630> splice<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.140> wires

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.330 

and<00:05:36.250> join<00:05:37.250> them<00:05:37.460> together<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:39.500> I'll<00:05:39.680> put<00:05:40.039> some

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
and join them together and I'll put some

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:58.879 
and join them together and I'll put some
electrical<00:05:41.060> tape

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.320 

so<00:05:59.430> now<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.669> top<00:05:59.969> plug<00:06:01.129> is<00:06:02.129> still<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.150> top

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
so now the top plug is still the top

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.770
