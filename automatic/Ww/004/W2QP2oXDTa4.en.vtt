00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.799
 in many industries and in 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.240
 fans find their way of life 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.460
 fans are designed to cool 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.170
 airing equipment 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.360
 blue create flow directional 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.279
 air mass to destination 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.570
 fans are divided into proper 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.279
 fans and cooler and 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.590
 fan 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.570
 united heat exchanger by 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.700
 fan designs are divided into 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.619
 axial axial radial 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.870
 centrifugal and diametrical 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.000
 tangential in a nutshell about 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.070
 fan designs fan 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 is a fixed mouth 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.180
 on it in a certain way blades 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.520
 located in metal or 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.440
 plastic frame case which 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.780
 simultaneously performs the function of a tunnel 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.090
 8x fans and is also 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.519
 frame size 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.589
 determine the size of the fan thickness 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.809
 The frame length of the tunnel determines 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.910
 Fan performance that is 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.499
 the thicker the fan , the higher it is 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.900
 performance other things being equal 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.120
 parameters as opposed to axial 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.070
 diametrical fan and blades 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.320
 squirrel cage 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.590
 centerless rotor and vanes 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.020
 located along the periphery of the main 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 fan parameters first of all it 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.580
 overall dimensions of the fan 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.720
 defined frame 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.680
 Further supply voltage total constant 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.660
 or variable 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.370
 power consumption which can 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.110
 determine the maximum allowable 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.380
 operating current to avoid combustion 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.240
 fan and bearing type 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.820
 It should be noted that the type applied 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.570
 bearing noise level directly depends 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.080
 fan 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.180
 his working resource well and finally one of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.230
 the main parameters of its fans 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.150
 performance 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.400
 i.e. the air volume passed 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.410
 fan per unit of time between 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.930
 fan performance and level 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.120
 noise there is a direct relationship than 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.540
 higher performance the higher the level 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.540
 noise
