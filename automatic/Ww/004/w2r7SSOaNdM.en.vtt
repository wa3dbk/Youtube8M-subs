putting that grip on that helps keep

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
putting that grip on that helps keep
that<00:01:08.159> nice<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> low<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> see

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that nice and low as you're going to see

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
that nice and low as you're going to see
on<00:01:09.869> screen<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.040> long<00:01:11.220> range

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
on screen it's pretty good at long range

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
on screen it's pretty good at long range
but<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:11.970> its<00:01:12.090> best<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.960> its

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
but it's at its best when it's at its

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
but it's at its best when it's at its
like<00:01:13.409> mid<00:01:13.740> range<00:01:14.010> level<00:01:14.460> dies<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.240> at

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
like mid range level dies when it's at

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
like mid range level dies when it's at
its<00:01:15.360> best<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.810> its<00:01:15.960> main<00:01:16.229> advantage<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> would

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
its best but its main advantage I would

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
its best but its main advantage I would
say<00:01:17.220> overall<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.790> weapons<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> class

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
say overall the weapons in this class

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.530 
say overall the weapons in this class
specifically<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> has<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.909> massive

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
specifically is that it has got massive

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.960 
specifically is that it has got massive
massive<00:01:21.720> diversity<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.159> very<00:01:23.310> flexible

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
massive diversity is very very flexible

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
massive diversity is very very flexible
and<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.479> makes<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> perfect<00:01:24.900> weapon<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and it makes it the perfect weapon for

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
and it makes it the perfect weapon for
call<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> duty<00:01:26.130> ghosts<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.090> maps<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
call of duty ghosts because the maps in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
call of duty ghosts because the maps in
ecology<00:01:27.990> ghosts<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:28.680> buried<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.579> times

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
ecology ghosts are very buried at times

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
ecology ghosts are very buried at times
it<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.240> small<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.200> lot<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it can be very small but a lot of the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
it can be very small but a lot of the
time<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.369> may<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.610> noticed<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.119> are

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
time you may have noticed they are

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
time you may have noticed they are
pretty<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> lot

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
pretty big you know there are a lot

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.170 
pretty big you know there are a lot
bigger<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.159> some<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> previous<00:01:35.850> maps

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bigger than some of the previous maps

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
bigger than some of the previous maps
that<00:01:36.299> we've<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.540> previous<00:01:36.780> games<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that we've had in previous games this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
that we've had in previous games this
gun<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.250> absolutely<00:01:38.850> perfect<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> because

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
gun is absolutely perfect for it because

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
gun is absolutely perfect for it because
it<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.930> cover<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.159> different

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it can cover a lot of the different

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.670 
it can cover a lot of the different
areas<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.000> equally<00:01:42.540> good<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:42.930> medium<00:01:43.290> ranges

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
areas is equally good as medium ranges

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
areas is equally good as medium ranges
is<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> long<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.490> short<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.780> win<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is that long and short it will win you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
is that long and short it will win you
those<00:01:46.200> head-on<00:01:46.590> 1v1<00:01:47.009> battles<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> come

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
those head-on 1v1 battles that you come

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
those head-on 1v1 battles that you come
into<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> close<00:01:48.689> quarter<00:01:49.110> combat<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
into in the close quarter combat but it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
into in the close quarter combat but it
will<00:01:50.280> also<00:01:50.490> allow<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.060> pick<00:01:51.240> out<00:01:51.360> targets

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
will also allow you to pick out targets

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
will also allow you to pick out targets
at<00:01:52.079> long<00:01:52.409> ranges<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
at long ranges as well that is what I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.280 
at long ranges as well that is what I
love<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.329> weapon<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> only<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
love about this weapon the only things I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.959 
love about this weapon the only things I
don't<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.009> weapon<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
don't like about this weapon are the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
don't like about this weapon are the
slightly<00:01:57.390> clumsy<00:01:57.719> cluttered<00:01:58.409> iron<00:01:58.619> sights<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
slightly clumsy cluttered iron sights I

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.289 
slightly clumsy cluttered iron sights I
feel<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.340> there's<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> little<00:01:59.729> bit<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.090> much

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
feel like there's a little bit too much

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.600 
feel like there's a little bit too much
going<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.659> down<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.140> around<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.250> bottom

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
going on down there around the bottom

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
going on down there around the bottom
and<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> edges<00:02:03.210> especially<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:04.320> blocking<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and the edges especially just blocking a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
and the edges especially just blocking a
little<00:02:04.860> bit<00:02:04.950> too<00:02:05.130> much<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> get

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
little bit too much but you can just get

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.639 
little bit too much but you can just get
around<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.509> putting<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> red<00:02:07.020> dot<00:02:07.229> sight<00:02:07.469> on

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
around that putting a red dot sight on

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.369 
around that putting a red dot sight on
and<00:02:07.829> also<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.270> long<00:02:09.479> range<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.050> you're

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and also a really long range if you're

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.780 
and also a really long range if you're
shooting<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.520> more

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
shooting you will get a little bit more

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.700 
shooting you will get a little bit more
recoil<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.480> bargained<00:02:12.959> for<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.379> do

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
recoil than you bargained for so do

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
recoil than you bargained for so do
use<00:02:14.010> kind<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.670> burst<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
use kind of like just burst it like you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
use kind of like just burst it like you
will<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> three<00:02:16.410> round<00:02:16.530> burst<00:02:16.770> weapon

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
will do with a three round burst weapon

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.970 
will do with a three round burst weapon
just<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.300> you'll<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.230> fine<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:19.890> yeah

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
just do that and you'll be fine but yeah

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
just do that and you'll be fine but yeah
that's<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> super<00:02:21.330> long<00:02:21.480> range

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that's not just for the super long range

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.970 
that's not just for the super long range
things<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> probably<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> anyway

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
things you probably do that anyway

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.040 
things you probably do that anyway
without<00:02:23.100> even<00:02:23.400> knowing<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.030> yeah<00:02:24.720> let's<00:02:24.900> move

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
without even knowing so yeah let's move

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.480 
without even knowing so yeah let's move
on<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> secondary<00:02:25.770> weapon<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.280> which

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
on to the secondary weapon now which

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.520 
on to the secondary weapon now which
I've<00:02:26.730> chosen<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.960> pretty<00:02:28.140> much<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> only

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I've chosen it's pretty much the only

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.780 
I've chosen it's pretty much the only
one<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> choose<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
one that you can choose because the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.150 
one that you can choose because the
other<00:02:29.880> lot<00:02:30.240> aren't<00:02:30.450> too<00:02:30.930> great<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.920> I've

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
other lot aren't too great so I've

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430 
other lot aren't too great so I've
chosen<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.580> PDW<00:02:33.240> pistol<00:02:33.750> which<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> only

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
chosen the PDW pistol which is the only

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.530 
chosen the PDW pistol which is the only
three<00:02:34.860> round<00:02:35.040> burst<00:02:35.280> pistol<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.180> only<00:02:36.390> one

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
three round burst pistol the only one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.590 
three round burst pistol the only one
that<00:02:36.780> isn't<00:02:37.050> single<00:02:37.560> fire<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.940> yeah<00:02:39.300> it's

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
that isn't single fire so yeah it's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.090 
that isn't single fire so yeah it's
three<00:02:39.990> bursts<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.530> better<00:02:40.710> than<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> rest

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
three bursts it's better than the rest

the start are going to have those
satcoms<00:04:04.770> up<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:05.370> they're<00:04:05.520> just<00:04:05.670> default

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060

start of the game to get this perk on

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.370 
start of the game to get this perk on
you'll<00:04:11.850> get<00:04:12.000> hidden<00:04:12.210> from<00:04:12.420> those<00:04:12.630> sonar<00:04:13.110> pings

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
you'll get hidden from those sonar pings

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.890 
you'll get hidden from those sonar pings
and<00:04:13.530> those<00:04:14.160> satcoms<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.970> yeah<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.810> gonna

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
the next book that I've picked is called

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.440 
the next book that I've picked is called
amplify<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.890> basically<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.880> allows<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.330> to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
amplify and basically it allows you to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.630 
amplify and basically it allows you to
give<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.960> enemy<00:04:22.109> footsteps<00:04:22.440> really<00:04:23.370> really

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
give the enemy footsteps really really

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.280 
give the enemy footsteps really really
loud<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.390> especially<00:04:24.600> useful<00:04:24.930> if

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
loud so this is especially useful if

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.110 
loud so this is especially useful if
you're<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.440> headset<00:04:25.830> user<00:04:26.040> if<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.700> are<00:04:26.850> you've

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
activate a sonar ping that goes out like

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.369 
activate a sonar ping that goes out like

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
to activate a mini UAV essentially and

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.529 
to activate a mini UAV essentially and
you're<00:05:33.669> going<00:05:33.789> to<00:05:33.849> be<00:05:33.909> able<00:05:33.939> to<00:05:34.120> see<00:05:34.240> them<00:05:34.389> on

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
you're going to be able to see them on

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.570 
you're going to be able to see them on
your<00:05:34.689> mini-map<00:05:34.900> as<00:05:35.199> a<00:05:35.229> red<00:05:35.439> dot<00:05:35.710> so<00:05:36.009> that<00:05:36.490> is

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
your mini-map as a red dot so that is

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.399 
your mini-map as a red dot so that is
also<00:05:36.789> useful<00:05:37.120> not<00:05:37.569> a<00:05:37.599> lot<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.779> people<00:05:37.870> actually

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
also useful not a lot of people actually

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.260 
also useful not a lot of people actually
use<00:05:38.439> that<00:05:38.860> so<00:05:39.069> it's<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.430> really<00:05:39.669> useful<00:05:39.849> perk

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
use that so it's a really useful perk

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.329 
use that so it's a really useful perk
all<00:05:41.020> these<00:05:41.199> perks<00:05:41.469> I<00:05:41.589> think<00:05:41.800> are<00:05:41.919> really<00:05:42.099> good

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:42.339 
all these perks I think are really good

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:43.529
