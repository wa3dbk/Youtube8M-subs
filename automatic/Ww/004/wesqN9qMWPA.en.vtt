can practice for the trick on the real

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
can practice for the trick on the real
flight<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.829> necessary<00:01:02.609> for

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
flight so how much time is necessary for

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
flight so how much time is necessary for
these<00:01:02.910> tricks<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.600> will<00:01:03.719> decide<00:01:03.989> about<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.409> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
these tricks we will decide about it so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 
these tricks we will decide about it so
let's<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> challenge<00:01:05.519> flight<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
let's do this challenge flight here is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890 
let's do this challenge flight here is

take off and show me an inverted power

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:46.630 
take off and show me an inverted power
for<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.180> least<00:01:27.390> 30<00:01:27.720> seconds

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
alright your inverted hover can end up

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.560 
alright your inverted hover can end up
close<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.290> ground<00:01:57.500> as<00:01:57.860> well

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570

watch it watch it and get up go out of
inverted<00:02:13.630> hover<00:02:14.070> rotate<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.500> think

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
inverted hover rotate right I think

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.880 
inverted hover rotate right I think
that's<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.940> prick<00:02:19.240> you're<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.630> do
