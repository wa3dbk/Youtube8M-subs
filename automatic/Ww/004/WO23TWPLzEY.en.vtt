I'm<00:02:09.210> actually<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.230> 50

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
I'm actually going to put the 50

I'm actually going to put the 50
millimeter<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.340> using<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:13.010> 1.8<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.340> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
millimeter I'm using a 1.8 it's going to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.720 
millimeter I'm using a 1.8 it's going to
go<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.820> these<00:02:15.060> cases<00:02:15.390> along<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.320> some

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
go in one of these cases along with some

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.750 
go in one of these cases along with some
remote<00:02:17.730> flash<00:02:18.150> triggers<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.470> remote<00:02:20.400> shutter

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
remote flash triggers a remote shutter

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.380 
remote flash triggers a remote shutter
or<00:02:21.060> filters<00:02:22.040> other<00:02:23.040> things<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:24.030> go<00:02:24.150> right

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
or filters other things can go right

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.470 
or filters other things can go right
there<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.840> well<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> also

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
there really well now so you can also

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
there really well now so you can also
this<00:02:27.900> zips<00:02:28.260> down<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.860> cover<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> keep

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
this zips down to cover up that keep

this zips down to cover up that keep
everything<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.390> place<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:31.140> these<00:02:31.350> pull<00:02:31.710> right

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
everything in place now these pull right

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.930 
everything in place now these pull right
out<00:02:32.090> has<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.480> belt<00:02:33.660> front<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.020> anything

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
out has a little belt front of anything

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.620 
out has a little belt front of anything
you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.090> pull<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.330> right<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.570> then<00:02:39.570> you

you can pull that right out and then you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.690 
you can pull that right out and then you
have<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.110> bottom<00:02:40.410> section<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.220> really<00:02:41.550> has

there<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.040> quick<00:03:23.850> overview<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.600> case<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
there so quick overview the case it's a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
there so quick overview the case it's a
great<00:03:26.610> fill<00:03:26.940> case<00:03:27.270> like<00:03:27.570> any<00:03:27.750> Pelican<00:03:28.290> case

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
great fill case like any Pelican case

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.699 
great fill case like any Pelican case
strong<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.280> anything<00:03:29.959> it's<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.140> good<00:03:31.290> amount<00:03:31.500> of

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
strong as anything it's a good amount of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.250 
strong as anything it's a good amount of
stuff<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> little

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
stuff and I have a little

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.890 
stuff and I have a little
to<00:03:33.439> grow<00:03:33.680> here<00:03:34.010> these<00:03:34.280> isn't<00:03:35.239> really<00:03:35.599> fit

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
to grow here these isn't really fit

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.440 
to grow here these isn't really fit
perfectly<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.099> can<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.519> they<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.030> could

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
perfectly as you can see they I could

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.179 
perfectly as you can see they I could
take<00:03:38.629> off<00:03:38.840> these<00:03:39.079> lens<00:03:39.379> hoods<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.920> probably

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
take off these lens hoods and probably

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.740 
take off these lens hoods and probably
put<00:03:40.370> them<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.700> bottom<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.239> stack<00:03:41.569> them

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
put them in the bottom and stack them

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.660 
put them in the bottom and stack them
together<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.409> have<00:03:42.590> some<00:03:42.829> more<00:03:43.010> room<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.430> top

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
together and have some more room up top

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.059 
together and have some more room up top
then<00:03:43.970> right<00:03:44.150> now<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.360> don't<00:03:44.599> need<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.230> there

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
then right now I don't need it so there

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.860 
then right now I don't need it so there
you<00:03:46.220> go<00:03:46.370> with<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> quick<00:03:46.849> overview<00:03:47.239> let's<00:03:47.720> see
