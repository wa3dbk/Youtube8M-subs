terribly<00:04:18.660> much<00:04:18.750> unless<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.530> really<00:04:19.739> want<00:04:19.859> to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
terribly much unless you really want to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.550 
terribly much unless you really want to
get<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.400> Santa<00:04:20.849> robot<00:04:21.209> otherwise<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.410> could

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
get the Santa robot otherwise you could

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.200 
get the Santa robot otherwise you could
probably<00:04:22.740> pass<00:04:23.160> on<00:04:23.370> him<00:04:23.490> he<00:04:23.610> appears<00:04:23.970> more

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
probably pass on him he appears more

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.409 
probably pass on him he appears more
obviously<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> show<00:04:25.580> then<00:04:26.580> king<00:04:27.000> bender

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
obviously in the show then king bender

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.529 
obviously in the show then king bender
did<00:04:27.599> but<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.470> overall<00:04:28.919> still<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.849> know<00:04:29.970> yeah

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
did but it's overall still you know yeah

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.710 
did but it's overall still you know yeah
I'm<00:04:31.470> kind<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.770> me<00:04:32.010> about<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.910> figure<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.450> I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
I'm kind of me about this figure but I

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990 
I'm kind of me about this figure but I
do<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:34.800> Calculon<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.400> think<00:04:35.580> he's<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.729> fun

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
do like Calculon I think he's a fun

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.940 
do like Calculon I think he's a fun
character<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.870> show<00:04:36.900> but<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.800> almost

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
character on the show but it's almost

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.580 
character on the show but it's almost
like<00:04:38.099> they're<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.090> toy<00:04:39.570> company<00:04:40.110> -

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
like they're you know the toy company -

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.800 
like they're you know the toy company -
I<00:04:40.620> know<00:04:40.800> me<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.130> kind<00:04:41.639> of<00:04:41.729> reaching<00:04:42.450> for

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
I know me is kind of reaching for

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.240 
I know me is kind of reaching for
figures<00:04:43.110> right<00:04:43.349> now<00:04:43.470> they<00:04:43.590> got<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.770> lot<00:04:44.070> that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
figures right now they got a lot that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.959 
figures right now they got a lot that
they<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.520> use<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.539> think<00:04:45.570> that

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
they can use and I think that

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.699 
they can use and I think that
just<00:04:46.239> trying<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.509> burn<00:04:46.719> through<00:04:46.959> him<00:04:47.259> for<00:04:47.649> the

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:47.709 
just trying to burn through him for the

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.619 
just trying to burn through him for the
most<00:04:47.889> part<00:04:48.129> but<00:04:48.309> overall<00:04:48.729> there's<00:04:49.029> Calculon

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
most part but overall there's Calculon

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
most part but overall there's Calculon
until<00:04:50.199> next<00:04:50.319> time<00:04:50.589> this<00:04:50.769> is<00:04:50.829> Optimus
