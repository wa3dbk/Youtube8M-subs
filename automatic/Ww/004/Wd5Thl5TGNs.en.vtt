00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 I remember hearing from you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.770
 I was a girl and of course I remember 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 that oats we eat that we 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
 It also helps to eliminate cholesterol and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 well let's wind it out 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 truth the oatmeal notice that it is going to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.960
 serve to make two masks one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.520
 for dry skin and one for oily skin 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 we have usually identified it for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 control the fat but if your skin on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 this moment is very dry let's do 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.440
 a special preparation that olguita is going 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 to be the favor today's open 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.149
 the instructions with a lot we're going to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.159
 use oatmeal look very good oatmeal 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.940
 honey is more then empty the oats where 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.810
 is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 now I do honey oatmeal and look carefully 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 and a little milk what we are 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 doing is obviously giving you these 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.380
 nutrients to our skin those 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 moisturizers with when mixing our oats 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.050
 and a little bit of milk like that is milk 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.110
 it must be at room temperature ok and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.300
 this yes and in this case you the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.790
 they want to have a little cold it's fine 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.910
 but not icy ok it's very important to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.680
 we make these steps 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
 exactly how we tell them the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.040
 temperature so you have to see is very 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.440
 important smells delicious and we eat it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.350
 so that's in the case obviously of 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.820
 a dry skin that we are hydrating 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 we are putting honey is to put a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.830
 little milk and remember what 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.420
 we have to do is clean up our 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.640
 remember that there we are going to open the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.590
 forum then let's put our 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.350
 mask removed from the eyes area 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.970
 let's leave it 15 to 20 minutes and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 look very good when we go to 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.950
 check that we are going to be able to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.880
 remove with warm or lukewarm water and let's 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 close the forum 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.060
 our roses remember that it is a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 courageous is wonderful that we are going to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 help to close the forum by also we 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.930
 is going to give remaining then this is in 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.100
 the case of dry skin and that I love 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.960
 because I always had the truth 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.360
 heard that the oatmeal mask was 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.760
 for the belly all and names of the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.830
 restored too much like this then 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.200
 I tell you to eat action and mom because my 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.510
 Mom dares this mask in the first 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.400
 He heats water and there he puts a washcloth 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.680
 legrand and I come to open the for today 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.990
 they open the skin very clear grace and then 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.670
 it is set but it is another other modality without 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.440
 wait besides remember that the girls 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.940
 today that have little time I say that 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.520
 father that everyone could do the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.410
 weakness to a hot truth but if 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.030
 you do not have the time really 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.890
 I agree that if you use your cream 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.060
 cleaner that will open the forum and 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.860
 we will be able to introduce it 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.040
 and we are going to make one more next 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.250
 is our oatmeal also with yogurt 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.250
 natural 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.080
 pay attention that it will help us 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.880
 perfectly the yogurt to pick up the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.950
 combination with oats precisely to 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.170
 counteract that fat that makes us 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.990
 Shine the skin your block then 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.970
 we will also open the forum and with 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.580
 our cleaning cream 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.330
 let's apply our mask and 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.680
 let's leave it there for 15 minutes 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.810
 notice very well you are going to start 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.740

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.110
 your skin stretches ok and it is normal not to 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.200
 worry nothing happens are products 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.750
 totally natural eye what's important 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.320
 to be effective your mask is 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.090
 that you apply with an open bull ok 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.980
 there are people who after bathing that 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.330
 leave in the afternoon you know what suppose 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.130
 is open then there you can 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.770
 apply and then remove them without 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.510
 problem but that's the point you have 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.730

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.530

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.789
