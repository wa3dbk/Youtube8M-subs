00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 It disappears this time 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.259
 It's been a long time and it's a rare Gacha 10 series Gasse 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.259
 And 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 Come big event Do not come is 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.560
 Once limited new cm broadcasting commemorative star 5 finalized 10 trains 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.960
 I will turn around 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.110

 Fukuda Uge: It has changed 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.290
 If it is a star by two people or one time limitation, one body must be fine and you want all souls to be decided over 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.110
 We will hold 10 consecutive gacha campaign 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.110
 Highest accuracy rate past what marked the star 6 new way 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 I don't bother this and don't sleep this good guy 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.890
 It is three times almost always three times 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.890
 It is 2.5 times even if we return to useless almost well 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.700
 so 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.840
 Well large art well hp 1.2 times attack power 2.5 times character 6 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.960
 There are a lot of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:14.490
 Oh, the pastor's pastor appears to be a bar and these guys all have an equal day 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.210
 It is scary at equal magnification, and probability is less than 1/4 probability 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 I can not count properly 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.729
 By the way, if you go to the first place each well 20 par lunch 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.729
 20 Parker 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.799
 20 par is a little scary to be a one shot match 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 here we go 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 Let's draw that 6 stars of stars come out 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.740
 That a strong character comes out 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.200
 I because about a 75 If you think trying to pick off Datte like this do 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.200
 It 's about the level of entering a ramper 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 Hmm 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.610

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.040
 Clothing was a Godzilla family 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
 Can you be a top secret at the very end of the spring? 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.660
 Thank you 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.780
 so 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.000
 Beauty system

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 It's skinny . 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.510
 When 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.480
 It is there 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 If it is taken now, the art always goes out well 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.550
 Because you are good 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.550
 Another virtual singer who raised stock prices several times in the meantime 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.730

 I wonder if you are different 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.380
 Yes light 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.750
 Buy money 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.750
 It is a tree with a floor drawn by more 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.070
 Barn 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.079
 I wonder does not love is not what star log home 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 It does not come out 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.870
 I 'll do my best and bring up this guy 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.950
 It was really arc 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.950
 Gone 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.030

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.080
 This guy is a cat 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.970
 Yeah or Ne 's guy bullets guy 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.970
 Only the moment from the star 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.580
 I did it 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.319
 Entered Fukuzawa has become to one 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.720
 Poop 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.870
 Ah 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:09.060
 Let's enter one's right 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.060
 Though it is a good talk about 8 and 10 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.490
 We do not charge for the moment so far, but it is not another recklessness , so timing sample 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.460
 There is also a case to be over 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.139
 Just that 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.930
 In order to get a strong character, you can not charge the battery like this 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:30.030
 You're basically 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.850
 Well I want to character development Toka want to somewhere orbiting missing several sheets sparsely populated that there is no Fukuda at that time 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.350
 But it also might do little or adjective to when there is no 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:41.020
 In order to turn Rare Gacha 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.400
 It's probably going to be over and over to get rid of the rare gachas in a row and for sure 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.770
 I do not think 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.210
 Prima facie supplement called 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.840
 In the place that had been 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.650
 a For now 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.509
 It was disastrous 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.509
 I would like to accumulate tips again 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.990
 Yes 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.780
 Getta Getaway 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.880
