00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.640 

okay<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.920> is<00:00:08.130> now<00:00:08.400> dry

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.620 

fairly<00:00:13.400> simple<00:00:13.700> way<00:00:13.850> of<00:00:14.000> telling<00:00:14.330> that<00:00:14.360> it's

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
fairly simple way of telling that it's

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.520 
fairly simple way of telling that it's
dry<00:00:14.900> is<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.440> put<00:00:15.650> it<00:00:15.770> on<00:00:16.010> your<00:00:16.280> wrist<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:17.530> if

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
dry is to put it on your wrist and if

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.480 
dry is to put it on your wrist and if
it's<00:00:18.770> cool

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
it's cool

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.790 
it's cool
then<00:00:20.270> there's<00:00:20.660> likely<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.230> be<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.410> little<00:00:21.710> bit

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
then there's likely to be a little bit

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.370 
then there's likely to be a little bit
of<00:00:21.920> moisture<00:00:22.070> still<00:00:22.610> in<00:00:22.730> there<00:00:23.140> if<00:00:24.140> it's

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
of moisture still in there if it's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.320 
of moisture still in there if it's
obviously<00:00:25.190> if<00:00:25.279> you've<00:00:25.400> had<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.580> on<00:00:25.790> a<00:00:25.820> radiator

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
obviously if you've had it on a radiator

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.940 
obviously if you've had it on a radiator
or<00:00:26.480> something<00:00:26.810> then<00:00:26.960> let<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:27.200> cool<00:00:27.350> down<00:00:27.590> first

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
or something then let it cool down first

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.460 
or something then let it cool down first
we'll<00:00:28.220> reach<00:00:28.369> room<00:00:28.640> temperature<00:00:28.900> but<00:00:29.900> that's

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
we'll reach room temperature but that's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.350 
we'll reach room temperature but that's
quite<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.830> good<00:00:31.070> way<00:00:31.250> of<00:00:31.490> telling<00:00:32.060> that<00:00:32.090> it's

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
quite a good way of telling that it's

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.940 
quite a good way of telling that it's
dry<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.810> important<00:00:33.290> thing<00:00:33.470> is<00:00:33.650> that<00:00:33.680> it

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
dry and the important thing is that it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.670 
dry and the important thing is that it
must<00:00:34.670> not<00:00:34.820> have<00:00:35.090> any<00:00:35.300> moisture<00:00:35.540> in<00:00:35.990> it<00:00:36.200> when

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
must not have any moisture in it when

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.090 
must not have any moisture in it when
you<00:00:36.829> fire<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.570> because<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.930> moisture<00:00:39.920> can

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
you fire it because the moisture can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.740 
you fire it because the moisture can
cause<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:41.030> clay<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:41.530> bubble<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.090> distort<00:00:44.090> so

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
cause the clay to bubble and distort so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.410 
cause the clay to bubble and distort so
we<00:00:45.080> need<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.440> ensure<00:00:46.070> that<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:46.370> dry<00:00:46.670> before

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
we need to ensure that it's dry before

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.840 
we need to ensure that it's dry before
we<00:00:47.840> fire<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:48.380> now<00:00:48.650> that<00:00:49.310> it's<00:00:49.430> dry<00:00:49.580> we<00:00:49.820> can

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
we fire it now that it's dry we can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.200 
we fire it now that it's dry we can
refine<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.630> so<00:00:50.840> we<00:00:51.110> can<00:00:51.260> use<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:52.460> emery<00:00:53.180> paper

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
refine it so we can use the emery paper

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.300 
refine it so we can use the emery paper
which<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:53.930> spoke<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.740> before<00:00:54.860> and

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
which I spoke to you about it before and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.940 
which I spoke to you about it before and
you<00:00:55.400> can<00:00:56.180> cut<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:56.510> up<00:00:56.720> obviously<00:00:56.900> but<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
you can cut this up obviously but you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.080 
you can cut this up obviously but you
can<00:00:58.100> just<00:00:58.310> refine<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.030> edges<00:00:59.180> with<00:00:59.600> it<00:01:01.090> smooth

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
can just refine the edges with it smooth

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.640 
can just refine the edges with it smooth
any<00:01:02.510> any<00:01:02.840> little<00:01:03.250> rough<00:01:04.250> bits<00:01:04.519> down<00:01:05.650> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
any any little rough bits down and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.020 
any any little rough bits down and
another<00:01:06.860> way<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.159> can<00:01:07.400> do<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:07.850> have

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
another way you can do it is if you have

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.240 
another way you can do it is if you have
a<00:01:08.060> craft<00:01:08.390> knife<00:01:08.780> obviously<00:01:09.500> being<00:01:10.009> very

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
a craft knife obviously being very

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.609 
a craft knife obviously being very
careful<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:11.540> actually<00:01:11.689> just<00:01:12.110> scrape

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
careful you can actually just scrape

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.219 
careful you can actually just scrape
little<00:01:13.040> bits<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.939> clay<00:01:14.390> off<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:17.390> tidy<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
little bits of the clay off to tidy the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.810 
little bits of the clay off to tidy the
edges<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.770> way

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
edges that way

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.820 
edges that way
make<00:01:20.480> sure<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.900> save<00:01:21.230> all<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.680> these

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
make sure that you save all of these

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.790 
make sure that you save all of these
pieces<00:01:22.130> because<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:22.670> can<00:01:23.030> reconstitute<00:01:23.960> that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
pieces because we can reconstitute that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.740 
pieces because we can reconstitute that
silver<00:01:25.160> clay<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:25.730> to<00:01:25.850> meet<00:01:26.030> them<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.330> hole<00:01:26.540> up

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
silver clay so to meet them the hole up

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.900 
silver clay so to meet them the hole up
up<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.290> can<00:01:27.470> use<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.830> knife<00:01:28.040> quite<00:01:28.430> easily<00:01:28.640> as

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
up you can use the knife quite easily as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.590 
up you can use the knife quite easily as
well<00:01:29.090> by<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.300> scraping<00:01:29.960> gently<00:01:30.500> around<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
well by just scraping gently around the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.020 
well by just scraping gently around the
the<00:01:32.630> inner<00:01:33.380> part<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> hole<00:01:34.160> you<00:01:34.430> wanted<00:01:34.820> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the inner part of the hole you wanted to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.760 
the inner part of the hole you wanted to
you<00:01:35.210> could<00:01:35.330> also<00:01:35.830> rub<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.010> gently<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:38.330> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
you could also rub it gently on the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.850 
you could also rub it gently on the
emery<00:01:39.770> paper<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> back<00:01:40.790> flat<00:01:41.860> so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
emery paper to get the back flat so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440 
emery paper to get the back flat so
let's<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:43.220> flatten<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.910> little<00:01:44.150> bit

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
let's just flatten the back a little bit

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.890 
let's just flatten the back a little bit
there

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
there

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.860 
there
this<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:46.040> fragile<00:01:46.400> still<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.660> little

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
this is fragile still so it's a little

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.870 
this is fragile still so it's a little
bit<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> biscuit<00:01:48.800> if<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.520> could<00:01:49.640> imagine

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
bit like a biscuit if you could imagine

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.240 
bit like a biscuit if you could imagine
if<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.270> snap<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.900> now<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.770> would<00:01:51.950> be<00:01:52.070> like

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
if I snap that now it would be like

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.010 
if I snap that now it would be like
snapping<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.759> biscuit<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.300> half<00:01:53.509> because<00:01:53.720> it's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
snapping a biscuit in half because it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.850 
snapping a biscuit in half because it's
not<00:01:54.229> yet<00:01:54.470> fired<00:01:54.830> it's<00:01:55.070> simply<00:01:55.460> dried<00:01:56.380> okay<00:01:57.380> so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
not yet fired it's simply dried okay so

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.800 
not yet fired it's simply dried okay so
now<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.310> we've<00:01:58.580> refined<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.690> we're

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
now that we've refined it and we're

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.900 
now that we've refined it and we're
quite<00:01:59.930> happy<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.220> next<00:02:01.430> thing<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.759> do

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
quite happy with it the next thing to do

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.350 
quite happy with it the next thing to do
is<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.570> fire<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.700> when<00:02:04.850> you're<00:02:04.970> ready<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
is to fire it so when you're ready to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.790 
is to fire it so when you're ready to
fire<00:02:05.950> prepare<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.280> timer<00:02:08.320> set<00:02:09.320> for<00:02:09.350> five

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
see where the hottest parts will be when

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.699 
see where the hottest parts will be when
the<00:02:36.890> burner<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.340> lit<00:02:37.610> then<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.720> safety's<00:02:39.170> sake

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the burner is lit then for safety's sake

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.610 
the burner is lit then for safety's sake
turn<00:02:40.190> off<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.670> burner<00:02:41.049> but<00:02:42.049> keep<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.410> mind

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
turn off the burner but keep in mind

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
turn off the burner but keep in mind
where<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> red<00:02:43.160> parts<00:02:43.580> are<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.970> can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
where the red parts are and then you can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.699 
where the red parts are and then you can
place<00:02:47.360> your<00:02:47.560> dried<00:02:48.560> silver<00:02:49.220> clay<00:02:49.519> onto<00:02:50.680> one<00:02:51.680> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
place your dried silver clay onto one of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:03:00.480 
place your dried silver clay onto one of
the<00:02:51.890> hottest<00:02:52.070> parts<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.820> relight<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.690> gas

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.550 

now<00:03:01.030> you'll<00:03:01.210> see<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:01.480> beginning<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.900> heat<00:03:02.530> up

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
now you'll see it's beginning to heat up

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620 
now you'll see it's beginning to heat up
the<00:03:02.890> mesh<00:03:03.100> again<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.210> means<00:03:04.450> that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the mesh again and so that means that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.090 
the mesh again and so that means that
the<00:03:04.780> heat<00:03:04.900> will<00:03:05.050> transfer<00:03:05.230> up<00:03:05.620> into<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
the heat will transfer up into the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.220 
the heat will transfer up into the
silver<00:03:06.520> clay<00:03:06.730> as<00:03:06.850> well<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.600> sometimes<00:03:08.020> get<00:03:08.200> a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
silver clay as well you sometimes get a

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.680 
silver clay as well you sometimes get a
little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.710> smoke<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.400> now<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:10.360> see

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
little bit of smoke and now you can see

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.350 
little bit of smoke and now you can see
hopefully<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.770> flame<00:03:12.160> which<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.030> actually

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
hopefully the flame which is actually

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.430 
hopefully the flame which is actually
the<00:03:13.480> binder<00:03:14.080> burning<00:03:14.740> off<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:16.090> silver<00:03:17.050> clay

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
the binder burning off the silver clay

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.100 
the binder burning off the silver clay
and<00:03:17.770> it's<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.490> this<00:03:18.700> moment<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:19.750> turns

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
and it's at this moment that this turns

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.440 
and it's at this moment that this turns
into<00:03:20.440> silver<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:21.820> when<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.270> also

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
into silver and that's when you also

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.650 
into silver and that's when you also
press<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.820> timer<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.840> five<00:03:26.380> minutes

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
press the timer for five minutes

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.540 
press the timer for five minutes
this<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:28.930> has<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.320> be<00:03:29.440> heating<00:03:30.040> for<00:03:30.280> five

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
this now has to be heating for five

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.820 
this now has to be heating for five
minutes<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.630> all<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.050> particles<00:03:32.560> of

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
minutes so that all of the particles of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.860 
minutes so that all of the particles of
silver<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.670> fused<00:03:34.180> together<00:03:34.390> properly

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
silver and fused together properly

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.290 
silver and fused together properly
that's<00:03:35.530> why<00:03:35.830> there's<00:03:36.070> about<00:03:36.340> 10%<00:03:36.700> shrinkage

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
that's why there's about 10% shrinkage

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.990 
that's why there's about 10% shrinkage
when<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.170> fire<00:03:38.470> silver<00:03:38.920> clay<00:03:39.160> because<00:03:39.850> the

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
when you fire silver clay because the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.410 
when you fire silver clay because the
binder<00:03:40.510> burns<00:03:40.840> away<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:42.400> particles<00:03:43.120> fuse

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
binder burns away and the particles fuse

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.070 
binder burns away and the particles fuse
together<00:03:45.030> okay<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.360> now<00:03:46.540> had<00:03:46.840> five

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
together okay so that's now had five

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.830 
together okay so that's now had five
minutes<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.860> switch<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> timer<00:03:48.550> off<00:03:48.810> turn<00:03:49.810> off

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
minutes so switch the timer off turn off

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.820 
minutes so switch the timer off turn off
the<00:03:50.200> gas

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
the gas

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.950 
the gas
most<00:03:51.340> important<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:53.470> tip<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.960> silver

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
most important and just tip the silver

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.350 
most important and just tip the silver
clay<00:03:56.200> pendant<00:03:56.680> into<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> water<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.150> does

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
clay pendant into the water and it does

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.300 
clay pendant into the water and it does
fizzle<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:02.110> bit<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.530> don't<00:04:02.890> worry<00:04:03.070> about

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
fizzle a little bit so don't worry about

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.280 
fizzle a little bit so don't worry about
the<00:04:03.430> sound<00:04:03.640> that's<00:04:03.850> just<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.330> cooling<00:04:04.600> off<00:04:04.930> as

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the sound that's just it cooling off as

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.700 
the sound that's just it cooling off as
it<00:04:05.530> hits<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.070> cold<00:04:06.370> water
