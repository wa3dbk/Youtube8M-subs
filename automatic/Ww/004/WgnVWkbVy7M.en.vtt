completely<00:01:34.590> necessary<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.520> no<00:01:36.270> isolations

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
completely necessary but no isolations

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
completely necessary but no isolations
it's<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.270> comfortable<00:01:39.270> playing

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
going to let it look up kind of closer

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.000 
going to let it look up kind of closer
to<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.099> handle<00:02:25.579> you're<00:02:26.329> right<00:02:26.450> about<00:02:26.569> there

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
so if you'll notice kind of isolate

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.440 
so if you'll notice kind of isolate
there<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:31.099> they<00:02:31.280> kind<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.519> hook<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:33.310> ok<00:02:34.450> next

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
there then they kind of hook up ok next

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.250 
there then they kind of hook up ok next
step<00:02:36.849> when<00:02:37.849> they<00:02:38.000> link<00:02:38.269> up<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.780> soon<00:02:38.989> as<00:02:39.140> there

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
step when they link up as soon as there

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.830 
step when they link up as soon as there
we<00:02:39.439> go<00:02:40.000> kind<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.060> put<00:02:41.239> your<00:02:41.390> hands<00:02:41.689> out<00:02:41.780> in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
we go kind of put your hands out in

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.539 
we go kind of put your hands out in
front<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.489> about<00:02:43.810> right<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:45.549> right

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
front of you about right there right

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.250 
front of you about right there right
there<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.970> they<00:02:47.090> have<00:02:47.209> room<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.629> kind<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.989> spin

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
there so they have room to kind of spin

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.330 
there so they have room to kind of spin
and<00:02:50.470> after<00:02:51.470> they<00:02:51.590> link<00:02:51.859> up<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.220> they're<00:02:52.310> out

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and after they link up and they're out

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.199 
and after they link up and they're out
in<00:02:52.430> front<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.849> just<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:54.139> quick<00:02:54.470> jerk<00:02:54.530> I

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
in front of you just do one quick jerk I

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.460 
in front of you just do one quick jerk I
noticed<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.420> lot<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.720> people<00:02:57.139> when<00:02:57.319> they<00:02:57.409> do

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
noticed a lot of people when they do

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.879 
noticed a lot of people when they do
orbitals<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:59.480> lot<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> people<00:03:00.260> are<00:03:00.379> converting

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
orbitals a lot of people are converting

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.479 
orbitals a lot of people are converting
from<00:03:01.040> lowest<00:03:01.909> ring<00:03:02.060> deploy<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:03.489> other

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
from lowest ring deploy the other

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.119 
from lowest ring deploy the other
glaciers<00:03:04.730> will<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:05.389> pull<00:03:06.139> all<00:03:06.409> the<00:03:06.769> layout

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
glaciers will just pull all the layout

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.270 
glaciers will just pull all the layout
and<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.670> know<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:09.260> works<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:09.709> glowsticks<00:03:10.159> i

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
and you know it works for glowsticks i

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.610 
and you know it works for glowsticks i
guess<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:10.760> with<00:03:11.030> poi<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:12.079> can't<00:03:12.319> just<00:03:12.440> keep

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
guess but with poi you can't just keep

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.990 
guess but with poi you can't just keep
on<00:03:12.829> pulling<00:03:13.480> because<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.519> doesn't<00:03:16.879> work

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
on pulling because it just doesn't work

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.970 
on pulling because it just doesn't work
that<00:03:17.060> way<00:03:17.419> you<00:03:17.629> have<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.230> one<00:03:18.590> quick

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
that way you have to do just one quick

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.229 
that way you have to do just one quick
jerk<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.989> will<00:03:21.379> send<00:03:21.970> your<00:03:22.970> poi

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
jerk and then that will send your poi

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.210 
jerk and then that will send your poi
into<00:03:23.750> an<00:03:23.900> orbital<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:26.680> I'll<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:27.949> for<00:03:28.010> you

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
into an orbital so I'll do that for you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.449 
into an orbital so I'll do that for you
real<00:03:28.430> quick<00:03:29.530> link<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.680> close<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.069> handles

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
real quick link up close to the handles

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.020 
real quick link up close to the handles
on<00:03:31.790> front<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.329> you<00:03:32.419> quick<00:03:32.989> jerk<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:34.239> spin

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.869 

to<00:03:40.030> get<00:03:40.269> done<00:03:41.609> but<00:03:42.609> um<00:03:43.950> yeah<00:03:44.950> pretty<00:03:45.459> much<00:03:45.549> it

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
to get done but um yeah pretty much it

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.209 
to get done but um yeah pretty much it
so<00:03:47.790> real<00:03:48.790> quick<00:03:48.999> jerk<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:50.379> pull<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.590> again<00:03:50.950> if

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.219 
so real quick jerk and pull it again if

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.300 
so real quick jerk and pull it again if
you<00:03:51.370> want<00:03:51.400> kind<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.150> i<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.629> faster

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
you want kind of i get it going faster

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.830 
you want kind of i get it going faster
you<00:03:54.310> can<00:03:54.489> let<00:03:54.790> them<00:03:54.909> back<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.510> get<00:03:55.629> them<00:03:55.750> go

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
you can let them back in to get them go

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.640 
you can let them back in to get them go
slower<00:03:56.370> air<00:03:57.370> yo<00:03:57.639> got<00:03:57.939> out<00:03:58.200> and<00:04:00.780> ed's<00:04:01.780> uh<00:04:02.200> that's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
slower air yo got out and ed's uh that's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.539 
slower air yo got out and ed's uh that's
pretty<00:04:02.920> much<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:04.680> what<00:04:05.680> else<00:04:05.889> what<00:04:06.280> else<00:04:06.310> what

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
pretty much it what else what else what

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.629 
pretty much it what else what else what
else<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:07.889> don't<00:04:08.889> know<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.010> guess<00:04:09.189> that's<00:04:09.489> it

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
else I don't know I guess that's it

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.950 
else I don't know I guess that's it
practical<00:04:10.709> see<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.769> later
