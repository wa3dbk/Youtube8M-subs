00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.580
 well flavored and textured soy 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.120
 from the submerged that this I get 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.120
 easily 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:35.650
 in this way I go with a volume 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.650
 impressive learned and mixing 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.770
 of proportions the double-double but the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.750
 true that you will see it is going to hydrate 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.270
 easily and once it is 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.220
 hydrated weeks ago burgers what 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.150
 you have to put seasoning this and 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.100
 process it 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.130
 so that they stick so that you stay 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.130
 all right 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.110
 I do not like them aside I wanted to put that 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.720
 most searched word because it's parsley 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.720
 chopped parsley that you want 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 we are going to need 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.840
 the window we put ground chili 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.030
 we put the champion this we process and 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:39.220
 is going to stay a well well well and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.220
 wants to be like exactly what 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:02:01.360
 that needs an egg and this processed to 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 payment for obtaining a homogeneous mass 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.540
 you need what you have to do 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:15.970
 receive that I need a little more than 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:15.970
 body you put breadcrumbs and onions 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:25.739
 but if the shade well textured 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.599
 softened hydrated by the conduit with 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.970
 the addition of that mincemeat to which 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.120
 addict leave pretty much stuff 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.450
 a lot of carrot and a little garlic 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.450
 this pill gives you a little cold and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:54.440
 that is not amalgam of soy sauce 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:15.030
 in the freezer and if not directly the 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.030
 kitchen 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.350
 have any doubt 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.550
 and this is a kind of flavor and seasoning 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.290
 final makeup 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.280
 rich texture and in the same pan 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.280
 As if this were not enough 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.790
 it has everything 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.270
 and then I made that legal flour that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.020
 will let the local 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.020
 a question 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.770
 so that the one that is 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.770
 scatter that last view of life 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.340
 please 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.449
 it's good that you can put together a 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.370
 montonazo and strawberry guardian have is 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.330
 obvious you put separator a sachet 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.330
 for every time 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.449
 as always 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.639
 the lid 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.910
 and I will not give
