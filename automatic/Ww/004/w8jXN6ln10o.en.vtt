00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 very good people we are here with the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.990
 new champion of jeans this champion 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 crazy and here we see her dancing 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.940
 and well let's see a little bit what is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 the champion in action we just go 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 to see the skills and a little more 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.029
 which is because I'm a game that I 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 it has cost a lot to enter so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.980
 let's talk a little bit about what we're going 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 to see a little the myths of war 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 is in English because in Spanish too 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.670
 no I do not also have in Spanish yet 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.670
 the voices and well let's see the 1 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 Pretty good 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 but 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.740
 of hands 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.850
 so that the gun and such 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.850
 like now 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.370
 crazy duck 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.090
 part the player is left for the morning 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 and good as it returned 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.530
 and mounts 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.610
 ass and take by gender 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.610
 let's see more closely 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.050
 the most by far direct and good there 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.640
 we are with skills we are going to see a 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.880
 little passive passive to say that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.520
 good gives us the passive seal more in 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 Spanish the time croatia normal I think a 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.600
 butt stop is called the passive in 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.030
 Spanish and what it gives us is a speed 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.320
 of extra movement for four 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.530
 seconds every time we kill a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.980
 champion or we take them an enemy tower 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.800
 OK 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.900
 we go with the cv that is called change the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.920
 which is good to change weapons you see now 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.430
 have two more pink by we'll change to 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.300
 rocket launcher this vale 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.100
 the machine gun the f that changed what happens 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.790
 when you change this basically that with 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 the bazooka this inflicts is more damage and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.620
 you also spend human worth the problem is 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
 that you are going to spend more mana and with this 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.820
 basically the basic attacks ingesa and 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.290
 a little more cream I think it's not 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.570
 in English and I will not update 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.060
 slow but I do not know I think the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.770
 machine gun 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.400
 gives him attack speed or something like that 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.090
 during after five seconds good 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.099
 now we try it but now we're going 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.200
 to try the w in the cloud where 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.560
 basically what you are going to give is first 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.600
 let's do 140 of the year plus 30 more 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 140 of the year 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.740
 let's reveal where the champion is and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 we are going to produce a 30 the speed of 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.750
 movement for two seconds 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.770
 you will see now after a shot and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.380
 basically it reveals where the champion is 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.270
 and good more little things and basically 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.300
 ask the live movement game 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.320
 basically the e is that it does like 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.960
 decoys or as a copy of you and what 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.230
 does it basically exploits not 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.570
 infringe as undertakes and also reduces 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.430
 the movement game 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.430
 You see how they are like us 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:43.299
 and they explode and finally the multi 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.460
 which is the super mega rocket well let's go 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.300
 throwing basic attacks and such 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.300
 of 6 children 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.150
 so that it is raised 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.549
 we'll see 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 good 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.420
 now I have 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.530
 a cougar we have not seen very closely 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.460
 or more slowed shit 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.830
 well let's see how you die 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.380
 with zeal as a heart 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.380
 and there is death 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:57.440
 p 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:00.440
 well let's see now I'm going to put 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.440
 reducing 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.630
 so that it comes faster and until this 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.590
 is the champion basically the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.690
 skills is very good 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.870
 must fit as well the q 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.730
 you basically change your weapon and the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.150
 rocket launcher does more damage what happens 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.580
 this week 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.410
 and this they do not know what really makes the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.070
 machine gun I think more speed of 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.180
 attack the double cloud because you know 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.840
 movement speed and reveals where 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.190
 is the champion of these and in a 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:38.530
 super type a little bit more is very good 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.530
 and good that you see a little bit of the poet 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.530
 so you can see the bridge and again 15 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.060
 seconds then let's wait a lot with 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.050
 this 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.050
 20 seconds 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.050
 to see if children come out here at the moment 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.050
 They do not know 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.390
 Well I'm super rocket launch 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.890
 this one of the cojones 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.890
 but when the rank has the truth 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.770
 this does not put it 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.120
 here here with the range 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.340
 well let's see it 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.230
 I do not know how far to throw the rocket but 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.230
 I'm going to throw it to limit there 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.300
 and nothing else the champion is this 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.090
 mark here we see it let's get 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.639
 with this and nothing else 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.290
 and well, nothing else, this is the 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.940
 champion I hope you liked the 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.060
 true and also the champion is 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.479
 fun and a little more skills 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:02.139
 Well, we've already seen how the cloud changes 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:04.570
 double for this and good the champion paints 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.580
 that is going to be very difficult to change is 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.080
 say that the champion is enemy of 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.629
 view is not sister 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.600
 and little bit more the truth we said goodbye 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:18.720
 how are we going to start the video 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.460
 dancing and little else 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.440
 I'll have left some little things in another 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.140
 but as I said, I had to record the 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.320
 fast video there's a lot more that I could 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:31.260
 do and nothing because that this champion 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.240
 she is not a sister and she is an enemy a little bit more 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.240
 the truth the process history that goes 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.340
 I was against Picto and that's it 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.440
 the champion highlights is difficult to 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.249
 use mostly highlights we have to 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.710
 q handle very well and otherwise do 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:52.700
 It is very difficult to change thanks to the w 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:55.460
 this song is very white let 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:58.830
 time nothing else the game ends 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:02.730
 we have lost for a play in age 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.860
 and a little more when you can to upload a 

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.400
 video when I found or something like that 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.030
 in which we see it multiple nation 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.310
 we have that it's a little 

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.560
 skills and nothing people see you in 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.860
 another video because I also like it and we 

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.860
 we see
