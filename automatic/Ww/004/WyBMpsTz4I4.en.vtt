00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
first what was that an expectation that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
first what was that an expectation that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this was going to be something that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.889 
this was going to be something that
people<00:00:41.640> talked<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.420> played<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
of experience fits into that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.420 
of experience fits into that
gave<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.510> 9.5<00:01:53.020> space<00:01:53.470> from<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.190> audience

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
stuff every day for a really long time

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.370 
stuff every day for a really long time
and<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.150> think<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.960> know<00:01:59.020> that's<00:01:59.230> why

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
and I think that you know that's why

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.900 
and I think that you know that's why
it's<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.620> well<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.310> gave<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.700> high

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
it's like well you gave this a high

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's like well you gave this a high
score<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:01.570> not<00:02:01.690> even<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.990> game<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.470> know

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
score but it's not even a game you know

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.620 
score but it's not even a game you know
it's<00:02:02.830> kind<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.280> why<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.850> became<00:02:04.270> part<00:02:04.510> of<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
it's kind of why that became part of the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.510 
it's kind of why that became part of the
narrative<00:02:04.810> gone<00:02:05.350> home<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.860> not<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.460> traditional

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
narrative gone home is not a traditional

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.390 
narrative gone home is not a traditional
like<00:02:10.170> triple-a<00:02:11.170> style<00:02:11.560> game<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.160> lot<00:02:12.280> of

or kind of make those interpretations

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.650 
or kind of make those interpretations
yourself<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:00.820> think<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.420> know<00:03:01.510> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.120 
name you've built this whole mental map
of<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:51.080> just<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.560> floor<00:03:51.770> plan<00:03:51.800> of<00:03:52.070> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
of not just like the floor plan of the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.040 
of not just like the floor plan of the
house<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:52.460> how<00:03:52.640> right<00:03:53.240> interconnects<00:03:53.960> and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
house but how right interconnects and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.820 
house but how right interconnects and
what<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> secret<00:03:55.390> ways<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.720> get<00:03:56.990> from<00:03:57.290> point<00:03:57.710> A

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
what the secret ways to get from point A

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.370 
what the secret ways to get from point A
to<00:03:57.890> point<00:03:57.980> B<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.170> thought<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.290> was

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
to point B are and so I thought it was

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.340 
to point B are and so I thought it was
really<00:04:00.590> valuable<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:01.010> be<00:04:01.190> able<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.430> say

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
really valuable to be able to say

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.750 
really valuable to be able to say
getting<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> last<00:04:04.520> room

of what happened there and we're you
know<00:05:42.410> we're<00:05:42.530> building<00:05:43.130> on<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.400> right<00:05:43.669> because

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
know we're building on it right because

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.790 
know we're building on it right because
we<00:05:44.000> don't<00:05:44.180> want<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.479> repeat<00:05:44.990> ourselves<00:05:45.259> and

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
we don't want to repeat ourselves and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.710 
we don't want to repeat ourselves and
just<00:05:45.830> say<00:05:46.039> well<00:05:46.190> let's<00:05:46.310> do<00:05:46.550> another<00:05:47.180> house

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
just say well let's do another house

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.510 
just say well let's do another house
with<00:05:48.229> stuff<00:05:48.440> in<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.680> yeah<00:05:48.979> what's<00:05:49.190> different

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
with stuff in it yeah what's different

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.270 
with stuff in it yeah what's different
out<00:05:49.610> but<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.240> think<00:05:50.539> that<00:05:50.599> that<00:05:50.720> we<00:05:51.190> created<00:05:52.190> a

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
out but I think that that we created a

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.279 
out but I think that that we created a
really<00:05:52.520> strong<00:05:52.729> interactive<00:05:53.330> base<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.020> gone

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
really strong interactive base and gone

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.170 
really strong interactive base and gone
home<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.740> like<00:05:54.889> being<00:05:55.340> in<00:05:55.460> a<00:05:55.550> place<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:55.970> being

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
home of like being in a place and being

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.510 
home of like being in a place and being
able<00:05:56.360> to<00:05:56.780> write<00:05:57.199> to<00:05:57.470> draw<00:05:57.740> meaning<00:05:57.949> out<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.280> it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
able to write to draw meaning out of it

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.540 
able to write to draw meaning out of it
so<00:05:59.090> taking<00:05:59.449> that<00:05:59.479> and<00:05:59.949> taking<00:06:00.949> the<00:06:01.099> next<00:06:01.280> step

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
so taking that and taking the next step

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.520 
so taking that and taking the next step
that<00:06:01.940> builds<00:06:02.660> on<00:06:02.780> it<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.050> makes<00:06:03.199> our<00:06:03.320> next

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
that builds on it and makes our next

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.260 
that builds on it and makes our next
game<00:06:03.680> feel<00:06:03.949> like<00:06:04.099> it<00:06:04.220> also<00:06:04.490> stands<00:06:04.880> on<00:06:05.030> its<00:06:05.180> own

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
game feel like it also stands on its own

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.499 
game feel like it also stands on its own
right<00:06:05.750> is<00:06:05.990> really<00:06:06.229> important<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.710> us<00:06:06.979> because
