00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
labs digital handheld base meter now

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.410 
labs digital handheld base meter now
this<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.589> exactly<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.370> same<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.970> term<00:00:09.120> lab

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
this is exactly the same as the term lab

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.900 
this is exactly the same as the term lab
you<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.380> meter<00:00:10.620> reader<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> you

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
you have the meter reader there and you

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.720 
you have the meter reader there and you
have<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.599> sensor<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.400> has<00:00:14.549> been

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
have the sensor there now this has been

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.670 
have the sensor there now this has been
tested<00:00:15.240> against<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> term<00:00:16.080> lab<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
tested against the term lab and is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680 
tested against the term lab and is
accurate<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.340> naught<00:00:17.520> point<00:00:17.820> naught<00:00:18.210> to

accurate to naught point naught to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
accurate to naught point naught to
decibel<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:20.160> accurate<00:00:20.550> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
decibel so it's very very accurate to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.730 
decibel so it's very very accurate to
the<00:00:20.670> term<00:00:20.910> lab<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> you'll<00:00:22.080> even<00:00:22.230> find<00:00:22.529> these

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the term lab and you'll even find these

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
the term lab and you'll even find these
differences<00:00:23.189> between<00:00:23.400> term<00:00:23.910> lab<00:00:24.090> systems<00:00:24.510> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
differences between term lab systems so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.790 
differences between term lab systems so
what<00:00:26.039> I've<00:00:26.160> got<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.449> powerful<00:00:28.199> 2k

I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.390> tuned<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> around<00:00:45.960> 30<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.620> 33

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I think it's tuned to around 30 to 33

sub<00:03:30.550> in<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.000> big<00:03:31.180> room<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.140> colloid

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
sub in a big room like this in a colloid

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.430 
sub in a big room like this in a colloid
probably<00:03:32.860> be<00:03:33.010> about<00:03:33.250> 135<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:34.060> reckon<00:03:34.510> let's<00:03:35.200> try

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
probably be about 135 I reckon let's try

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.399 
probably be about 135 I reckon let's try
a<00:03:35.470> quick<00:03:35.650> 35

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.910 

similar<00:03:44.409> on<00:03:44.530> 33.1

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.710 

3<00:03:52.550> subs<00:03:53.550> getting<00:03:53.819> pretty<00:03:54.060> warm<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.569> it's<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
3 subs getting pretty warm and it's a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.850 
3 subs getting pretty warm and it's a
little<00:03:54.959> smelly<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.650> that's

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
little smelly over here that's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.260 
little smelly over here that's
definitely<00:03:56.220> warming<00:03:56.550> through<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.760> cone<00:03:57.030> I

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
definitely warming through the cone I

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.580 
definitely warming through the cone I
said<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.660> pool<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.990> I've<00:03:58.110> had<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.260> fill<00:03:58.470> up

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
said the pool so I've had a fill up

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.770 
said the pool so I've had a fill up
inside<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:59.220> Motors<00:03:59.850> definitely<00:04:00.240> warm<00:04:00.450> so

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
inside there Motors definitely warm so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.090 
inside there Motors definitely warm so
that's<00:04:00.870> probably<00:04:01.200> about<00:04:01.290> its<00:04:01.530> limits<00:04:01.890> there

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
that's probably about its limits there

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.190 
that's probably about its limits there
it's<00:04:02.730> definitely<00:04:03.000> getting<00:04:03.120> well<00:04:03.390> over<00:04:03.420> 2k<00:04:03.780> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
it's definitely getting well over 2k I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.660 
it's definitely getting well over 2k I
did<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.500> voltmeter<00:04:04.740> on<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.040> last<00:04:05.190> time<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
did have a voltmeter on it last time and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.330 
did have a voltmeter on it last time and
I<00:04:05.820> didn't<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.270> time<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:08.160> got

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
I didn't do it this time but I have got

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.280 
I didn't do it this time but I have got
a<00:04:08.430> SPO<00:04:08.910> lavs<00:04:09.209> meter<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.840> way<00:04:10.020> which<00:04:10.200> will

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
a SPO lavs meter on the way which will

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.870 
a SPO lavs meter on the way which will
tell<00:04:10.500> me<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> amount<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.980> what's<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.760> my

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
tell me the amount of what's going to my

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.240 
tell me the amount of what's going to my
sub<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.270> how<00:04:12.390> many<00:04:12.570> amps<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> ambe's

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
sub and how many amps the ambe's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.620 
sub and how many amps the ambe's
actually<00:04:14.489> drawing<00:04:14.700> from<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> power<00:04:15.270> system

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
actually drawing from the power system

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.880 
actually drawing from the power system
they'll<00:04:15.989> be<00:04:16.079> really<00:04:16.290> handy<00:04:16.440> I'll<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.739> able<00:04:16.799> to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
they'll be really handy I'll be able to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.349 
they'll be really handy I'll be able to
tell<00:04:17.070> exactly<00:04:17.160> how<00:04:17.459> many<00:04:17.669> watts<00:04:17.910> is<00:04:18.060> going<00:04:18.269> to

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
tell exactly how many watts is going to

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.210 
tell exactly how many watts is going to
this<00:04:18.450> sub<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.810> then<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.859> yeah<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
this sub just then but yeah in the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.890 
this sub just then but yeah in the
meantime<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:20.760> very<00:04:21.030> very<00:04:21.239> impressed<00:04:21.630> with

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
meantime I'm very very impressed with

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.310 
meantime I'm very very impressed with
those<00:04:22.049> results<00:04:22.610> 133<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.540> really<00:04:24.900> growing

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
those results 133 in a really growing

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.780 
those results 133 in a really growing
vironment<00:04:25.650> like<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.040> from<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.370> cheap<00:04:26.550> sub

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
vironment like this from a cheap sub

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.060 
vironment like this from a cheap sub
like<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.090> on<00:04:27.360> big<00:04:27.720> power<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.320> bad<00:04:28.500> at<00:04:28.770> all

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
like that on big power is not bad at all

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.850 
like that on big power is not bad at all
and<00:04:29.480> it's<00:04:30.480> very<00:04:30.720> difficult<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.169> fill<00:04:31.380> up<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.650> big

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
and it's very difficult to fill up a big

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310 
and it's very difficult to fill up a big
room<00:04:32.160> like<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.880> SPL<00:04:33.510> in<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.960> car<00:04:34.169> it's

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
room like this with SPL in the car it's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.630 
room like this with SPL in the car it's
much<00:04:34.440> easier<00:04:34.800> you're<00:04:34.950> much<00:04:35.040> closer<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.550> the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
much easier you're much closer to the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.700 
much easier you're much closer to the
subs<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.090> more<00:04:36.240> less<00:04:36.419> air<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.840> move<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.530> much

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
subs is more less air to move it's much

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.740 
subs is more less air to move it's much
easier<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.580> reckon<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.270> car<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.630> would

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
easier so I reckon in a car this would

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.070 
easier so I reckon in a car this would
be<00:04:39.840> sitting<00:04:40.169> well<00:04:40.350> over<00:04:40.620> 135<00:04:41.690> really<00:04:42.690> not<00:04:42.840> bad

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
be sitting well over 135 really not bad

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.920 
be sitting well over 135 really not bad
for<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.770> little<00:04:44.220> single<00:04:44.910> 12-inch<00:04:45.330> lava<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
for a little single 12-inch lava in a

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.480 
for a little single 12-inch lava in a
really<00:04:46.440> box<00:04:46.680> he's<00:04:46.890> not<00:04:47.010> even<00:04:47.220> designed

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
really box he's not even designed

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.090 
really box he's not even designed
properly<00:04:47.669> for<00:04:48.000> it
