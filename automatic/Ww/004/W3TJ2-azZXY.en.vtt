onto<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.550> little<00:05:07.820> pattern<00:05:08.240> started<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.080> expand

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
onto a little pattern started to expand

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.960 
onto a little pattern started to expand
it<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> little<00:05:09.770> bit<00:05:10.010> yeah<00:05:10.460> we<00:05:10.699> just<00:05:10.820> started

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
it a little bit yeah we just started

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.689 
it a little bit yeah we just started
observed<00:05:11.600> going<00:05:12.290> shallower<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.520> that's

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
observed going shallower and that's

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.100 
observed going shallower and that's
where<00:05:13.880> they<00:05:14.030> did<00:05:14.180> sort<00:05:14.419> of<00:05:14.449> catching<00:05:14.780> more<00:05:14.930> and
