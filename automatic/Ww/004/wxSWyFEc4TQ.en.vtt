working with round objects and Mod Podge
now<00:00:15.770> this<00:00:15.949> technique<00:00:16.280> works<00:00:16.520> great<00:00:16.970> on<00:00:17.000> the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
now this technique works great on the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.029 
now this technique works great on the
small<00:00:17.510> objects<00:00:17.960> but<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.230> also<00:00:18.380> excrete<00:00:18.920> on

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
small objects but it also excrete on

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.910 
small objects but it also excrete on
larger<00:00:19.580> objects<00:00:20.179> like<00:00:20.660> lampshade<00:00:21.320> now<00:00:21.769> we

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
larger objects like lampshade now we

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.890 
larger objects like lampshade now we
like<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.220> use<00:00:22.310> wrapping<00:00:22.880> paper<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.539> make<00:00:23.720> the

into the cup along the bottom edge

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440 
into the cup along the bottom edge
you'll<00:01:41.830> scrunch<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.490> paper<00:01:42.729> around<00:01:43.030> the

bottom use a pencil to sketch along the
top<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.270> bottom<00:01:49.390> edge<00:01:52.410> remove<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.650> paper

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.930 

on<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.390> last<00:02:04.690> folded<00:02:05.500> edge<00:02:05.770> you'll<00:02:06.610> draw<00:02:06.910> a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
on the last folded edge you'll draw a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.680 
on the last folded edge you'll draw a
line<00:02:07.360> about<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> half<00:02:08.110> inch<00:02:08.320> from<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.860> edge

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
line about a half inch from the edge

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.680 
line about a half inch from the edge
this<00:02:10.690> will<00:02:10.899> create<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.320> little<00:02:11.770> overlap<00:02:12.690> trim

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this will create the little overlap trim

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.860 
this will create the little overlap trim
along<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:14.140> pencil<00:02:14.560> lines<00:02:15.480> cut<00:02:16.480> along<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
along your pencil lines cut along the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
along your pencil lines cut along the
overlap<00:02:17.440> line<00:02:17.740> make<00:02:18.430> sure<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:18.940> cut<00:02:19.180> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
overlap line make sure that you cut in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.230 
overlap line make sure that you cut in
between<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> paper<00:02:20.050> layers<00:02:20.820> fold<00:02:21.820> back<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
between the paper layers fold back the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.230 
between the paper layers fold back the
overlap<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.960> tape<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.410> secure

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.540 

you<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.200> how<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.530> easily<00:02:32.040> creates<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you can see how this easily creates a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.930 
you can see how this easily creates a
template<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.370> easy<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.850> is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
template so you can see how easy it is

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
template so you can see how easy it is
to<00:02:39.120> make<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> paper<00:02:39.600> template<00:02:40.050> now<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.620> step

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
to make a paper template now this step

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.950 
to make a paper template now this step
is<00:02:41.130> super<00:02:41.610> important<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.210> only<00:02:42.390> takes<00:02:42.720> a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
is super important and it only takes a
