it's<00:04:47.970> also<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.240> problem<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> can't<00:04:48.930> train

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
it's also a problem that you can't train

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.570 
it's also a problem that you can't train
much<00:04:49.530> more<00:04:49.770> than<00:04:49.920> six<00:04:50.130> different<00:04:50.430> pokemon

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580

of depth and it's the biggest plus to
the<00:04:58.560> game<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.220> 17<00:04:59.640> different<00:04:59.760> types<00:05:00.090> also<00:05:00.720> add
