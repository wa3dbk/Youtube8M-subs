00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello to all guys from androidblog.it 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.120
 today we are doing 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.289
 review of a very application 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.130
 I use it very pretty and functional 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 always because sometimes I often do 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.320
 I find out of the house and maybe it can be 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.470
 interesting to see some programs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.539
 television from the phone when not 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 we have a television and I have to say that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.430
 this program is the best one is called 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:43.469
 tv can be found in full version 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 even on the market it costs two dollars if 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.670
 I remember correctly I am at around 99 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.079
 penny anyway something like that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 since I've already bought some 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 time and I must say that it is an application 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.260
 which works very well in my opinion 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.820
 it is the only one that works so well 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 problem I had at least for me 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 personally it was for the mediaset channels 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.180
 more notes I often went out to find on others 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.189
 platforms and I must say that here channels 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.229
 never restive they are seen very very well 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 for me who are passionate about motogp 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.670
 when I'm not at home, crush Italy 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.049
 1 and I must say that immediately today 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.659
 accidentally there is also the gp e bike 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 so here we are that we are ready to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.180
 see the motogp only you have respected 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.650
 from talmacsi I don't know if you remember me 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.280
 he had told a mechanic who has 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.409
 worked with a dog he really had 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 the visibility of these is excellent 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 fluid programs without any kind of 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 problem 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:54.270
 we have also, however, apologized for 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:56.840
 I remove the audio I take off the audio and say 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.240
 let's see what the programs are 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 included in this application we have 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 raiuno raidue raitre retequattro channel 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.790
 5 italiauno we have the 7 rai4 rai5 rai 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.119
 movie rai premium 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.570
 la yoyo rai gulp rai story rai sport 1 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.740
 rai sport 2 euro sports also 1 and 2 rai 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.120
 news and also sky tg24 tgcom24 that runs 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.840
 yo mydeejay euronews and tg norba 24 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.360
 so for example let's try sky tg24 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.910
 as you can see also sky tg24 does not give any 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 kind of problem in the vision too 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 the audio that I was removed can raise it up again 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.070
 well now maybe some of you can 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.890
 tell me it's ok but mauro if I don't have the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.150
 wifi back to back anyway 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.670
 an area where covered wifi certainly 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.310
 I will have problems using the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.190
 phone, but no because of course 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.890
 for those who have a subscription then with a 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.690
 little bit of jig to be exploited naturally 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 occupies much less than a jig of 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.030
 a few jigs I saw a motorcycle race gp 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.010
 it is a program, but know that you are there 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.540
 a non-100 mega subscription let's say 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.519
 however, the telephone does it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.380
 the application warns us that inspection 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.480
 it is not connected in wifi but we say of 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.560
 continue the same and for example 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.610
 this time we say we want 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.459
 see 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.570
 I don't know melaverde summer on channel 5 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.980
 we wait a moment and the phone e 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.830
 then the application itself answers 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.590
 great as you can well see 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.880
 although we are attacked with networks in 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.010
 this case of 3 italia h3g the phone 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.690
 this appears to be fluid 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.489
 application turns out to be fantastic 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.450
 manages buffering at its best 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.190
 then streaming this video 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.210
 channel in this case of mediaset and ci 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.660
 then allows you to view 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.070
 beautifully then every channel between 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.860
 those we have already seen before in 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.740
 list also under note 3g h spa network 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.930
 and therefore I must say excellent this great 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.980
 I remind you this program is called TV 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:23.280
 just go to the play store you are looking for tv 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.460
 and here it is of stefano galiziana yes 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.890
 find here just do install costs 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.360
 I remember now I don't remember precisely the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.670
 price because I already bought it from 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 some time before the review but if 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.960
 I remember correctly they were in about not 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.990
 up to a maximum of 99 euro cents 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.320
 we were there so I have to say 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:47.210
 an exceptional application as far as 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.990
 regards the visibility of the channels 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.410
 TV shows up on android that works 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.860
 exceptionally perfectly also 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.810
 with skilful 3g nets cod that mine 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.510
 area is not covered by internet ultrÃ  from 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.090
 4g etc. so any person who 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.430
 is covered by 3g network at that spa 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.290
 here almost all of Italy can be 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.840
 and can use this device 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.430
 also in this application also in 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.160
 mobility on every android device 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.200
 all good for this tv review e 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.700
 See you at the next review by 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.570
 applications or phones as usual 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.570
 Hi everyone
