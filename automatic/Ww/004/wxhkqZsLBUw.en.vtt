situation<00:00:24.869> although<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.130> might<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.400> work

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
situation although this might not work

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.359 
situation although this might not work
if<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.289> go<00:00:28.289> too<00:00:28.349> far<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> bunch<00:00:29.220> of

if you like go too far with a bunch of
TNT<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:29.789> something<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.260> generally

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
TNT or something but this is generally

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
TNT or something but this is generally
how<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.890> works<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.430> basically<00:00:33.000> what's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
how it works so basically what's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.340 
how it works so basically what's
actually<00:00:34.880> makes<00:00:35.880> minecraft<00:00:36.390> lag<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
actually makes minecraft lag is when you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.330 
actually makes minecraft lag is when you
have<00:00:37.530> too<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:38.489> entities<00:00:39.149> who<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.340> doing

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
have too much entities who are doing

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
have too much entities who are doing
something<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.940> mean<00:00:42.090> how<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.660> resent<00:00:43.140> so

viewer distance as low as possible for
no<00:01:49.860> lagg<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.390> no

basically when you take a bucket oh wait
a<00:01:59.399> second<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.479> put<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> tree<00:02:01.079> you're

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
a second and you put it on a tree you're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
a second and you put it on a tree you're
going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.100> flows<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> has

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to see that it flows and it has

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.630 
going to see that it flows and it has
like<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.540> animation<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.460> go

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
like the animation on it but if I go

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
like the animation on it but if I go
ahead<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.880> turn<00:02:06.329> off<00:02:06.360> animated<00:02:07.259> water<00:02:07.500> you're

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
ahead and turn off animated water you're

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.830 
ahead and turn off animated water you're
gonna<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> water<00:02:08.429> stops<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
gonna see the water stops now that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.650 
gonna see the water stops now that
prevents

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
prevents

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.560 
prevents
that<00:02:11.050> actually<00:02:11.530> helps<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.580> although<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
that actually helps you and although it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.330 
that actually helps you and although it
is<00:02:13.690> pretty<00:02:13.930> ugly<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.890> same<00:02:15.100> things

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
is pretty ugly here is the same things

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.330 
is pretty ugly here is the same things
goes<00:02:15.550> with<00:02:15.970> water<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.780> can't<00:02:17.340> put

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
goes with water so if you can't put

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.460 
goes with water so if you can't put
something<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.790> fire<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.390> gonna<00:02:19.720> glitch<00:02:20.110> in

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
something on fire it's gonna glitch in

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.890 
something on fire it's gonna glitch in
this<00:02:20.650> weird<00:02:21.070> thingy<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.480> same<00:02:22.660> things

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
this weird thingy and the same things

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.100 
this weird thingy and the same things
goes<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.590> lava<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.250> if<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.550> put<00:02:24.760> lava<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.480> here

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
goes with lava so if I put lava up here

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.160 
goes with lava so if I put lava up here
ah<00:02:26.370> let's<00:02:27.370> say<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.570> guys<00:02:28.750> won't<00:02:28.990> be

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's like stay in its water position and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.750 
it's like stay in its water position and
you<00:02:35.200> won't<00:02:35.380> be<00:02:35.530> seeing<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.220> which<00:02:36.520> you're

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
seeing now so the lava is like boiling

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.440 
seeing now so the lava is like boiling
and<00:02:39.730> stuff

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and stuff

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.160 
and stuff
as<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.080> ah<00:02:41.290> now<00:02:42.070> let's<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:43.170> take

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
as you can see ah now let's just take

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
as you can see ah now let's just take
care<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.550> one<00:02:45.730> second<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.360> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
care of this for just one second so it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.680 
care of this for just one second so it
won't<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:48.160> everything<00:02:48.700> later<00:02:48.940> although<00:02:49.540> we

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
won't like everything later although we

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.930 
won't like everything later although we
are<00:02:50.110> probably<00:02:50.710> gonna<00:02:50.860> burn<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.310> forest<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
are probably gonna burn this forest so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.930 
are probably gonna burn this forest so
yeah<00:02:52.980> we're<00:02:53.980> pretty<00:02:54.130> much<00:02:54.280> gonna<00:02:54.520> lag<00:02:54.760> so

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
yeah we're pretty much gonna lag so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.970 
yeah we're pretty much gonna lag so
that's<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.390> more<00:02:55.660> things<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:56.410> something's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
that's one of more things if something's

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
turn that on you are actually being able

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
turn that on you are actually being able
to<00:03:25.209> see<00:03:25.630> through<00:03:26.200> leaves<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.740> now<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.860> am

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to see through leaves and now I am

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.400 
to see through leaves and now I am
getting<00:03:27.580> some<00:03:28.090> lag<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.690> I'm<00:03:28.780> sure<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.140> will

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
be getting some lag as well so as you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.350 
be getting some lag as well so as you
can<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:32.050> around<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.740> you<00:03:33.490> can<00:03:33.700> actually<00:03:34.060> see

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
can see around here you can actually see

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.720 
can see around here you can actually see
through<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.840> trees<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.740> can<00:03:35.920> see<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.370> that's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
through the trees you can see so that's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.120 
through the trees you can see so that's
fancy<00:03:37.000> graphics<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.810> if<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.500> turn<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:38.800> off

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
fancy graphics and if you turn that off

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.000 
fancy graphics and if you turn that off
you're<00:03:39.520> pretty<00:03:39.790> much<00:03:40.050> gonna<00:03:41.050> be<00:03:41.170> getting<00:03:41.709> much

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
you're pretty much gonna be getting much

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.590 
you're pretty much gonna be getting much
smoother<00:03:42.370> gameplay<00:03:42.520> now<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:43.330> hide

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
smoother gameplay now this is just hide

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.900 
smoother gameplay now this is just hide
it's<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.410> gonna<00:03:44.530> hide<00:03:44.830> like<00:03:45.459> your<00:03:45.700> hotbar

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
it's just gonna hide like your hotbar

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.270 
it's just gonna hide like your hotbar
and<00:03:46.300> stuff<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.660> does<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:46.959> do<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.440> lot<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
and stuff it does not do a lot to the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.690 
and stuff it does not do a lot to the
gameplay<00:03:48.730> itself<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:50.470> yeah<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:50.860> let's<00:03:51.130> let

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
gameplay itself but yeah now let's let

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.940 
gameplay itself but yeah now let's let
me<00:03:51.850> show<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> what<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.110> lag<00:03:53.320> so<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.830> is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
me show you what is lag so this is

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.180 
me show you what is lag so this is
basically<00:03:54.220> how<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.430> will<00:03:55.150> lag<00:03:55.540> out<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.650> Willits

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
basically how it will lag out on Willits

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.100 
basically how it will lag out on Willits
because<00:03:57.730> for<00:03:58.120> me<00:03:58.270> it<00:03:58.510> has<00:03:58.690> been<00:03:58.870> running

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
because for me it has been running

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.290 
because for me it has been running
pretty<00:03:59.320> smoothly<00:03:59.770> but<00:04:00.520> for<00:04:00.700> some<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.120> on

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
pretty smoothly but for some of you on

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.630 
pretty smoothly but for some of you on
older<00:04:01.720> devices<00:04:02.050> this<00:04:02.380> might<00:04:02.650> lag<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.130> what

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
older devices this might lag but what

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.920 
older devices this might lag but what
I'm<00:04:03.760> doing<00:04:03.790> now<00:04:04.239> is<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.570> I'm<00:04:04.720> running
