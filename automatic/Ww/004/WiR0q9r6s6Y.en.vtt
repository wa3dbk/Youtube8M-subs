g 7.1 Brandon Roberts signature wheels
first<00:00:12.900> we're<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.500> going<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> start<00:00:13.830> off<00:00:13.950> at

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
first we're just going to start off at

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.029 
first we're just going to start off at
the<00:00:14.190> color<00:00:14.460> there<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> dark<00:00:16.289> gray<00:00:16.650> light

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the color there like a dark gray light

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.359 
the color there like a dark gray light
black<00:00:17.910> if<00:00:18.420> there<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.869> subject<00:00:19.470> color<00:00:19.740> i<00:00:19.890> really

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
black if there is subject color i really

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.189 
black if there is subject color i really
don't<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.300> could<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.840> compared

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
don't know but you could see it compared

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
don't know but you could see it compared
to<00:00:22.320> rip<00:00:22.529> tape<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.670> black<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
to rip tape it's black it's just a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.570 
to rip tape it's black it's just a
little<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.170> lighter<00:00:25.350> i'm<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:26.189> darker<00:00:26.490> than

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
little bit lighter i'm with darker than

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.730 
little bit lighter i'm with darker than
gray<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.390> pretty<00:00:27.510> neat<00:00:28.019> color<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
gray I think it's pretty neat color and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.209 
gray I think it's pretty neat color and
then<00:00:29.840> now<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> material<00:00:31.529> its<00:00:32.000> twenty<00:00:33.000> percent

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
then now the material its twenty percent

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
then now the material its twenty percent
Teflon<00:00:35.219> material<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:36.390> Teflon<00:00:36.630> bushings<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
Teflon material like Teflon bushings and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
Teflon material like Teflon bushings and
then<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.309> eighty<00:00:38.550> percent<00:00:38.730> D<00:00:39.090> material<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
then it's eighty percent D material and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
then it's eighty percent D material and
the<00:00:40.200> DS<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.800> pretty<00:00:41.550> soft<00:00:41.850> they're<00:00:42.300> not

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the DS are pretty soft they're not

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
the DS are pretty soft they're not
exactly<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:44.190> softest<00:00:44.670> wheels<00:00:44.940> they're

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
exactly like the softest wheels they're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
exactly like the softest wheels they're
not<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> hardest<00:00:45.930> wheels<00:00:46.579> um<00:00:47.750> yeah<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.110> these

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
not the hardest wheels um yeah in these

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.510 
not the hardest wheels um yeah in these
wheels<00:00:50.219> were<00:00:50.430> fifty<00:00:50.789> seven<00:00:51.120> dollars<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
wheels were fifty seven dollars and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
wheels were fifty seven dollars and
they're<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.239> cool<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:56.100> how

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
they're just really cool you can see how

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.549 
they're just really cool you can see how
smooth<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.800> here<00:00:58.800> that<00:01:00.320> there's<00:01:01.320> no

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
smooth they are here that there's no

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.850 
smooth they are here that there's no
like<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.510> don't<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.710> like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
like I don't know they don't get like

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.789 
like I don't know they don't get like
dirt<00:01:05.189> inside<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.000> make<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.420> like

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
dirt inside them to make it all like

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.990 
dirt inside them to make it all like
like<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.549> sounds<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
like that it just sounds like that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
like that it just sounds like that
because<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.240> running<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> crack<00:01:10.110> it's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
because I'm running over a crack it's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.780 
because I'm running over a crack it's
what<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:12.320> they're<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.860> smooth<00:01:14.369> wheels

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
what yeah they're really smooth wheels

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.570 
what yeah they're really smooth wheels
they're<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.479> fast<00:01:15.869> wheels<00:01:16.170> like

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
they're not really fast wheels like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.810 
they're not really fast wheels like
they're<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.439> average<00:01:19.439> roll<00:01:19.890> wheels

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
they're just like average roll wheels

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.870 
they're just like average roll wheels
but<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.810> smoothness<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.009> crazy

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
but the smoothness is just like crazy

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990 
but the smoothness is just like crazy
like<00:01:24.840> winkler<00:01:25.560> wheels<00:01:25.770> they're<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.700> fast

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
like winkler wheels they're really fast

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.690 
like winkler wheels they're really fast
wheels<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.810> they're<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.040> hard

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
wheels but they're all really hard

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.810 
wheels but they're all really hard
wheels<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> Griffey

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
wheels and they're not that Griffey

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.510 
wheels and they're not that Griffey
these<00:01:32.820> wheels<00:01:33.060> they're<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:34.520> perfect

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
these wheels they're just like perfect

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.289 
these wheels they're just like perfect
speed<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:37.320> insanely<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.610> buttering

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
speed and like insanely just buttering

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.920 
speed and like insanely just buttering
like<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.880> sit<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.899> like

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
like I I could just sit here going like

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.060 
like I I could just sit here going like
this<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.860> hours<00:01:43.890> because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
this for hours because

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.010 
this for hours because
there<00:01:45.340> they<00:01:45.790> just<00:01:45.820> feel<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.210> awesome<00:01:46.690> and

there they just feel that awesome and
like<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:48.360> guess<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.870> words<00:01:50.080> Brandon<00:01:50.650> Robert

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
like I guess in the words Brandon Robert

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.830 
like I guess in the words Brandon Robert
