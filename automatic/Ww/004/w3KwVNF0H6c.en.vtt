00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it'll paste it from this side so the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.590 
it'll paste it from this side so the
left<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> slash<00:00:31.260> slash<00:00:31.500> copy<00:00:31.980> and

this way you're going to do slash /

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.170 
this way you're going to do slash /
paste

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
paste

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
paste
well<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.530> pastes<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> behind<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
well that pastes it behind you and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.209 
well that pastes it behind you and
that's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.360> wanted<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.070> get

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that's not what you wanted you can get

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
that's not what you wanted you can get
rid<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> do

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
rid of that but what we're going to do

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
rid of that but what we're going to do
is<00:00:49.079> slash<00:00:49.289> undo<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> show<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is slash undo and I'm going to show you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
is slash undo and I'm going to show you
out<00:00:51.000> doing<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.629> you're<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.260> now

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
out doing what you're going to do is now

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
out doing what you're going to do is now
it's<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.309> clipboard<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.030> slash

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's on your clipboard so you do slash

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's on your clipboard so you do slash
slash<00:00:54.710> flip<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.149> now<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:58.250> think<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.370> what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
slash flip and now I think about what

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.959 
slash flip and now I think about what
this<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.730> does

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
this one does

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.100 
this one does
and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.629> slash<00:01:00.870> /<00:01:01.079> paste<00:01:02.239> now<00:01:03.239> what

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and then you do slash / paste now what

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
and then you do slash / paste now what
it<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> exact<00:01:04.920> top<00:01:05.129> goes<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it is it's the exact top goes from that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.550 
it is it's the exact top goes from that
way<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:09.049> maybe<00:01:10.049> exactly<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
way to that way maybe exactly how you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.899 
way to that way maybe exactly how you
wanted<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.830> it's<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:13.950> simple<00:01:14.400> now

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
wanted it so it's pretty simple now

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
wanted it so it's pretty simple now
we'll<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.509> rotate<00:01:16.049> though<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> have

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
we'll do the rotate though so you have

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
we'll do the rotate though so you have
this<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.939> slash<00:01:18.210> slash

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this and you want to do slash slash

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.770 
this and you want to do slash slash
rotate<00:01:19.549> 90<00:01:20.549> degrees<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> rotate<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
rotate 90 degrees it's going to rotate a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.530 
rotate 90 degrees it's going to rotate a
90<00:01:22.020> degrees<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:23.150> slash<00:01:24.150> slash<00:01:24.360> paste<00:01:26.540> now

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
90 degrees so do slash slash paste now

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
90 degrees so do slash slash paste now
let<00:01:27.720> me<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:29.070> rotated<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.060> 90

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
let me out it rotated it this way 90

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.859 
let me out it rotated it this way 90
degrees<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.470> 180<00:01:32.430> degrees<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
degrees so 180 degrees would just be the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
degrees so 180 degrees would just be the
same<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.320> flipping<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
same as flipping it but you know we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
same as flipping it but you know we
could<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> put<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.680> same<00:01:37.860> spot<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.640> it'd

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
could to put it like same spot so it'd

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.469 
could to put it like same spot so it'd
be<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.329> flipping<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:41.479> 260

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
be the same as flipping it but 260

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.819 
be the same as flipping it but 260
degrees<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.829> what

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
degrees or that's not right is it what

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.090 
degrees or that's not right is it what
am<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.009> thinking<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.409> 260

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
am I thinking now that is right so 260

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.510 
am I thinking now that is right so 260
degrees<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.000> putting<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> way<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
degrees would be putting it that way so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
degrees would be putting it that way so
so<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.579> thought<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> should<00:01:53.909> rotate<00:01:54.180> oh<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.560> do

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so I thought I should rotate oh you do

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.459 
so I thought I should rotate oh you do
another<00:01:56.250> 90<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.420> value<00:01:57.960> 180

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
another 90 or value 180

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.690 
another 90 or value 180
oh<00:01:59.210> no<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.450> dumb<00:02:00.689> okay<00:02:01.110> rotate<00:02:01.710> 180

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
oh no I'm so dumb okay rotate 180

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
oh no I'm so dumb okay rotate 180
degrees<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.869> already<00:02:04.140> still

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
degrees I think it's already still

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.570 
degrees I think it's already still
rotated<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.329> now<00:02:06.329> we'll<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:07.160> slash<00:02:08.160> slash

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.520 

paste<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.030> should<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.690> way

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
paste and it should go that way

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220 
paste and it should go that way
oh<00:02:13.560> yeah<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.790> rotate<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.420> 90<00:02:15.660> degrees<00:02:15.690> if

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
oh yeah if you rotate it 90 degrees if

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320 
oh yeah if you rotate it 90 degrees if
you<00:02:16.440> take<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> copy<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.940> rotate

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
you take this you copy it and you rotate

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.600 
you take this you copy it and you rotate
it<00:02:18.420> 90<00:02:18.630> degrees<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:19.530> rotates<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.160> 90<00:02:20.400> degrees

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
it 90 degrees it rotates to 90 degrees

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.520 
it 90 degrees it rotates to 90 degrees
but<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.330> type<00:02:21.480> rotate<00:02:21.870> 90<00:02:22.050> degrees<00:02:22.080> again

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
but if you type rotate 90 degrees again

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.830 
but if you type rotate 90 degrees again
then<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> does<00:02:23.520> 180<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> type<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.660> 90

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
then it does 180 and if you type it 90

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.670 
then it does 180 and if you type it 90
degrees<00:02:24.870> again<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.830> goes<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> 260<00:02:27.680> that's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
degrees again then it goes to 260 that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.430 
degrees again then it goes to 260 that's
not<00:02:28.830> 260<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> eat<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.440> it'll

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
not 260 is it I'm going to eat it it'll

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.270 
not 260 is it I'm going to eat it it'll
be<00:02:31.530> 240

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
be 240

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.350 
be 240
