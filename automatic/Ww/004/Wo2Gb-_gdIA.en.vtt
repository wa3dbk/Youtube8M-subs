it to what the texture pack is because

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.760 
it to what the texture pack is because
this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> what's<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> show<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.590> in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this is what's going to show up in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
this is what's going to show up in
minecraft<00:02:05.310> don't<00:02:05.820> leave<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> named<00:02:06.360> archive

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
minecraft don't leave it named archive

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.020 
minecraft don't leave it named archive
because<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.580> confusing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
because it's just going to get confusing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
because it's just going to get confusing
if<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.270> add<00:02:09.420> more<00:02:09.629> than<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
if you add more than one it's going to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
if you add more than one it's going to
be<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.649> archival<00:02:11.099> archive<00:02:11.459> 2<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.599> take

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
be like archival archive 2 so you take

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.820 
be like archival archive 2 so you take
that<00:02:13.200> through

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that through

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.270 
that through
the<00:02:13.920> desktop<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.740> sure<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.190> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the desktop and you make sure to do it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.200 
the desktop and you make sure to do it
this<00:02:17.400> way<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.940> where<00:02:18.090> most

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
this way because this is where most

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.320 
this way because this is where most
people<00:02:18.330> mess<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:20.520> will<00:02:20.820> try

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
people mess up I think is they will try

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.270 
people mess up I think is they will try
and<00:02:21.360> right-click<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.380> compress<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and right-click and compress just the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.540 
and right-click and compress just the
folder<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.390> can't<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.140> because

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
folder and you can't do that because

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.460 
folder and you can't do that because
that<00:02:26.550> will<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.880> compress<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.900> folder<00:02:28.290> not

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
that will just compress the folder not

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.560 
that will just compress the folder not
the<00:02:28.650> contents<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.460> inside<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.270> do

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the contents of it inside so don't do

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.960 
the contents of it inside so don't do
that<00:02:31.190> well<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.610> throw<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.910> the
