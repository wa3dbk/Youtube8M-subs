00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.060
 two 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.230
 3 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.940
 do not 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.539
 hello friends when I was little then like 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.239
 we did not have my playstation nintendo nor 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.809
 the video game because usually we 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.949
 we make our own 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.559
 utensils to play with soldiers 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:43.030
 then then bodies with a clamp 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.070
 normal and current because we were doing this 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.130
 small 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.140
 this little gun 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.630
 and well, I was throwing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.070
 I was throwing chopsticks 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:02.010
 and with that we shot the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.680
 dolls and well, I had enough 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.930
 enough power 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.509
 I will explain more or less how it 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.650
 simply builds easily be 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:18.190
 take a clamp we remove this we 're going 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 to use as trigger and then 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.810
 well then in one of the parties 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:33.770
 from the ends we will take a river east what 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:36.140
 we will leave like this as it is and right here 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 we will do 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 a little down 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.270
 with a saw of these that we can 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.180
 easily buy the Chinese with what 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.190
 which is good because this part of the clamp 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.550
 we will mark it like this and this other 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.720
 simply using it already what 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.010
 we have and more or less 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.950
 taking what can be the size of 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.179
 one of a limar file we have 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.500
 practically 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 from here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 up there is to say we will lower 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 All this 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.990
 up to this point 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.780
 right in the middle 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.380
 we will also do 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.380
 here 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.350
 other 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.970
 what would be the canyon 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.500
 and on this other side it is also saying 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.860
 like the clamp then it will go like this 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.860
 Well right from here 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.510
 up to this point 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.220
 as well 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.030
 we will make another cut 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.030
 why 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.480
 practically 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.160
 you enter what is the toothpick that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:28.240
 will be cut by this part 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.470
 to the canyon system 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.550
 I'm going to make the cuts so that 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.520
 see then what is the assembly 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.130
 Well, once we relaxed with the 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.850
 lima I've already told you it's a matter of 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:51.040
 patience and pass the lime like that and then 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.730
 pass the file like this and with the saw 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 we make a small 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.260
 notch here 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.530
 on this side so you can see it and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.850
 then we proceed to the assembly and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:16.350
 well, the initial assembly 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.350
 it would be this is to say we would pass 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.739
 this over here 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.520
 A) Yes 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.770
 for this here then this 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.789
 and we already have what is the trigger 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.819
 assembled and 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:48.169
 simply now, we would have to paste 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.169
 that we can 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.820
 a little tail 

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:09.060
 here on this side simply 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.060
 then we will stick 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.300
 we would let it dry a little bit and what 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.300
 we would reinforce with 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:27.009
 if we have American tape that is more 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:30.100
 strong better than with insulating tape 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.070
 and then we leave it 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:39.370
 but you see that the assembly is simple 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.370
 just throw this back 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.640
 and once signed now is that by not 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.950
 be dry since you can not ride 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.920
 good but good for you to see more or 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.600
 less this is left like this then the assembly 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.390
 is 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.180
 well back lashes 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.110
 head 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.450
 it gets 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:12.340
 the stick in the center trying not to 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:14.230
 exceed the trigger if triggered 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.740
 and this is all quite a game 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.810
 entertaining is not dangerous what yet 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.570
 so you have to avoid pointing to 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.500
 eyes is not dangerous because the power 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:29.740
 that it has although it can be nailed in cloth 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:34.090
 and all that but for faith to bring down 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.800
 Soldiers and go through potatoes and things 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.910
 of those serves 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.180
 and nothing 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.800
 simple game for those in that 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:51.800
 because time did not have a nintendo one 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.800
 playstation to paste viruses
