to sit on we go ahead and begin the
installation<00:00:31.859> process<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.630> clips

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
installation process we have two clips

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
installation process we have two clips
and<00:00:34.489> alignment<00:00:35.489> pins<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> line<00:00:36.270> up

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and alignment pins we need to line up

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.900 
and alignment pins we need to line up
first<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.860> almost<00:00:38.040> an<00:00:38.340> industry

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
first now it's almost an industry

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
first now it's almost an industry
standard<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.690> knee<00:00:40.290> blocker<00:00:40.559> cover<00:00:40.890> plates

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
standard on knee blocker cover plates

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
standard on knee blocker cover plates
I've<00:00:41.370> never<00:00:41.520> seen<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.300> differently

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I've never seen one go on differently

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
I've never seen one go on differently
than<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.350> it'll<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.860> clips<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> top

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
than this it'll have clips on the top

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
than this it'll have clips on the top
and<00:00:45.090> bolts<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> bottom<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.039> want

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and bolts on the bottom so you can want

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
and bolts on the bottom so you can want
to<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.280> ahead<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> line<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.059> clips<00:00:48.420> first

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to go ahead and line up your clips first

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.689 
to go ahead and line up your clips first
and<00:00:50.390> push<00:00:51.390> them<00:00:51.510> whole<00:00:52.160> just<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.610> you

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and push them whole just like so as you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.950 
and push them whole just like so as you
can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.300> holds<00:00:54.629> itself

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
can see it pretty much holds itself

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
can see it pretty much holds itself
there<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.190> ahead<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there from here you can go ahead and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
there from here you can go ahead and
begin<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.940> mounting<00:00:57.360> procedure<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.590> have

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
begin the mounting procedure so we have

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
begin the mounting procedure so we have
four<00:00:58.949> bolts<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> deal<00:00:59.489> with<00:01:02.180> they're<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
four bolts to deal with they're going to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.980 
four bolts to deal with they're going to
be<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> seven<00:01:04.260> millimeter<00:01:04.939> on<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.750> particular

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
be a seven millimeter on this particular

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.700 
be a seven millimeter on this particular
vehicle<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.139 

now<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:16.829> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.039> start<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.670> before

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
now we're going to start them all before

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.239 
now we're going to start them all before
tightening<00:01:18.810> any<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.319> down<00:01:19.499> we<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.069> one
