00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
kicked even if you recognize the sound

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.050 
kicked even if you recognize the sound
the<00:04:46.830> animation<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.580> can<00:04:47.699> still<00:04:47.879> miss<00:04:48.030> it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
the animation it you can still miss it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.439 
the animation it you can still miss it
when<00:04:48.270> there's<00:04:48.389> a<00:04:48.449> lot<00:04:48.599> going<00:04:48.629> on<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:48.960> threes<00:04:50.449> so

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
when there's a lot going on in threes so

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.610 
when there's a lot going on in threes so
let's<00:04:51.629> really<00:04:51.810> get<00:04:51.930> out<00:04:52.050> no<00:04:52.289> reason<00:04:52.500> not<00:04:52.560> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
let's really get out no reason not to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.300 
let's really get out no reason not to
have<00:04:52.680> that

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.860 

and<00:04:59.310> that's<00:04:59.820> pretty<00:05:00.000> much<00:05:00.120> all<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> addons<00:05:00.600> i

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and that's pretty much all the addons i

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.800 
and that's pretty much all the addons i
use<00:05:01.640> you<00:05:02.640> don't<00:05:02.760> really<00:05:02.850> need<00:05:03.030> much<00:05:03.270> of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
use you don't really need much of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.480 
use you don't really need much of
anything<00:05:04.260> else<00:05:04.560> if<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.100> have<00:05:05.220> too<00:05:05.370> many

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
anything else if you have too many

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.980 
anything else if you have too many
add-ons<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.000> end<00:05:06.150> up<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.360> focusing<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:06.870> the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
add-ons you end up just focusing on the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.360 
add-ons you end up just focusing on the
screen<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:10.380> will<00:05:10.500> distract<00:05:11.040> from<00:05:11.220> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
screen and that will distract from the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.530 
screen and that will distract from the
game<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.850> need<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.090> pay<00:05:12.150> attention<00:05:12.180> to

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
game so you need to pay attention to

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.580 
game so you need to pay attention to
what's<00:05:12.660> going<00:05:12.720> on<00:05:12.870> around<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.560> not<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.280> I

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
what's going on around you and not you I

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.690 
what's going on around you and not you I
but<00:05:16.590> none<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:16.860> these<00:05:16.950> are<00:05:17.070> mandatory<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.640> you

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
but none of these are mandatory so you

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.950 
but none of these are mandatory so you
play<00:05:17.850> without<00:05:17.970> any<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.450> them<00:05:18.570> what<00:05:18.930> i
