00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.490
 [Music] 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 hi to all and pitt in this video I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 wanted to talk to you about the scale report 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 we can meet when we draw 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.630
 a character or several characters 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 in a landscape 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 so if I trace my line of vision is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.680
 a character and I wonder if 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.200
 for example in perspective two 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 characters have the same size so for 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.710
 compare the size of these two 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.690
 characters I will have to trace a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 line of flight even has two lines of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 leak that converge towards the same point 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.199
 of leakage on the line of vision so 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.359
 remind you that the line of sight 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.539
 it's the height of the eye of 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.649
 the observer so here I trace a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 first line of flight that corresponds 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 at the foot and there a second line of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.239
 leak that normally converge towards the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.510
 same good point there is not quite 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.760
 the case 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.089
 so that means that the character 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.190
 duo is a bit too big by 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:11.010
 relation to the character I see at 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.540
 foreground I can do 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.960
 exactly the same with other points 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.850
 leak 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 there for example I go directly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.030
 trace a foot-leakage mailing to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.310
 the head 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 and here I can tell myself that the size of the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.600
 character we find this same size 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 all the way 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 so here for example we can say that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.190
 it is the character in the second plan 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.400
 the same size as the foreground 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.090
 so here's the little tip for 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.240
 represent the characters of the same 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240
 cut 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 we can also help ourselves 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 technique to compare the size of a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
 character with another element of the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 landscape like for example a house or 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280
 a tree 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.250
 so here I will try to compare with 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.100
 the same technique the door 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 of a house with the first character 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.070
 that I drew at the beginning so here I 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.020
 am trying to draw a house 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.350
 completely basic at two points 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.670
 flight 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.140
 so the second vanishing point and at 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.610
 right we do not see it comes out of the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.610
 leaf so I'm going to make a roof 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.610
 basic 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.269
 I will draw a door quickly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.849
 input and I'm going to compare the size 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.890
 in height of this entrance door by 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.250
 report so to my first character 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.450
 that I drew at the start then there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.599
 your opinion to the eye 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.790
 Do you know if that person 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.560
 could go back into a standing position in 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.900
 this house and we'll check it all 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.000
 immediately we draw a line of flight 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.560
 so I'm going to lengthen a little 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.870
 little my line of vision we trace a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.280
 line of flight at the foot of the house 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:59.129
 to the foot of the character and I 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.209
 will take a vanishing point that 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:06.390
 corresponds to the vanishing line of the feet 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 I will do the same with the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.230
 level of the head and I realize 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.769
 that the head comes pretty much to this 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.519
 height there so there the character can 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.519
 to return to his house 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.130
 here's the head comes pretty much to this 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 level there a member of my training 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.610
 beginning my request and also how 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.930
 compare the size of a character who has 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.840
 feet on the ground and the size of a 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 character who has his feet on a roof 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.150
 so it's exactly the same thing 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 except that I will use for that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.610
 several points of little more leakage 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.510
 creepage 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.080
 so already I bring my character to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.170
 level of the person who is on the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170
 roof 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.330
 so the cc of the pretty much it's not 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.130
 mathematical but I always use the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.250
 vanishing points 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.290
 I go to the vertical of this character 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.490
 and then I will help me from the point of 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.960
 leak from home from vanishing point to 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:18.769
 right there to find out exactly 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:22.070
 how high he has so there I have to my 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.080
 pencil and a little big so I traced to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.260
 about the height but the height of the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.890
 character will be pretty much this one so 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.160
 this character there we have it we projected 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.730
 several times one two three times 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.810
 four times even with the roof so we have 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.500
 used at least two to three points 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.190
 of escape to get to our ends so 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.750
 to summarize when we have a character and 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.810
 we want to place it in the space where 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.120
 whether it is using a vanishing point 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.260
 on the line of sight a first point 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.740
 for a first projection 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:10.040
 so here I have my first character 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:11.570
 projected for example here i'm going to do 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.620
 a second projection this time in 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.600
 using a vanishing point towards the 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:22.270
 left no second own character 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.270
 projected here 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.970
 this character if he is high up by 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.280
 example on a roof and I just at the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.060
 project vertically it will have exactly 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.770
 the same size in vertical and if that 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.660
 last character I would like it 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.880
 project on the surface of a building 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.610
 for example I will use the points of 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.509
 following the building simply 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.800
 so you saw there is absolutely 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.800
 nothing complicated
