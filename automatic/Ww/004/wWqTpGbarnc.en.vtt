that there's a lot of tombstone that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.440

from<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.920> defensive<00:01:04.920> structures<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.850> will

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
from the defensive structures that will

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
from the defensive structures that will
defend<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> barbarian<00:01:07.229> king<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.310> that

case I can actually focus on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.910 
case I can actually focus on the

short-range are barbarians and use these

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
short-range are barbarians and use these
arches<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.710> supporting<00:01:23.159> fire<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.210> long

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

arches as supporting fire in a long
range<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> after<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.150> Barbican<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> being

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
range and after the Barbican is being

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.859 
range and after the Barbican is being
defeated<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.610> decided<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.820> attack<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
defeated I'm decided to attack on the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
defeated I'm decided to attack on the
top<00:01:31.079> left<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.340> strategy<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.119> very

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
top left side the strategy is very

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.170 
top left side the strategy is very
simple<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.350> notice<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.579> troops<00:01:35.909> are

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
simple as you notice all your troops are

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
simple as you notice all your troops are
being<00:01:36.509> attracted<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.890> buildings<00:01:38.340> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
being attracted to the buildings they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.870 
being attracted to the buildings they
are<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.759> within<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> walls<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.700> war

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
are not within the walls so if the war

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
are not within the walls so if the war
is<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.090> broken<00:01:42.390> you'll<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> sites

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is not broken you'll go to the sites

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
is not broken you'll go to the sites
right<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.579> deploy<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.299> your<00:01:45.689> troops

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
right so do not deploy all your troops

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.670 
right so do not deploy all your troops
or<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.950> once<00:01:47.250> deploy<00:01:48.060> half<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
or at once deploy half of it so that you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
or at once deploy half of it so that you
can<00:01:49.860> treat<00:01:50.009> clear<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.610> least<00:01:50.990> that's<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can treat clear at least that's the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
can treat clear at least that's the
exterior<00:01:52.680> buildings<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.430> least<00:01:53.640> half<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
exterior buildings at least half of the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
exterior buildings at least half of the
exterior<00:01:55.140> buildings<00:01:55.759> before<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.060> deploy

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
exterior buildings before you deploy

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.499 
exterior buildings before you deploy
anymore<00:01:58.049> add<00:01:58.290> additional<00:01:58.860> troops<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> just

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
anymore add additional troops so I just

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
anymore add additional troops so I just
wasted<00:02:00.899> two<00:02:01.110> operators<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> test<00:02:02.130> whether<00:02:02.280> if

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
wasted two operators to test whether if

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.649 
wasted two operators to test whether if
this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> SD<00:02:04.649> real<00:02:04.890> long<00:02:05.640> war<00:02:05.969> spies<00:02:06.299> haha

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
this is a SD real long war spies haha

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
this is a SD real long war spies haha
wide<00:02:07.259> enough<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> drop<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.879> war

occurs<00:02:09.450> by<00:02:09.660> apparently<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.679> wall<00:02:11.129> breakers

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.290 
occurs by apparently the wall breakers
are<00:02:11.580> not

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
are not

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.810 
are not
is<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.290> attracted<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> spine<00:02:14.250> so

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
is actually attracted to the spine so

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.490 
is actually attracted to the spine so
after<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.420> drop<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> truth<00:02:16.080> right<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
after that you drop the truth right you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500 
after that you drop the truth right you
notice<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.240> wall<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
notice they actually go to the wall and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.050 
notice they actually go to the wall and
you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.080> start<00:02:19.350> using<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:20.100> rage<00:02:20.610> spells

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you can start using your rage spells

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.090 
you can start using your rage spells
rage<00:02:21.810> spells<00:02:22.080> will<00:02:22.380> give<00:02:22.560> them<00:02:22.770> additional

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
rage spells will give them additional

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.060 
rage spells will give them additional
boost<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.150> their<00:02:24.360> damage<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.710> can't<00:02:25.950> you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
boost to their damage so they can't you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.070 
boost to their damage so they can't you
break<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.490> wall<00:02:26.700> much<00:02:26.940> more<00:02:27.210> easier<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
break the wall much more easier and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830 
break the wall much more easier and
after<00:02:28.740> breaking<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> walls<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.910> simply

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
after breaking the walls you can simply

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.320 
after breaking the walls you can simply
just<00:02:31.020> drop<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:31.970> couplings<00:02:32.970> your

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
just drop in all your couplings your

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.960 
just drop in all your couplings your
archers<00:02:33.750> your<00:02:34.170> puppy<00:02:34.500> ruins<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:35.340> clear<00:02:35.700> the

archers your puppy ruins to clear the

structures<00:03:16.260> well<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.220> second<00:03:17.610> attack<00:03:17.970> I'm

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
structures well the second attack I'm

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.690 
structures well the second attack I'm
going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.900> very<00:03:19.620> similar<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.400> but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
going to do is very similar to this but

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.990 
going to do is very similar to this but
slightly<00:03:21.450> much<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.500> difficult<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.280> from

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
slightly much more difficult so from

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.770 
slightly much more difficult so from
here<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.720> my<00:03:25.320> iphone<00:03:26.130> account<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.330> I'm

here this is my iphone account and I'm

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.530 
here this is my iphone account and I'm
going<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:27.989> show<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.230> how<00:03:28.770> is<00:03:29.190> done<00:03:29.520> okay<00:03:30.330> this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
going to show you how is done okay this

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.880 
going to show you how is done okay this
is<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> triple-layer<00:03:31.650> bunker<00:03:32.610> design<00:03:33.620> with<00:03:34.620> the

is a triple-layer bunker design with the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.280 
is a triple-layer bunker design with the
similar<00:03:35.340> almost<00:03:36.000> similar<00:03:36.180> kind<00:03:37.140> of

similar almost similar kind of

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.490 
similar almost similar kind of
strategies<00:03:37.770> as<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.520> all<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.500> defensive

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
strategies as you know all the defensive

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.620 
strategies as you know all the defensive
structures<00:03:40.950> if<00:03:41.130> it's<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.489> spread<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.570> the

structures if it's a spread out on the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.560 
structures if it's a spread out on the
size<00:03:43.110> it's<00:03:43.770> not<00:03:43.890> very<00:03:44.310> optimum<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.239> I've

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
size it's not very optimum as I've

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.370 
size it's not very optimum as I've
discussed<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.290> some<00:03:46.680> my<00:03:46.770> life<00:03:47.010> class<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.780> this

come<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.730> attack<00:04:12.209> me<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:13.080> just<00:04:13.200> discovered

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
come to attack me so I just discovered

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.120 
come to attack me so I just discovered
this<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:15.090> angle<00:04:15.600> which<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.989> not<00:04:16.200> well

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
this this angle which is not well

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.340 
this this angle which is not well
defended<00:04:17.669> by<00:04:17.730> any<00:04:18.030> defensive<00:04:18.660> structures<00:04:19.080> and
