another video this is going to be a

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.579 
another video this is going to be a
quick<00:00:03.540> little<00:00:03.720> match<00:00:03.990> it's<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
quick little match it's going to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.499 
quick little match it's going to
demonstrate<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.370> zerg<00:00:05.670> exploit<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
demonstrate a zerg exploit that is

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.870 
demonstrate a zerg exploit that is
present<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:07.080> patch<00:00:07.379> 9<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.950> got<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.580> idea<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
present in patch 9 I got the idea to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.820 
present in patch 9 I got the idea to
make<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.290> hdstarcraft

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
make a video about this from hdstarcraft

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.650 
make a video about this from hdstarcraft
he<00:00:11.400> has<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> movie<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.240> his<00:00:12.420> channel

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
he has a movie like this on his channel

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.289 
he has a movie like this on his channel
so<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.259> give<00:00:13.889> credit<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.219> him<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> idea<00:00:15.120> in

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so I give credit to him for the idea in

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.790 
so I give credit to him for the idea in
making<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.719> video<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.710> doing

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
making this video and we're doing

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700 
making this video and we're doing
essentially<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.760> same<00:00:17.970> thing<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> six

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
essentially the same thing it is a six

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.970 
essentially the same thing it is a six
pool<00:00:19.949> exploit<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.359> do<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.980> we

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
pool exploit but what we do is we

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
pool exploit but what we do is we
produce<00:00:23.250> eggs<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.090> while<00:00:24.900> these<00:00:25.050> eggs<00:00:25.289> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
produce eggs and while these eggs are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
produce eggs and while these eggs are
being<00:00:25.590> made<00:00:25.830> new<00:00:26.220> larvae<00:00:26.609> will<00:00:26.789> come<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
being made new larvae will come out to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
being made new larvae will come out to
replace<00:00:27.480> those<00:00:27.630> eggs<00:00:27.840> obviously<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.740> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
replace those eggs obviously but in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
replace those eggs obviously but in
patch<00:00:29.279> 9<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.060> cancel<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.109> eggs<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> turn

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
patch 9 you can cancel the eggs and turn

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.229 
patch 9 you can cancel the eggs and turn
them<00:00:31.980> back<00:00:32.070> into<00:00:32.130> larvae<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> don't<00:00:33.090> lose

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
them back into larvae and you don't lose

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.780 
them back into larvae and you don't lose
any<00:00:33.480> money<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> put<00:00:34.770> down<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:34.920> six<00:00:35.340> pool<00:00:35.550> once

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
any money so I put down my six pool once

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
any money so I put down my six pool once
i<00:00:35.880> hit<00:00:36.000> 200<00:00:36.480> minerals<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.559> i<00:00:37.590> have

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
i hit 200 minerals and right now i have

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
i hit 200 minerals and right now i have
a<00:00:38.120> four<00:00:39.120> larvae<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> watch<00:00:40.410> when<00:00:40.649> i<00:00:40.680> hit<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a four larvae and watch when i hit a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
a four larvae and watch when i hit a
hundred<00:00:41.160> i'm<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> again<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.719> rid

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
hundred i'm going to do it again get rid

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
hundred i'm going to do it again get rid
of<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> i'm<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> again<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of this i'm going to do this again and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
of this i'm going to do this again and
try<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> five<00:00:46.320> larvae<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.190> produce

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
try to get up to five larvae to produce

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.930 
try to get up to five larvae to produce
five<00:00:47.760> ten<00:00:48.270> legs<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.739> pool<00:00:50.010> comes<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.760> here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
five ten legs when my pool comes so here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
five ten legs when my pool comes so here
we<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.629> eggs<00:00:51.809> producing<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.590> two

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
we go two eggs producing I have two

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.090 
we go two eggs producing I have two
larvae<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.420> once<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.600> hatchery<00:00:55.039> pumps<00:00:56.039> out

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
larvae and once my hatchery pumps out

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
larvae and once my hatchery pumps out
another<00:00:56.460> larvae<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> three<00:00:57.510> larvae

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
another larvae to make it three larvae

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
another larvae to make it three larvae
I'm<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> cancel<00:00:58.410> these<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.640> watch

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I'm going to cancel these two so watch

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
I'm going to cancel these two so watch
for<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> larvae<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.469> can't<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
for that larvae you can't really see it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
for that larvae you can't really see it
but<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> hatchery<00:01:02.640> did<00:01:02.820> pump<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.210> another

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
but the hatchery did pump out another

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
but the hatchery did pump out another
larvae<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.260> cancelled<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.710> eggs<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> now<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
larvae I cancelled my eggs and now I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.719 
larvae I cancelled my eggs and now I
have<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.270> larvae<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> three<00:01:07.590> eggs<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.610> now

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
have two larvae and three eggs so now

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
have two larvae and three eggs so now
I'm<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.210> again<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.990> three<00:01:10.260> eggs

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I'm going to do it again make three eggs

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.429 
I'm going to do it again make three eggs
and<00:01:10.830> try<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> three<00:01:12.360> larvae<00:01:12.720> but

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and try to get up to three larvae but

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
and try to get up to three larvae but
you'll<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.010> spawning<00:01:14.310> pool<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> complete

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you'll see my spawning pool is complete

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
you'll see my spawning pool is complete
and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.360> didn't<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> risk<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and I didn't really want to risk it so I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.440 
and I didn't really want to risk it so I
just<00:01:16.979> canceled<00:01:17.340> those<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
just canceled those are all of them and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 
just canceled those are all of them and
I'm<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.920> ten<00:01:20.130> legs<00:01:20.310> right

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I'm good with the just ten legs right

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
I'm good with the just ten legs right
now<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> am<00:01:21.570> pumping<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.020> ten<00:01:22.320> links<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
now so I am pumping out ten links at the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.969 
now so I am pumping out ten links at the
speed<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.700> six<00:01:24.090> pool<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.590> crazy

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
speed of a six pool that is just crazy

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
speed of a six pool that is just crazy
the<00:01:26.700> only<00:01:27.090> race<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.299> has<00:01:27.659> any<00:01:27.930> chance<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the only race that has any chance of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140 
the only race that has any chance of
defending<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> Terran<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:29.970> can

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
defending it is Terran because they can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
defending it is Terran because they can
do<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.360> early<00:01:30.600> wall<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> sure<00:01:31.680> Protoss<00:01:32.189> kanwal

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
do an early wall up sure Protoss kanwal
