00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
straightforward and simple job not a lot

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.510 
straightforward and simple job not a lot
really<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:27.460> know<00:00:27.580> to<00:00:27.850> do<00:00:28.000> in<00:00:28.180> this<00:00:28.360> one<00:00:29.520> first

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
really you know to do in this one first

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.729 
really you know to do in this one first
thing<00:00:30.730> first<00:00:31.600> thing<00:00:31.750> I'm<00:00:32.020> going<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.320> do<00:00:32.500> is

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
thing first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.790 
thing first thing I'm going to do is
locate<00:00:33.730> where<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.629> screws<00:00:34.960> are<00:00:35.199> to<00:00:35.440> remove

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
locate where the screws are to remove

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.700 
locate where the screws are to remove
the<00:00:36.039> taillight<00:00:36.519> itself<00:00:36.999> and<00:00:37.569> there's<00:00:38.440> one

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
the taillight itself and there's one

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.169 
the taillight itself and there's one
right<00:00:39.219> in<00:00:39.280> here<00:00:39.699> and<00:00:39.879> another<00:00:40.479> one<00:00:40.600> down<00:00:42.179> right

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
right in here and another one down right

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.639 
right in here and another one down right
about<00:00:43.389> here<00:00:44.879> now<00:00:45.879> of<00:00:46.149> course<00:00:46.359> on<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.870> older<00:00:47.229> GM

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
about here now of course on the older GM

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.680 
about here now of course on the older GM
and<00:00:47.859> Chevy's<00:00:48.190> there<00:00:48.460> used<00:00:48.639> to<00:00:48.729> be<00:00:48.819> screws<00:00:49.269> that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
and Chevy's there used to be screws that

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.009 
and Chevy's there used to be screws that
went<00:00:49.960> in<00:00:50.139> kind<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:50.949> on<00:00:51.069> the<00:00:51.219> sides<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:52.019> now

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
went in kind of on the sides and now

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.430 
went in kind of on the sides and now
they've<00:00:53.289> kind<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:54.030> eliminated<00:00:55.030> them<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:56.289> I'm

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
they've kind of eliminated them now I'm

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.779 
they've kind of eliminated them now I'm
going<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.769> assume<00:00:57.010> there's<00:00:57.339> probably<00:00:57.609> little

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
going to assume there's probably little

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.649 
going to assume there's probably little
plastic<00:00:58.539> clip<00:00:59.289> you<00:00:59.409> thing<00:00:59.620> use<00:00:59.769> in<00:00:59.920> there<00:01:00.659> so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
plastic clip you thing use in there so

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.100 
plastic clip you thing use in there so
when<00:01:02.289> we<00:01:02.729> so<00:01:03.729> when<00:01:03.940> we<00:01:04.089> remove<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.690> taillight

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
when we so when we remove the taillight

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.100 
when we so when we remove the taillight
we'll<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:06.130> careful<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.720> yeah<00:01:07.930> guys

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
we'll have to be careful so yeah guys

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
we'll have to be careful so yeah guys
let's<00:01:08.920> grab<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.160> screwdriver<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.970> get<00:01:10.090> out<00:01:10.210> her

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.150 

then<00:01:22.360> we'll<00:01:22.600> remove<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:23.200> bottom<00:01:24.040> screw<00:01:26.160> and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
then we'll remove the bottom screw and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.570 
then we'll remove the bottom screw and
set<00:01:27.640> them<00:01:27.760> aside<00:01:28.980> now<00:01:29.980> this<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.340> where<00:01:30.520> it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
set them aside now this is where it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.150 
set them aside now this is where it
would<00:01:30.640> help<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.940> have<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.480> magnetic

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
would help to have a magnetic

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540 
would help to have a magnetic
screwdriver<00:01:33.870> but<00:01:34.870> unfortunately<00:01:35.740> these<00:01:36.310> ones

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
screwdriver but unfortunately these ones

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.890 
screwdriver but unfortunately these ones
here<00:01:36.760> aren't<00:01:37.150> magnetic<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.390> if<00:01:40.480> we<00:01:40.570> just<00:01:40.720> give

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
here aren't magnetic so if we just give

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.040 
here aren't magnetic so if we just give
her<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.110> few<00:01:41.410> little<00:01:41.560> flicks<00:01:42.060> does<00:01:43.060> drop<00:01:43.780> out<00:01:44.020> of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
her a few little flicks does drop out of

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.560 
her a few little flicks does drop out of
a<00:01:44.200> hole<00:01:44.410> be<00:01:45.250> careful<00:01:45.670> not<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.880> drop<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.420> in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
a hole be careful not to drop it in

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
a hole be careful not to drop it in
gravel<00:01:47.020> or<00:01:47.260> whatever

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
gravel or whatever

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.440 
gravel or whatever
you<00:01:49.060> know<00:01:49.180> lose<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:51.580> careful<00:01:51.970> not<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.150> lose

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
you know lose it be careful not to lose

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.480 
you know lose it be careful not to lose
the<00:01:52.660> screw<00:01:52.900> as<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:54.040> know<00:01:54.130> they're<00:01:54.310> probably

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
the screw as you know they're probably

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.780 
the screw as you know they're probably
hard<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:56.200> know<00:01:56.320> match<00:01:56.830> at<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> hardware

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
hard to you know match at the hardware

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.730 
hard to you know match at the hardware
store<00:02:00.720> didn't<00:02:01.720> get<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.960> taillight<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.410> bit<00:02:02.650> of

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
store didn't get the taillight a bit of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:14.210 
store didn't get the taillight a bit of
a<00:02:02.830> wiggle

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.100 

well<00:02:15.220> guys<00:02:15.460> upon<00:02:15.880> further<00:02:16.150> inspection<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
well guys upon further inspection I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.930 
well guys upon further inspection I
actually<00:02:17.290> found<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.280> tricky<00:02:18.700> way<00:02:18.820> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
actually found a little tricky way of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.380 
actually found a little tricky way of
getting<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.330> out<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.520> basically<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.210> don't

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
getting it out so basically you don't

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.290 
getting it out so basically you don't
really<00:02:22.540> have<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.170> prying<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.920> at<00:02:24.010> all

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
really have to be prying on it at all

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.320 
really have to be prying on it at all
because<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.160> plastic<00:02:27.370> clip<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:28.060> go

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
because the little plastic clip is go

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.570 
because the little plastic clip is go
into<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.810> box<00:02:28.990> panel<00:02:29.530> at<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.650> truck<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
into the box panel at the truck on the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.300 
into the box panel at the truck on the
outside<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.330> left<00:02:31.540> there<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:33.070> course

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
outside of the left there and of course

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.940 
outside of the left there and of course
the<00:02:33.520> screws<00:02:33.850> hold<00:02:34.270> detail<00:02:34.810> light<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.650> tin

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the screws hold detail light to the tin

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.270 
the screws hold detail light to the tin
on<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.580> inside<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.350> course<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:38.920> GM

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
on the inside now of course like GM

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.100 
on the inside now of course like GM
designers<00:02:39.850> they<00:02:40.000> always<00:02:40.270> figure<00:02:40.630> some<00:02:40.870> weird

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
designers they always figure some weird

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.180 
designers they always figure some weird
way<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.290> hold<00:02:41.590> things<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:47.070> there's<00:02:48.070> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
way to hold things in so there's a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.030 
way to hold things in so there's a
little<00:02:48.490> indent<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> gotta<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.650> gently

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
little indent so you gotta just gently

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.750 
little indent so you gotta just gently
pull<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.490> out<00:02:52.470> until<00:02:53.470> we're<00:02:53.680> at<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.860> side<00:02:54.100> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
pull it out until we're at the side and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.229 
pull it out until we're at the side and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.820 

it<00:04:36.340> kind<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.729> tends<00:04:36.969> to<00:04:37.180> make<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.509> wonder<00:04:37.719> if<00:04:38.080> I

may have a blow in fuse and there was

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.869 
may have a blow in fuse and there was
actually<00:04:41.050> nothing<00:04:41.199> wrong<00:04:41.520> with<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.699> right

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
actually nothing wrong with the right

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.409 
actually nothing wrong with the right
side<00:04:43.210> brake<00:04:43.870> light<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> we'll<00:04:45.789> install<00:04:46.180> this

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
side brake light so we'll install this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
new bulb and see if she lights up and

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.159 
new bulb and see if she lights up and
yeah<00:04:50.259> there<00:04:50.620> she<00:04:50.800> goes<00:04:50.979> she's<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:52.419> she<00:04:52.479> was<00:04:52.840> was

yeah there she goes she's so she was was
and<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:55.330> know<00:04:55.449> a<00:04:55.770> bulb<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.009> was<00:04:57.189> no<00:04:57.340> good<00:04:58.319> now

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
and you know a bulb that was no good now

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.499 
and you know a bulb that was no good now
the<00:04:59.379> most<00:04:59.680> common<00:05:00.159> thing<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.550> go<00:05:00.699> on<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.090> truck

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
the most common thing to go on a truck

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.219 
the most common thing to go on a truck
is<00:05:01.870> either<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.409> bulb<00:05:02.650> or<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.280> fuse<00:05:03.610> on<00:05:04.270> older

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
is either the bulb or the fuse on older

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.260 
is either the bulb or the fuse on older
vehicles<00:05:05.710> or<00:05:06.069> so<00:05:06.280> sometimes<00:05:06.849> you<00:05:06.969> do<00:05:07.090> get

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.480 
vehicles or so sometimes you do get
broken<00:05:07.569> wires<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.379> in<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:08.860> case<00:05:09.129> you

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490
