00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the pass rush Otis Wilson was the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.380 
the pass rush Otis Wilson was the
outside<00:02:13.810> guy<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.140> tackle<00:02:14.860> looked<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.430> Ron

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
outside guy the tackle looked in Ron

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.510 
outside guy the tackle looked in Ron
Heller<00:02:16.750> then<00:02:17.170> he<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.500> let<00:02:17.680> Wilson<00:02:17.950> run<00:02:18.340> right

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
Heller then he just let Wilson run right

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.040 
Heller then he just let Wilson run right
by<00:02:18.730> him<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.090> think<00:02:19.270> maybe<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.690> numbers

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
by him I think maybe the numbers

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.500 
by him I think maybe the numbers
confused<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.740> well<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.640> always<00:02:21.880> do<00:02:22.330> that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
confused it well they always do that

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020 
confused it well they always do that
every<00:02:23.350> third<00:02:23.650> down<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.190> year<00:02:24.430> Otis<00:02:24.760> Wilson

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
every third down this year Otis Wilson

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.820 
every third down this year Otis Wilson
becomes<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.690> defensive<00:02:26.320> lineman

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.979 

the<00:02:29.830> burden<00:02:30.370> would<00:02:31.270> appear<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.570> be<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.810> little

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
the burden would appear to be a little

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.170 
the burden would appear to be a little
angry
