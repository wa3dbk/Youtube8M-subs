00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 But it 's today we're talking to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.340
 you about obesity we bring a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.099
 news in all this is that it is the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 role of the brain with the brain can 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.900
 make a difference and help us see if 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.720
 this barrier to balance fat 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 this whole question is the doctor here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.930
 Álvaro is showing us helping us to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 to know is it seems that you can do all 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 difference but I wanted to understand 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.649
 it's still there, the next is how I went 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 decision making, people have 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.399
 to have a can-making is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.510
 showed here is not is not photoshop nor 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 refrigerator, you lost 105 pounds 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 you've told us the story does not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 can be from the outside in has to be 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.079
 from the inside out and is from the inside 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.820
 out will make sense of the history of the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.010
 brain is given of how it helps us to 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 avc the issue of obesity 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.970
 and how was it for you what did you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 Drives went by the douro was for the love 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.189
 it was not really my struggle with the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.159
 balance she was constant 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.890
 I always had this desire to lose 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.689
 I've always had this weight. 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 inconstancy and in this last phase now 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 I lost weight I was having 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 difficulty in joining a 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.280
 to feed a real treatment to the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 lose weight 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.090
 by the number of times it had already 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 recovered everything again as 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 restrictive diet exaggerated absurd 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 then I lost after recovering all of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.159
 new was then discouraged from doing 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.280
 because he was already sure that getting fat 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.799
 new but that sector in an idea I 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.780
 I said I need to change my 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.920
 way of living from feeding me to the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 rest of my life 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.189
 Let's do something that is not to 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.360
 long term but that is forever and 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.119
 this question of being here today in this 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.950
 talking about obesity 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.410
 brain for me 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.849
 is essential because the issue 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 It's all here in the head. 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.709
 the food is a pretext is one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.140
 important because you are talking about a 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.890
 of a problem that he is consequent of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.300
 a bad diet more bad 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 food 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.510
 it happens by a choice that is made 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.769
 and this choice happens here in the brain 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.250
 So is this decision like the doctor 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:52.410
 said that it is very important to focus on 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.110
 geek always talks and you learn to 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 talk to yourself you learn to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.829
 do not sabotage yourself not to make excuses 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.690
 to eat what you should not 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.420
 I think she 's putting things there. 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.640
 who are so completely common 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.709
 of the people who end up 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.239
 facing the problem of overweight and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.010
 obesity right 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.109
 one is this history of the accordion effect 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.109
 you get the cool result but 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.209
 little by little you lose everything, and you're 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.489
 impressive because really when 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.790
 you start working on this issue of 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.430
 weight to resume eating already with 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.650
 sugar question fries these foods 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.870
 that do not do health good 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.290
 quickly she takes off she changes the landing 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.170
 It's not easy for you to gain weight and then 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.889
 consensus is a consensus. 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.670
 with there is only one mind working 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.329
 cool 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.060
 if what you have is not as cool 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.700
 brain is malfunctioning and you have 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.849
 a good mind or your subject a 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.060
 behavior is appropriate then what 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.739
 happened to him showed him photo 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.410
 was fully informed of the 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.099
 it was not totally in fact 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.480
 to make a decision and 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.000
 left to deflate his body dna 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.400
 there are excellent 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.860
 medicines that deflate the body 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.960
 but how will you say form the body you 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.960
 it is deflating 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.090
 I send the brain now when there is no 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.370
 medicines I'm talking about 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.710
 specific medicines is for 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.370
 to lose weight, I 'm talking about 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.009
 specific medicines to treat 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.919
 causes that are making run for 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.470
 example to treat impulsiveness 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:50.780
 impulsivity may be per drug can 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:54.830
 being eaten can be by algae and co 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.520
 the alcohol the cigarette is for food 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.620
 prohibited by game or by all options 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.320
 then the person has a 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.229
 uncontrollable impulsivity when 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.620
 some region of her brain does not 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.740
 can stop feelings and emotions 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.509
 then there is a biochemical fault exists 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.820
 a failure in hormones 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.060
 as I deflate with a good 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.940
 feeding and physical activity 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.370
 cpf training 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.889
 my body I'm going to deflate my 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.650
 brain is the extent to which my 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.750
 brain I can get better 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.740
 best strategies behaviors 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.020
 better feelings better decisions and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.330
 I can continue the process 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.639
 chronic that is to lose weight 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.310
 now what is the normal thinking 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.520
 who has cpf a defect that is a 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.050
 magic thing that is an immediate thing is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.759
 something that has no discipline 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.789
 commitment is that it is not 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.680
 persistence that can make exceptions 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.340
 all the time then the problem is here 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.340
 heavenly
