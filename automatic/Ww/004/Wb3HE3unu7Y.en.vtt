00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and fits in so i think that is such a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470 
and fits in so i think that is such a
good<00:00:58.160> christmas<00:00:59.160> market<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> oven

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
good christmas market more like the oven

good christmas market more like the oven
the<00:01:01.050> ones<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.440> took<00:01:01.770> home<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.250> manchester

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the ones we took home from manchester

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
the ones we took home from manchester
several<00:01:03.180> times<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.140> crap<00:01:04.409> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
several times a really crap in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.760 
several times a really crap in
comparison<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> nice

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
comparison and so I think that's a nice

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
comparison and so I think that's a nice
souvenir<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.549> stuff<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:10.140> home

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
