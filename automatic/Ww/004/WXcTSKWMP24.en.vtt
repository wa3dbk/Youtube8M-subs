gigahertz<00:00:34.920> atom<00:00:35.489> processor<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
gigahertz atom processor this one I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.610 
gigahertz atom processor this one I
think<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:46.460> half<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.640> gig<00:00:47.820> ram<00:00:48.059> kirshen<00:00:49.190> with

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
think is the half a gig ram kirshen with

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:13.270 
think is the half a gig ram kirshen with
SSD<00:00:52.620> storage

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.140 

so<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.550> size<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.660> there<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:18.170> case

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.490 

the<00:01:24.150> network<00:01:24.510> so<00:01:26.780> underneath<00:01:27.780> you've<00:01:28.410> got

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the network so underneath you've got

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:43.910 
the network so underneath you've got
power<00:01:31.500> adapter<00:01:35.780> pretty<00:01:36.780> small<00:01:42.410> cover<00:01:43.410> edv

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
power adapter pretty small cover edv

these<00:01:45.350> manuals

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.070 

and<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.520> smaller<00:02:00.790> 3-cell<00:02:01.360> battery

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.810 

that's<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.290> box<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.520> netbook<00:02:09.790> itself

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
that's it box so the netbook itself

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.630 
that's it box so the netbook itself
obviously<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.300> one<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.640> on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
obviously this is the right one and on

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.740 
obviously this is the right one and on
the<00:02:15.820> sides<00:02:16.030> we've<00:02:16.300> got<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:17.280> card<00:02:18.280> reader

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the sides we've got a card reader
