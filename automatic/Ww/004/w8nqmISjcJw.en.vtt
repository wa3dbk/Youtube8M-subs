00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
of paper and fold down so there is a

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:32.189 
of paper and fold down so there is a
rectangle<00:00:25.179> rectangular<00:00:26.189> piece<00:00:28.079> of<00:00:29.079> paper<00:00:31.199> at

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
rectangle rectangular piece of paper at
