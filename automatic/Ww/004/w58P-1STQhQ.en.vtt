00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.389
 hi the other was going to do for you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.090
 white chocolate pavÃ© recipe and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 bitter chocolate, preferring to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.949
 can make chocolate white chocolate 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 white chocolate milk where bitter or 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.939
 I do not know any chocolate you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.310
 prefer and this recipe I made was 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.679
 great for making a great game and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.649
 then on a dam that I wanted 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:31.199
 then two in the breque rbs number 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.140
 2 revenue and with that amount of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.360
 ingredients and 91 86 split in half 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 so to see the virus continue 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
 watching 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.340
 We're going to need two cans of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 condensed milk two cans of milk 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 will use the condensed milk can to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.710
 measure six sifted gems two 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.910
 tablespoons corn starch two 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 milk cream cases 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 these are the ingredients for crime 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.390
 now in a pot we'll put 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.450
 all the ingredients except the cream of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450
 milk 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.120
 Now we're going to mix these 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.870
 ingredients and let's take to the fire 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.530
 leaving low heat stirring constantly until 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.530
 thicken 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.070
 so as you can see it has already thickened 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.750
 and I already hung up the fire 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.289
 now we'll get the cream and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.759
 put in the microwave to heat 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.590
 now that it's already warm we'll go 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:11.819
 pour the sour cream into the other crime 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:13.860
 Let's fiddle well for the cream. 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.980
 we'll need 200 grams of 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.959
 white chocolate and 200 grams of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.090
 half bitter chocolate the two chocolates 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.310
 must be chopped 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.440
 Now I know it's dark, it 's fine. 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 hard to see but I'm just sharing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.599
 the cream in two part then where try 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940
 divide in two equal parts 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.730
 in one of the parties and I will add the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.069
 white chocolate and cream is still 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.579
 hot the chocolate will melt then only 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.140
 I'll stir until the chocolate melts. 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.950
 in the other part I'll do the same thing 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.540
 only the bitter chocolate afterwards 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.010
 that the chocolate already melted I'll go 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.010
 let the two creams cool 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.439
 now we'll need two cups 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 milk mixed with 4 teaspoons 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.879
 soup or of 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.459
 chocolate 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.799
 I chose the dish, we'll need it. 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.799
 also of champagne wafer 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.170
 now to ride the pavement we go 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.170
 dip the biscuits in the milk with the milk 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.520
 and now we're going to make layers 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.790
 then the first layer will be of 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.550
 wafer the next layer of cream 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.580
 any of the two and then another layer 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.290
 wafer and another layer of cream 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.490
 different from the first one you used and is 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.650
 I just understand making layers and the last one. 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.650
 layer has to be cream layer 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.439
 to decorate I grated some chocolate 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.310
 On top if you want you can also 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.310
 use granulate 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.140
 that's all there is to a list hope you guys 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.650
 Did you like it, thank you so much for watching? 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.650
