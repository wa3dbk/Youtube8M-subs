that any point in time one of your

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.190 
that any point in time one of your
teammates<00:03:37.310> quote-unquote<00:03:38.239> can<00:03:38.569> turn<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:39.019> you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
teammates and steal their money the only

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
teammates and steal their money the only
bad<00:03:44.659> thing<00:03:44.689> is<00:03:45.109> that's<00:03:45.379> gonna<00:03:45.590> make<00:03:45.799> it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
bad thing is that's gonna make it

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.259 
bad thing is that's gonna make it
getting<00:03:46.189> through<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> level<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> lot<00:03:46.939> harder

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
getting through the level a lot harder

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.759 
getting through the level a lot harder
because<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.780> don't<00:03:47.959> have<00:03:48.079> as<00:03:48.170> many<00:03:48.260> teammates

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
because you don't have as many teammates

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.699 
because you don't have as many teammates
also<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.329> twist<00:03:50.629> on<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.170> when<00:03:51.500> their

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
also the twist on that is when their

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.520 
also the twist on that is when their
spawn<00:03:52.159> after<00:03:52.609> they<00:03:53.180> die<00:03:53.389> they<00:03:53.870> become<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.230> cop

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
spawn after they die they become a cop

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.520 
spawn after they die they become a cop
so<00:03:54.829> they'll<00:03:54.980> be<00:03:55.099> fighting<00:03:55.340> against<00:03:55.909> you<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
so they'll be fighting against you the
