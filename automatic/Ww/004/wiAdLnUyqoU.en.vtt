00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
wood as you look at the the top of it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
wood as you look at the the top of it
like<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.539> check<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.320> center<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
like this and you check the center the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.029 
like this and you check the center the
center<00:00:47.340> wood<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.450> always<00:00:48.809> crack<00:00:49.140> towards

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
center wood will always crack towards

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.660 
center wood will always crack towards
this<00:00:50.579> Center<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> check<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this Center right here so you check and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
this Center right here so you check and
you<00:00:53.940> look<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> direction<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.260> go

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you look at the direction it's gonna go

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.939 
you look at the direction it's gonna go
so<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.379> way<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
so you see it's going up this way and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.369 
so you see it's going up this way and
this<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> where<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this way this is where the most is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.020 
this way this is where the most is
there's<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.730> tiny

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
there's gonna be all these little tiny

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.190 
there's gonna be all these little tiny
checks<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.619> can't<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

checks you can't really you you have to
dry<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> wood<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.400> slowly<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.570> order

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
dry the wood out really slowly in order

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.760 
dry the wood out really slowly in order
to<00:01:10.229> avoid<00:01:10.530> these<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.189> checks<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.939> there's

say you carve a bear or an eagle or
something<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.299> intricate<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> face

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
something really intricate in the face

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.029 
something really intricate in the face
is<00:01:30.340> right<00:01:30.670> here<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:32.259> it's<00:01:32.380> right<00:01:32.560> here<00:01:32.829> what's

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
is right here or it's right here what's

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.389 
is right here or it's right here what's
going<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.219> happen<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:35.469> wood<00:01:35.829> will<00:01:36.100> crack

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
going to happen is the wood will crack

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.789 
going to happen is the wood will crack
in<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.729> easiest<00:01:37.090> place<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.570> crack<00:01:38.079> normally

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
in the easiest place to crack normally

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.740 
in the easiest place to crack normally
so<00:01:39.159> if<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.340> put<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.609> face<00:01:42.539> it's<00:01:43.539> on<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
so if you put the face it's on the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.719 
so if you put the face it's on the
closest<00:01:44.229> spot<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.619> if<00:01:44.679> you<00:01:44.770> carve<00:01:45.069> back<00:01:45.429> and

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
closest spot so if you carve back and

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.179 
closest spot so if you carve back and
there's<00:01:45.850> only<00:01:46.000> like<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.450> much<00:01:46.750> wood<00:01:47.189> left

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
there's only like that much wood left

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.090 
there's only like that much wood left
and<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.240> center<00:01:49.539> is<00:01:49.630> right<00:01:49.840> there<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.890> wood

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
and the center is right there the wood

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.039 
and the center is right there the wood
will<00:01:51.280> end<00:01:51.429> up<00:01:51.549> splitting<00:01:52.030> right<00:01:52.719> through

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
will end up splitting right through

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.849 
will end up splitting right through
whatever<00:01:53.319> you<00:01:53.890> carved<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.579> a<00:01:55.569> way<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.170> avoid

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
whatever you carved a a way to avoid

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.850 
whatever you carved a a way to avoid
that<00:01:57.219> is<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.689> let's<00:01:59.469> say<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.689> do<00:02:01.929> carve<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:02.619> and

that is to let's say you do carve it and

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.359 
that is to let's say you do carve it and
your<00:02:03.459> face<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:04.179> right<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.439> let's<00:02:06.189> say

you'd<00:02:16.000> cut<00:02:16.299> from<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.750> center<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
you'd cut from the center and you just

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.069 
you'd cut from the center and you just
cut<00:02:17.980> straight<00:02:18.430> down<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:19.000> entire<00:02:19.329> log<00:02:19.780> and

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
cut straight down the entire log and

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.740 
cut straight down the entire log and
that<00:02:20.260> would<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:21.280> rid<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.730> problem<00:02:22.329> it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that would get rid of that problem it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.630 
that would get rid of that problem it
wouldn't<00:02:22.959> cut<00:02:23.379> split<00:02:23.829> up<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> face<00:02:24.610> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
wouldn't cut split up to the face and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.250 
wouldn't cut split up to the face and
other<00:02:25.000> thing<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.360> can<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.629> go<00:02:25.840> underneath

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
other thing you can do is go underneath

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.259 
other thing you can do is go underneath
and<00:02:26.980> do<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.129> direct<00:02:27.579> cut<00:02:28.019> through<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:30.010> way<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
and do a direct cut through that way the

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.900 
and do a direct cut through that way the
wood<00:02:31.450> won't<00:02:31.660> crack<00:02:31.959> towards<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.440> center

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
wood won't crack towards the center

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.240 
wood won't crack towards the center
another<00:02:33.910> thing<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.420> do<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:35.590> go<00:02:35.859> completely

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
another thing to do just go completely

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.990 
another thing to do just go completely
across<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.090> lop<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.780> log<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.769> half

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
across and lop the log in half

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.670 
across and lop the log in half
following<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.139> whatever<00:02:41.530> you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
following that then you whatever you

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.190 
following that then you whatever you
carve<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.609> in<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.239> side<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.750> won't<00:02:43.959> get<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
carve with in the side it won't get a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.379 
carve with in the side it won't get a
big<00:02:44.470> crack<00:02:44.889> like<00:02:45.190> that'll<00:02:45.639> just<00:02:45.849> get<00:02:46.000> little

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
big crack like that'll just get little

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.099 
big crack like that'll just get little
tiny<00:02:47.260> checks<00:02:47.769> like<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:49.109> through

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
tiny checks like you see all through

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.009 
tiny checks like you see all through
here<00:02:50.470> however<00:02:51.459> there<00:02:51.849> are<00:02:51.910> ways<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.420> make<00:02:52.599> that

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
here however there are ways to make that

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:01.650 
here however there are ways to make that
minimal<00:02:54.269> what<00:02:55.269> else<00:02:57.989> when<00:03:00.120> when<00:03:01.120> looking<00:03:01.510> at

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
minimal what else when when looking at

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.069 
minimal what else when when looking at
the<00:03:02.230> wood<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.700> want<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.060> make<00:03:04.419> sure<00:03:04.450> where<00:03:04.900> did

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
the wood you want to make sure where did

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.370 
the wood you want to make sure where did
you<00:03:05.169> get<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.440> from<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.940> log<00:03:07.419> here<00:03:07.750> was<00:03:08.019> a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
you get it from this log here was a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.659 
you get it from this log here was a
old-growth<00:03:09.130> cedar<00:03:10.120> log<00:03:10.419> so<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:12.310> was

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
old-growth cedar log so and it was

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.400 
old-growth cedar log so and it was
buried<00:03:13.150> underground<00:03:13.419> so<00:03:13.840> what<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:13.989> had<00:03:14.169> to<00:03:14.260> do

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
buried underground so what I had to do

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.020 
buried underground so what I had to do
was<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.709> had<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.889> pressure<00:03:15.130> wash<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.730> log

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
was I had to pressure wash this log

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.440 
was I had to pressure wash this log
first<00:03:16.980> before<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.430> even<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.819> anything<00:03:19.269> with

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
first before I can even do anything with

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.199 
first before I can even do anything with
it<00:03:19.480> because<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.620> dirt<00:03:21.280> dirt<00:03:21.700> will<00:03:21.940> dull

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
it because of the dirt dirt will dull

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.990 
it because of the dirt dirt will dull
your<00:03:22.419> chain<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.739> have<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.190> make<00:03:24.370> sure<00:03:24.400> that

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
your chain so you have to make sure that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.150 
your chain so you have to make sure that
and<00:03:25.739> even<00:03:26.739> trees<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.730> are<00:03:27.849> freshly<00:03:28.269> cut<00:03:28.480> down

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
and even trees that are freshly cut down

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.830 
and even trees that are freshly cut down
depending<00:03:30.160> on<00:03:30.340> where<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.639> person<00:03:30.819> lived<00:03:31.569> or

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
depending on where the person lived or

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.479 
depending on where the person lived or
where<00:03:31.989> your<00:03:32.169> trees<00:03:32.470> came<00:03:32.709> from<00:03:33.040> there<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.459> be

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
where your trees came from there can be

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.610 
where your trees came from there can be
a<00:03:33.760> bunch<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.419> dirt<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.720> mud<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> ground

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
a bunch of dirt and mud on the ground

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.440 
a bunch of dirt and mud on the ground
and<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.069> have<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> clean<00:03:36.579> that<00:03:36.760> off<00:03:36.819> but

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
and you have to clean that off but

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.979 
and you have to clean that off but
bark<00:03:37.629> can<00:03:38.200> dull<00:03:38.440> your<00:03:38.709> chain<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:40.450> types<00:03:40.720> of

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
bark can dull your chain the types of

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.910 
bark can dull your chain the types of
wood<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.830> well<00:03:44.849> like<00:03:45.849> some<00:03:46.209> wood<00:03:46.390> is<00:03:46.510> hot

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
wood as well like some wood is hot

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.000 
wood as well like some wood is hot
softer<00:03:47.920> than<00:03:47.980> others<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:50.140> cedar<00:03:50.500> Cedars

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
softer than others and like cedar Cedars

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.100 
softer than others and like cedar Cedars
a<00:03:51.040> lot<00:03:51.370> softer<00:03:51.670> wood<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.209> work<00:03:52.390> with<00:03:52.660> it's<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
a lot softer wood to work with it's a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.640 
a lot softer wood to work with it's a
lot<00:03:53.260> easier<00:03:54.780> compared<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.870> like<00:03:56.110> let's<00:03:56.410> say

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
lot easier compared to like let's say

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.880 
lot easier compared to like let's say
fur<00:03:57.190> or<00:03:57.760> o<00:03:58.290> or<00:04:00.180> alder<00:04:01.410> once<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.500> start<00:04:02.769> getting

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
fur or o or alder once you start getting

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.470 
fur or o or alder once you start getting
into<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.670> want<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:03.970> use<00:04:04.180> soft<00:04:04.540> woods<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.799> it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
into you want to use soft woods for it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.320 
into you want to use soft woods for it
it's<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.810> lot<00:04:07.959> easier<00:04:08.379> on<00:04:08.410> your<00:04:08.650> chainsaw

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
it's just a lot easier on your chainsaw

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.809 
it's just a lot easier on your chainsaw
if<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:11.110> get<00:04:11.349> like<00:04:11.650> oak<00:04:12.010> or<00:04:12.250> whatever<00:04:12.549> you're

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
if you get like oak or whatever you're

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.339 
if you get like oak or whatever you're
gonna<00:04:12.910> have<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.209> sharpen<00:04:13.450> your<00:04:13.720> chains<00:04:13.959> more

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
gonna have to sharpen your chains more

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.170 
gonna have to sharpen your chains more
you're<00:04:14.709> gonna<00:04:14.799> run<00:04:15.250> through<00:04:15.549> your<00:04:15.700> chains<00:04:15.970> a

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
you're gonna run through your chains a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.400 
you're gonna run through your chains a
lot<00:04:16.359> quicker<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:19.139> yeah

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
lot quicker and yeah

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.020 
lot quicker and yeah
so<00:04:20.769> what<00:04:21.100> else<00:04:21.220> there's<00:04:23.250> when<00:04:24.250> there's

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
so what else there's when there's

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.719 
so what else there's when there's
another<00:04:25.270> thing<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.660> look<00:04:25.840> for<00:04:26.220> which<00:04:27.220> isn't<00:04:27.490> on

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
another thing to look for which isn't on

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.250 
another thing to look for which isn't on
this<00:04:27.940> log<00:04:28.180> wood<00:04:28.360> I'll<00:04:28.479> show<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.960> another

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
this log wood I'll show you on another

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.580 
this log wood I'll show you on another
log<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.729> second<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.389> when<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.260> tree<00:04:32.560> is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
log in a second is when a tree is

log in a second is when a tree is
growing<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:34.660> wind<00:04:34.930> let's<00:04:35.470> say<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> wind

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
growing the wind let's say the wind

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.430 
growing the wind let's say the wind
grabs<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.510> kind<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:37.810> twists<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.350> you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
grabs it and it kind of twists it you

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.700 
grabs it and it kind of twists it you
know<00:04:38.590> trees<00:04:39.280> will<00:04:39.639> kind<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.150> wave<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:40.810> side

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
know trees will kind of wave like side

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.670 
know trees will kind of wave like side
those<00:04:42.340> sway<00:04:42.729> kind<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.300> what<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.990> happen<00:04:44.169> is<00:04:44.530> it

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
those sway kind of what can happen is it

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.129 
those sway kind of what can happen is it
can<00:04:44.710> cause<00:04:45.039> these<00:04:45.400> Center<00:04:45.850> rings<00:04:46.150> here<00:04:46.510> to

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
can cause these Center rings here to

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.060 
can cause these Center rings here to
separate<00:04:47.740> from<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.780> outer<00:04:50.229> ring<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.830> when<00:04:50.950> you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
separate from the outer ring so when you

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.810 
separate from the outer ring so when you
cut<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:53.020> center<00:04:53.440> can<00:04:53.650> pop<00:04:53.919> right<00:04:53.950> out<00:04:54.520> so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
cut and the center can pop right out so

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.520 
cut and the center can pop right out so
you<00:04:54.910> see<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.539> sample<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.080> piece<00:04:56.350> of

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
you see this is a sample of piece of

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.070 
you see this is a sample of piece of
wood<00:04:56.650> where<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:56.919> tree<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.610> was<00:04:57.789> swaying<00:04:58.180> at

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
wood where the tree it was swaying at

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.740 
wood where the tree it was swaying at
one<00:04:59.350> point<00:04:59.650> will<00:05:00.130> multiple<00:05:00.639> points<00:05:01.120> while<00:05:01.450> it

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
one point will multiple points while it

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.170 
one point will multiple points while it
was<00:05:01.960> growing<00:05:02.289> so<00:05:03.039> you<00:05:03.100> see<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.550> part<00:05:03.910> is

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
was growing so you see this part is

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.930 
was growing so you see this part is
separated<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.530> whole<00:05:05.800> piece<00:05:06.160> will<00:05:06.580> pop

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
separated so that whole piece will pop

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.820 
separated so that whole piece will pop
out<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.680> same<00:05:08.680> for<00:05:08.710> right<00:05:09.010> up<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.820> here<00:05:10.830> so

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
out and same for right up in here so

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.409 
out and same for right up in here so
that's<00:05:11.979> another<00:05:12.310> thing<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:12.669> have<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.240> look

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
that's another thing you have to look

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.270 
that's another thing you have to look
for<00:05:13.780> while<00:05:15.210> carving<00:05:16.350> because<00:05:17.350> you<00:05:17.830> can<00:05:18.039> I've

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
for while carving because you can I've

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.430 
for while carving because you can I've
went<00:05:18.880> through<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.419> made<00:05:19.450> stuff<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.260> then

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
went through and made stuff and then

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.950 
went through and made stuff and then
just<00:05:20.470> have<00:05:20.979> this<00:05:21.190> whole<00:05:21.460> piece<00:05:21.910> here<00:05:21.960> pop

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
just have this whole piece here pop

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.460 
just have this whole piece here pop
right<00:05:23.380> out<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:24.550> something<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.360> can<00:05:25.510> do<00:05:25.690> to

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
right out and something you can do to

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.020 
right out and something you can do to
get<00:05:26.620> an<00:05:26.710> idea<00:05:27.039> on<00:05:27.099> how<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.400> wood<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:27.849> gonna

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
get an idea on how the wood is gonna

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.850 
get an idea on how the wood is gonna
crack<00:05:28.680> cut<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:29.860> thin<00:05:30.430> piece<00:05:30.789> off<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:32.590> see<00:05:32.740> it's

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
crack cut a thin piece off you see it's

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.589 
crack cut a thin piece off you see it's
kind<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.220> warped<00:05:33.520> now<00:05:33.729> but<00:05:34.389> cut<00:05:34.660> cut<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.530> about

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
kind of warped now but cut cut it about

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.960 
kind of warped now but cut cut it about
let's<00:05:37.599> say<00:05:37.810> about<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:39.010> thick<00:05:39.400> about<00:05:39.669> maybe

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
let's say about that thick about maybe

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.839 
let's say about that thick about maybe
in<00:05:40.320> half<00:05:41.320> an<00:05:41.530> inch<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.919> an<00:05:42.039> inch<00:05:42.250> thick<00:05:42.639> and

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
in half an inch to an inch thick and

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.930 
in half an inch to an inch thick and
just<00:05:43.479> at<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.690> very<00:05:43.870> top<00:05:44.200> of<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.560> log

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
just at the very top of the log

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.689 
just at the very top of the log
cut<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.570> end<00:05:46.720> off<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.229> then<00:05:47.350> when<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.919> it'll

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
cut the end off and then when it it'll

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.850 
cut the end off and then when it it'll
dry<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:48.970> lot<00:05:49.240> quicker<00:05:49.449> so<00:05:50.350> you'll<00:05:50.530> get<00:05:50.650> an<00:05:50.740> idea

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
dry a lot quicker so you'll get an idea

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.700 
dry a lot quicker so you'll get an idea
on<00:05:51.130> how<00:05:51.250> it<00:05:51.639> will<00:05:52.000> crack<00:05:52.389> so<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.380> piece<00:05:53.560> I

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
on how it will crack so this the piece I

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.780 
on how it will crack so this the piece I
got<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.070> from<00:05:54.389> cracked<00:05:55.389> exactly<00:05:56.199> like<00:05:56.440> this

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
got this from cracked exactly like this

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.419 
got this from cracked exactly like this
all<00:05:57.790> over<00:05:58.270> it
