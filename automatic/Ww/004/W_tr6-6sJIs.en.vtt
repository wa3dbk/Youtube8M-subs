00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.120
 Good evening 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:15.370
 The title hasn't changed yet, but it 's time for a kind of sound- friendly drawing work 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:23.410
 Last week or two more times since I entered the students and studied, I was able to extend 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:26.500
 Well, it 's very easy to understand if you 're new to me than when I'm writing alone 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.110
 Ya Do a good heart or even listening to the opinion that it was 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.400
 Well me 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:36.830
 And now because that I did not notice you're doing alone earthquake came out a square after all 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.140
 It's a weird thing to understand such a place for the first time, so it's like that until now I myself 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.390
 I know that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.010
 There is to say by not standing out Mashiten 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.730
 And always will be 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:53.880
 We would like to gulp continue with Himeko-chan of political parties 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:01.350
 With the ea in a visual Ha published first first Osarai of you is Kedomo the next 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:04.050
 It put a representative to that of the shape different from the forever a little month rate by changing the year of the original lecture 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 What do you do today? 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.830
 This tiny wine drink bottle 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.330
 It seems that this is amazingly a huge hurdle expensive. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:21.180
 At first one of them is transparent 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.730
 You should write in transparent competition and this transparent and water from it 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.990
 I 'm shining 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.350
 I do this in are certain process concept is the way you do not know what going to if I even those things 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 Ne 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 I thing that should I Haitai also saw I bet high-end 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.270
 This is what I want to write in real 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.040
 Because the world seen through in the round glass went very fracture 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.070
 The background is more difficult to understand as the individual gets thinner 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.070
 Then how glass this here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.080
 Or say let's show 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.840
 I think that it will be this technical story rather than a little noise decision, but 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.200
 I would like to write this using color for the first time this time 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.510
 The splash you Kedomo I'm a child of the legal wife than usual to use 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.380
 Highline becha 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.170
 It is not so much deep meaning even though this is I water-soluble 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.230
 Using people 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.680
 Of course I can use a pencil, but today I happened to have a big Buddha at hand 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:25.959
 Or the moat of it when I meet Hikineko-chan did not write using the so-called people around me who is this green 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.550
 See what it looks like to be potted and using a purple pen 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.860
 Is 8 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.910
 Let's stand will wish the camera Torikao 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 First of all, there is no fruit that sticks to that form 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.060
 Because you may distort the saw circle line 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.420
 First of all, please take the outline of the bottom effect first 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.870
 Well how many times I was alone 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 Don't bother with the back label 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.230
 Full 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:04.959
 It will be difficult if you try to write nicely 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.959
 A little distorted because not finish there are in bloom also do not know funny 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.530
 I'm using the purple hits to use the green 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.130
 Oh Kedomo I'm not a predator 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.319
 And Takeda it was funny senna change went through a little you were what beautiful'm good 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.230
 This was unfair 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.569
 From 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.850
 The left is nice 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.660
 Because there is time, it is quite 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.200
 Are you sure you want to continue 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.450
 Good I'll go 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.450
 Because it was new when there before cormorants 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.510
 Purity N 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.120
 Please paint 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.120
 It is you been told something like that is abandon flow 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:02.130
 In the past where I was conscious or write well 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.130
 It thickness of the bottom of the difference between the fine and the rod of the nail did not say 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.230
 I can not 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.389
 Part of the cap 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.039
 Let's go choose 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.250
 I went into the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:54.200
 And then than we are painted a color from the other once Riko' out to the woman of Nechotto palette 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.200
 But first let 'We here have seen become basic 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:06.889
 I do not think necessarily go Damn it I suddenly or the image of the glass 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:11.210
 First of all, I also know that I often remember this time 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:17.110
 Glass is a hard thing to think about the thing of texture 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.830
 I will post the cherry tree to a certain side vertical if as much as possible deflation 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.970
 Let me do it for a moment 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:28.250
 Paddles you sure you want is a little on the branch in the direction of this purple 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.250
 Mr. technology is not doing it
