leaf<00:01:32.090> surface<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:33.380> fruit<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
leaf surface to fruit so that the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.120 
leaf surface to fruit so that the
sweetness<00:01:35.780> can<00:01:36.050> form<00:01:36.319> in<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.500> fruit<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:36.950> they

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
sweetness can form in the fruit and they

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.770 
sweetness can form in the fruit and they
can<00:01:37.280> bulk<00:01:37.459> up<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.940> size<00:01:38.119> that's<00:01:38.509> going<00:01:38.720> to

going to thin the fruit out and what
we're<00:02:59.360> getting<00:02:59.510> here<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.990> about<00:03:00.320> 6<00:03:00.830> inches

a little bit put me back into the camera
bit<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.350> essentially<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.070> I'm<00:03:07.370> trying

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
to do about that distance of fruit

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500 
to do about that distance of fruit
between<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.220> you've<00:03:10.550> done<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.030> sign<00:03:11.300> before

about 6 inches between there however
that's<00:03:15.020> not<00:03:15.170> six<00:03:15.650> inches<00:03:15.800> in<00:03:16.130> all<00:03:16.370> directions

if I have a single piece of fruit then I
look<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.400> say<00:03:19.550> if<00:03:19.610> there's<00:03:19.910> something<00:03:20.150> more

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
look and say if there's something more

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.449 
look and say if there's something more
than<00:03:20.450> six<00:03:20.690> inches<00:03:20.900> closer<00:03:21.320> somewhere<00:03:21.890> else<00:03:22.100> I

than six inches closer somewhere else I

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.800 
than six inches closer somewhere else I
need<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.060> get<00:03:23.209> rid<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.480> it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810

stem ok and what you're going to do is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.620 
stem ok and what you're going to do is
you're<00:03:28.790> always<00:03:28.910> going<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.180> look<00:03:29.300> for<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.510> most

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
you're always going to look for the most

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.560 
you're always going to look for the most

before we get to work on this is when

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.970 
before we get to work on this is when
you<00:03:40.820> go<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.060> remove<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.690> fruit<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.200> generally

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
you go to remove the fruit you generally

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.150 
you go to remove the fruit you generally

if you pull it back towards the trunk of
the<00:03:53.209> tree<00:03:53.239> what's<00:03:54.080> going<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.350> happen<00:03:54.739> is

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
the tree what's going to happen is

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.960 
the tree what's going to happen is
you're<00:03:54.980> most<00:03:55.160> likely<00:03:55.400> going<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.640> peel<00:03:55.910> off

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
you're most likely going to peel off

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.180 
you're most likely going to peel off
some<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.570> tender<00:03:56.900> bark<00:03:57.170> that's<00:03:57.739> forming

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
some of the tender bark that's forming

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.770 
some of the tender bark that's forming
at<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.459> time<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.820> year<00:03:58.880> it's<00:03:59.060> not<00:03:59.150> really<00:03:59.480> set

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
at this time of year it's not really set

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.470 
at this time of year it's not really set
it's<00:04:00.170> kind<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.530> slip<00:04:01.430> stage<00:04:01.790> at<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.180> point

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
it's kind of a slip stage at this point

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.539 
it's kind of a slip stage at this point
so<00:04:03.049> you're<00:04:03.170> going<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.350> pull<00:04:03.590> away<00:04:03.860> from<00:04:04.190> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
so you're going to pull away from the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.670 
so you're going to pull away from the
trunk<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.000> tree<00:04:05.030> it'll<00:04:05.780> snap<00:04:05.989> off<00:04:06.290> cleanly

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
trunk of the tree it'll snap off cleanly

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.229 
trunk of the tree it'll snap off cleanly
let's<00:04:07.310> go<00:04:07.430> ahead<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.640> get<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.850> work

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
let's go ahead and get to work

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.229 
let's go ahead and get to work
what<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.840> can<00:04:08.959> see<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:10.310> fruit<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.790> forming

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
only two on this that's not a little

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.040 
only two on this that's not a little
less<00:05:21.770> than<00:05:22.069> six<00:05:22.340> inches<00:05:22.699> but<00:05:23.479> that's<00:05:23.689> alright

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
less than six inches but that's alright

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.879 
less than six inches but that's alright
I'm<00:05:24.199> going<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.379> go<00:05:24.469> ahead<00:05:24.529> and<00:05:24.710> leave<00:05:24.860> it

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
I'm going to go ahead and leave it

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.559 
I'm going to go ahead and leave it
because<00:05:25.279> they're<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.430> lot<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.849> leaf<00:05:26.060> canopy

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
because they're a lot of leaf canopy

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.659 
because they're a lot of leaf canopy
here<00:05:26.779> more<00:05:27.409> than<00:05:27.560> enough<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:28.039> feed<00:05:28.279> that<00:05:28.490> if

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
here more than enough to feed that if

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.879 
here more than enough to feed that if
I'm<00:05:28.789> keeping<00:05:28.939> things<00:05:29.330> in<00:05:29.479> ratio<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.169> I<00:05:30.650> can

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
I'm keeping things in ratio and I can

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.649 
I'm keeping things in ratio and I can
just<00:05:31.069> work<00:05:31.370> through<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:31.789> rest<00:05:31.819> of<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.389> tree

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
just work through the rest of the tree

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.230 
just work through the rest of the tree
the<00:05:32.900> same<00:05:33.139> way<00:05:33.379> there's<00:05:34.189> a<00:05:34.250> single<00:05:34.699> one<00:05:34.879> here

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
the same way there's a single one here

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.839 
the same way there's a single one here
notice<00:05:35.599> there<00:05:36.020> we're<00:05:36.229> okay<00:05:36.620> here's<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.550> little

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
notice there we're okay here's a little

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.740 
notice there we're okay here's a little
guy<00:05:38.000> over<00:05:38.270> there<00:05:38.419> all<00:05:38.569> by<00:05:38.599> himself<00:05:40.659> going<00:05:41.659> to

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
guy over there all by himself going to

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.350 
guy over there all by himself going to
leave<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:41.960> alone<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.729> goes<00:05:44.000> through

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
leave that alone and so it goes through

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540 
leave that alone and so it goes through
the<00:05:44.449> rest<00:05:44.689> of<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.960> tree<00:05:45.229> why<00:05:45.830> not<00:05:46.069> wait<00:05:46.279> until

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
the rest of the tree why not wait until

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.519 
the rest of the tree why not wait until
they're<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.729> little<00:05:46.909> bit<00:05:47.120> bigger<00:05:47.389> the<00:05:48.110> reason

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
they're a little bit bigger the reason

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.619 
they're a little bit bigger the reason
for<00:05:48.740> that<00:05:48.800> is<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:49.430> longer<00:05:49.849> this<00:05:50.060> fruit<00:05:50.330> is<00:05:50.479> on

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629 
for that is the longer this fruit is on

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.300 
for that is the longer this fruit is on
the<00:05:50.779> tree<00:05:51.020> now<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.289> more<00:05:51.680> energy<00:05:52.159> and

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
the tree now the more energy and

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.459 
the tree now the more energy and
resources<00:05:52.849> the<00:05:53.509> tree<00:05:53.779> will<00:05:53.960> put<00:05:54.139> into<00:05:54.259> that

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
resources the tree will put into that

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.159 
resources the tree will put into that
fruit<00:05:54.860> leaving<00:05:55.729> less<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.389> distribute<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.050> the

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
fruit leaving less to distribute to the
