00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's got a few Edelbrock parts here the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
it's got a few Edelbrock parts here the
manifolds<00:00:47.280> drastically<00:00:47.940> being<00:00:48.150> changed<00:00:49.250> but

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
manifolds drastically being changed but

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.009 
manifolds drastically being changed but
it<00:00:50.339> runs<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.730> good<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> drove<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.839> here

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
it runs out good I drove this over here

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.420 
it runs out good I drove this over here
it's<00:00:52.170> got<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.470> of<00:00:52.530> power<00:00:52.799> it's<00:00:53.129> hard<00:00:53.339> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it's got a lot of power it's hard to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.369 
it's got a lot of power it's hard to
tell<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> difference<00:00:53.729> when<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.269> LX<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.809> GT

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
tell the difference when the LX and GT

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
tell the difference when the LX and GT
in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:57.619> example<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.659> tell<00:01:00.689> that<00:01:00.869> is<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in this example and I can tell that is a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
in this example and I can tell that is a
much<00:01:01.470> larger<00:01:02.159> a<00:01:03.350> radiator<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.739> stock<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
much larger a radiator here stock I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
much larger a radiator here stock I
don't<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.869> felt<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.350> plenty<00:01:07.640> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
don't know it felt like I had plenty I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.870 
don't know it felt like I had plenty I
do<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.479> racing<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> against<00:01:10.290> anything

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
do I'm not racing it against anything

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.210 
do I'm not racing it against anything
but<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> runs<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.240> good<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> air<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.780> cold

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
but it runs out good that air is cold

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.390 
but it runs out good that air is cold
that<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> fiberglass<00:01:15.030> hood<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that is a fiberglass hood and I think it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
that is a fiberglass hood and I think it
looks<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.670> great<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.509> used<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
these fox bodies but that looks really

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.169
