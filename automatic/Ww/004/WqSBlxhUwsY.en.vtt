00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.979 
up and force you to try this but man the
chocolate<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.569> know<00:02:23.660> gives<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.959> that

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
chocolate you know gives it that

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.500 
chocolate you know gives it that
chocolate<00:02:24.500> flavor<00:02:24.709> but<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.819> sugar<00:02:26.150> cookie

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
chocolate flavor but that sugar cookie

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.940 
chocolate flavor but that sugar cookie
you<00:02:26.630> get<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.900> taste<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> sugar<00:02:27.709> cookie

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
sugar cookies aren't necessarily

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.360
