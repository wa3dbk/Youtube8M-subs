00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.770
 from the piece piece of mine from the beginning of 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.130
 the 80s 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.950
 this song is about a battle 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.410
 between 600 English soldiers and the 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.030
 Russian army because a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 misunderstanding in the shadow of a general 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.830

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.500

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.650

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.110
 hope of freedom to know revolt 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.110
 if you have citrus 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.479

 and soft amaranth but also it is not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.950
 very thick 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.440
 a pretty citrus flavor 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.100
