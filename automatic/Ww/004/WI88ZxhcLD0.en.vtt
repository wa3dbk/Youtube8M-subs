00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
even know if he has feet either that's a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.650 
even know if he has feet either that's a
big<00:03:06.900> foot<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.530> someone<00:03:08.459> or<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:09.239> that's<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
big foot on someone or get that's a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.930 
big foot on someone or get that's a
mermaid<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.550> can<00:03:11.730> tell<00:03:11.910> us

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
mermaid and then this one I can tell us

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.640 
mermaid and then this one I can tell us
probably<00:03:12.239> matches<00:03:12.750> these<00:03:12.930> kind<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.260> spikes

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
probably matches these kind of spikes

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.949 
probably matches these kind of spikes
and<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.550> thing<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.360> I'm<00:03:15.420> guessing<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.840> like

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
and this thing so I'm guessing is like

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.280 
and this thing so I'm guessing is like
some<00:03:16.110> type<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.320> mage<00:03:16.650> or<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.220> Negro<00:03:17.550> man<00:03:17.700> sir

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
some type of mage or like Negro man sir

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.720 
some type of mage or like Negro man sir
and<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.380> we<00:03:19.470> got<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> giant<00:03:20.070> one<00:03:20.340> over<00:03:20.550> here

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and then we got this giant one over here

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
and then we got this giant one over here
like<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> freaking<00:03:21.360> Hulkbuster<00:03:22.140> um<00:03:22.370> who

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
like the freaking Hulkbuster um who

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.270 
like the freaking Hulkbuster um who
looks<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:23.820> huge<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.500> I'd<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.769> pretty<00:03:25.920> cooking
