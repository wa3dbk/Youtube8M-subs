00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
again as I already have many videos on

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.930 
again as I already have many videos on
the<00:00:52.230> benefits<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.830> one<00:00:53.070> gloater<00:00:53.340> blade<00:00:53.670> over

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to just listen to the train nice glasses

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.100 
to just listen to the train nice glasses
thank<00:00:58.020> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200 

always<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.340> to<00:01:05.430> video<00:01:05.700> something<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
always when I want to video something to

I<00:01:12.400> really<00:01:12.910> don't<00:01:13.030> want<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.270> train<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.870> got<00:01:13.990> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
I really don't want to train you got to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 

then<00:01:19.770> we'll<00:01:19.950> live<00:01:20.100> down<00:01:20.310> Sunday<00:01:20.729> mornings

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
then we'll live down Sunday mornings

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
then we'll live down Sunday mornings
during<00:01:21.450> tour<00:01:22.310> how<00:01:23.310> long<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> fly<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
during tour how long you want to fly a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.960 
during tour how long you want to fly a
helicopter<00:01:24.270> Scout<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> different<00:01:25.439> sound

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.250 

we'll<00:01:33.970> notice<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.300> more<00:01:34.540> noise<00:01:34.780> comes<00:01:35.140> from

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
we'll notice that more noise comes from

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.790 
we'll notice that more noise comes from
BSC<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.250> motor<00:01:36.460> than<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.790> GaN<00:01:37.060> blade

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
BSC and the motor than the GaN blade

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.630 
BSC and the motor than the GaN blade
because<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:38.920> didn't<00:01:39.160> know<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.370> know

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
because you didn't know you know

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.520 
because you didn't know you know
brushless<00:01:39.940> motors<00:01:40.540> beep<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.930> couple<00:01:41.260> times

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
brushless motors beep a couple times

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.740 
brushless motors beep a couple times
when<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:41.950> first<00:01:42.160> start<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.150> they<00:01:43.330> beep<00:01:43.510> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
when you first start but they beep so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.540 
when you first start but they beep so
fast<00:01:44.080> during<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.560> running<00:01:45.010> that<00:01:45.370> they

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
fast during the running that they

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.490 
fast during the running that they
actually<00:01:45.940> create<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.450> screaming<00:01:46.870> sound<00:01:47.290> at

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
actually create that screaming sound at

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.210 
actually create that screaming sound at
speed<00:01:48.810> I've<00:01:49.810> got<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.110> gyro<00:01:50.500> disconnected

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
speed I've got the gyro disconnected

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.920 
speed I've got the gyro disconnected
because<00:01:51.340> actually<00:01:51.910> there's<00:01:52.150> less<00:01:52.510> torque

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
because actually there's less torque

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.840 
because actually there's less torque
with<00:01:53.170> one<00:01:53.380> blade<00:01:53.620> too<00:01:53.980> so<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.490> don't<00:01:54.700> really

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
with one blade too so I don't really

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:15.059 
with one blade too so I don't really
need<00:01:55.150> it

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:34.440 

those<00:02:15.640> trees<00:02:16.000> over<00:02:16.269> here

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.059 

that's<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.350> much<00:02:35.620> lift<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.280> can't<00:02:36.610> believe<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.360> I

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's so much lift I can't believe it I

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.100 
that's so much lift I can't believe it I
mean<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.850> put<00:02:40.060> school<00:02:40.420> forward<00:02:40.959> on

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
mean I have to put school forward on

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.820 
mean I have to put school forward on
this<00:02:41.290> these<00:02:41.530> people<00:02:42.010> climbing<00:02:42.700> out

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:03:02.740 

you<00:02:47.250> gotta<00:02:47.460> know<00:02:47.640> how

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.980 

you<00:03:03.530> know<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.860> sound<00:03:04.100> yep

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.620
