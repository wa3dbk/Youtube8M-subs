00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.560
 in the long half hour no more than that the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.560
 take it out and have it unfold 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 but what I want to show you is what 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 let's see if such is that there is no 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 the butter will escape inside as 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.460
 solve the current problem not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 he went through because he participates he usually happens 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.310
 by the texture of the dough well we 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.430
 we have saved the mass like that with the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.800
 double wall in front we take out the house of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 the vega we turn it well 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.440
 and so we start to stretch well and go 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.860
 to see if butter is already seen 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 that has a couple of doublets to see if the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 Butter is starting to escape or not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.489
 this expert does not escape every summer 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.489
 he pays us the proportion 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:10.390
 here a little bit if the camera sees it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:13.660
 it seems that there are hundreds of layers 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.660
 to break it we break the capo faith of the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.830
 butter we do not get angry and we make a 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.920
 bun 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:29.920
 no no no 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 a little corn called party 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.820
 we do the laps again 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 and this goes back to the refrigerator or this is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.140
 we have to have stretched more 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.700
 but good that what I wanted to show you 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 and that's why I tell you that the mass is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.960
 very brittle very well they do not 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.380
 wants as day to stretch and life 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 return 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.149
 we put a little life profile 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.680
 Well, when we throw ourselves again 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:11.760
 the least three of stress to do it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.700
 the folds correct 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.060
 because of the three times there is if it kills 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.069
 the last clip we give it more good 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.860
 wide so that the matter remains 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.780
 how much more is said said good already exists 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.480
 more time to the refrigerator recommendation 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.760
 the croissants in the afternoon we started 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.890
 early in the morning, if the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 we want for breakfast we start the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 previous day at night well and we left 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.490
 that the cancer brand all night 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.640
 having told you this 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.630
 a lot of work 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.630
 but it's worth it 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.030
 in the last round freeze the dough 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.920
 perhaps to have it planned or the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.100
 the frozen croissants for another day 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.620
 look I never actually freeze the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.620
 mass but frozen are the croissants 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.670
 and freeze them and answers and if the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 you take out the last tap 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:29.049
 actually we make between half 12 and 18 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.510
 moon well depending on the thickness or the 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.519
 size we make the median and I want 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.480
 learn to make an average the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.480
 electricity 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.709
 because we have a estiradita because 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.959
 times when we stretch it too 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.959
 then we have to leave it, I feel like it 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.830
 we will also be in that stretch 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.750
 super easy as well as clear 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.790
 any type of butter crescent 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.580
 that you are going to do even if it is not 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.100
 for coeliacs has the same job 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.850
 because I have stayed in tent 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.950
 the study the only difference as 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.890
 this is a more sensitive mass you can 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.060
 break if it can be transfused if the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.060
 manteca but the impact 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.440
 It's going to be a little thicker than the other 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.420
 the view and we throw ourselves sometimes 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.730
 a little more finite to make half moon 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.470
 the truth to the barrier a little bit further back 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.320
 it's a bit soft, it 's a good brand 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.700
 come on now because they will be medium less 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:45.940
 in a whole 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.940
 It would be a plastic donut 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.280
 except that it was no longer very cold like that 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.060
 you have to treat her with affection well in the 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.060
 kitchen 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.380
 the bits that are taking the blows 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.230
 to paste and so these intervals 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.330
 isosceles triangles afternoon of fear 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.230
 there are some for this day with 55 people and 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.230
 the divine vocation 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.740
 they lose their fear 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:27.139
 once the croissants rest 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.509
 we put in a plate there we leave it 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.889
 rest 20 minutes to see how it's going to 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:38.330
 Grow a little bit with your finger first 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:46.249
 well from the base but equal of the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:49.099
 base that I'm not pulling a little bit of 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.710
 here and at the widest part little 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.900
 so that it does not break though the closure 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.880
 for me not 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.280
 so I did not feel the plate that has to 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.280
 have nothing nothing flour nothing 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.110
 he did everything right at the end of the course 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:13.829
 if you want the arch 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.639
 Of course another detail we also leave them 

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:17.189
 rest 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.479
 in a templadito place but not with 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.659
 excess heat 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.029
 because if lola butter starts 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:28.969
 to escape or there are masses that do not 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.969
 we have gluten is even worse 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:45.449
 after 20 minutes I rest from 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:48.839
 a rather strong oven 190 200 more 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.969
 notes in your house of medium strong there is in 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:53.639
 the intermediate between 4 and even our 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.789
 effort very well guys and between 10 and 12 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.789
 minutes 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.730
 such fictionalization
