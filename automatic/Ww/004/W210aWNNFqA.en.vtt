 we look at the core the pixma mx525 and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.209
 under a printer with fax function 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.400
 which allows you to wireless business 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.730
 documents or articles but also photos 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730
 can print 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.750
 included with the mx 525 word offset 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 cartridges usb cable power cord and one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 telephone cable 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 it is made of shiny black 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 plastic and it looks stylish and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 fits easily into any interior 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 the large buttons ensure in combination 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 with the color display for one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.809
 easy and uncluttered 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.910
 operation of the printer 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.809
 the mx 525 has a lot of fours 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.699
 save costs 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.640
 this is how you save paper with the duplex module 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.350
 by automatically printing on both sides 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.330
 I also have fine cartridges 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 available here you have a higher one 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.940
 page yield at a cheaper price 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.339
 price 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 you print with black up to 420 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.449
 pages and with colored ink up to 220 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 pages more than with a normal one 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 ink cartridge the mx 525 is a nice one 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.040
 printer for small business or 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 home use 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.820
 it has a wifi receiver and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 ethernet connection and therefore you can 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.460
 connect it both wired and wireless 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 on the network 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 after that you can of course print directly 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 via the network but you can also 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.660
 send print jobs from you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 smartphone or tablet and print app 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.980
 Available for Android Windows RT and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 Aos me naturally also supports Apple 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.470
 airprint 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.150
 because it is an all-in-one printer 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.010
 you can easily copy and scan with 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.110
 the built-in scanner but it has 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.120
 also about a fax function 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 he an adr who saved a lot of time 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.990
 because you use this to 30 pages per 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 times with a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.980
 print resolution of 48100 at 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.760
 twelve hundred dp a razor-sharp print 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.760

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.570
 printer for home use and the small one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.550
 entrepreneur 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 However, a disadvantage is that it does not 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.510
 has individual cartridges per color 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 apart from this it is a very nice one 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.380
 printer with all the functions you need 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.510

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.140
 value for money 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.909
