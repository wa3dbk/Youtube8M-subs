00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 At first glance, there is this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 young man and nothing in this picture 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 to improve 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.380
 At least not when it comes to skin retouching 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.540
 but first of all , there is always 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.570
 blemishes that should disappear 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.859
 and secondly, cut pro can do more than 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 make pimple disappear 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.609
 I am markus baur and I am showing now 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.609
 what cut pro can do 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.550
 at first the picture marked us 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.759
 improve volt and click 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 we zoom in with the mouse wheel 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.329
 a bit bigger 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.879
 then it goes to the left for improvement 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.110
 and mend the brush error 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.629
 use the size of me as a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.350
 adjust a bit and then once here 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 click on this little birthmark 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.690
 Zack already that it disappeared 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.510
 Here we have something else here too 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 we have something left you can see in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.719
 second fractions are the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.719
 blemishes disappeared 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.369
 but this picture still looks 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.770
 somehow wrong that's because 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.500
 that the right eye is seen from us 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 a little smaller than the left one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 probably the young man has 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.080
 just a little bit too early 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.140
 with cut pro, it's no problem 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.140
 We will simply shape the eyes and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 adjust size once to improve 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.049
 Click and then on the form change 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.720
 Of course, brush is so big now 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.200
 we'll scale that down a bit 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.140
 Okay, about this value 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.630
 and now we go to the bottom 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.460
 of the eye and the whole one more 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.450
 pull up a bit 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.040
 now the eyes are the same size and that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.320
 picture becomes much more symmetrical 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.320
 fun while copying with cut pro
