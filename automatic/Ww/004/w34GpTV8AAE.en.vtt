another module case and today i'm going
to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.960> reviewing<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.710> quicksand<00:00:41.250> mod<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
to be reviewing the quicksand mod and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
to be reviewing the quicksand mod and
this<00:00:42.870> mod<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.080> exactly<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.129> called

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this mod is exactly what it's called

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's just a small little mod that adds
in<00:00:47.879> quicksand<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:49.790> don't<00:00:50.790> see<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.180> modern<00:00:51.780> i

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
in quicksand and don't see a modern i

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.190 
in quicksand and don't see a modern i
think<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.540> i'll<00:00:54.540> only<00:00:54.720> get<00:00:54.989> 250<00:00:59.000> 000<00:01:00.200> sub

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
quicksand will fall like normal sand

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
quicksand will fall like normal sand
also<00:01:33.560> there<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.590> quicksand<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.549> looks<00:01:35.729> just

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
also there is quicksand that looks just

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.640 
also there is quicksand that looks just
like<00:01:36.060> normal<00:01:36.299> San<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.140> spawn<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like normal San that will spawn in the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
like normal San that will spawn in the
desert<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> you'll<00:01:38.729> fall<00:01:39.090> straight<00:01:39.450> down

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
desert and you'll fall straight down

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
desert and you'll fall straight down
into<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> bottom<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> sorts<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
into it down to the bottom of sorts of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
into it down to the bottom of sorts of
King<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.880> away<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.840> easier<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.320> get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
King right away it's a lot easier to get

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
King right away it's a lot easier to get
auto<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.280> cannot<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
auto but you cannot see it it's on for

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.370 
auto but you cannot see it it's on for
desert<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.500> spawns<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.729> swamps<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
desert this spawns a lot in swamps and a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
desert this spawns a lot in swamps and a
little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> jungles<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.750> spawns<00:01:52.080> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
little bit in jungles and the spawns and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.539 
little bit in jungles and the spawns and
beaches<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.979> deserts<00:01:53.869> okay<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.770> i<00:01:56.100> actually

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
beaches and deserts okay now i actually

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.700 
beaches and deserts okay now i actually
have<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:58.079> crafting<00:01:58.619> recipes<00:01:59.130> I<00:02:00.259> know<00:02:01.259> what

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
have the crafting recipes I know what

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.330 
have the crafting recipes I know what
you're<00:02:01.860> thinking<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.950> random<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you're thinking that was random and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.410 
you're thinking that was random and
stupid<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.729> anyway<00:02:06.180> k<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.259> open<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:09.239> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
stupid but anyway k let's open this is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
stupid but anyway k let's open this is
how<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.959> create<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.350> normal<00:02:11.009> quicksand

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
how you can create a normal quicksand

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.750 
how you can create a normal quicksand
you<00:02:12.060> need<00:02:12.209> three<00:02:12.480> sand<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.079> top<00:02:13.760> three

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you need three sand on the top three

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
you need three sand on the top three
dirt<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.480> bottom<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.019> on<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
dirt on the bottom and on the very

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.990 
dirt on the bottom and on the very
bottom<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.070> need<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> water<00:02:17.459> bucket<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> that

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
bottom we need a water bucket and that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.819 
bottom we need a water bucket and that
gets<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.299> normal<00:02:18.600> quicksand<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
gets you a normal quicksand I think it

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.850 
gets you a normal quicksand I think it
gives<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.130> six<00:02:20.579> clips<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.269> I'm<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.860> same

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
gives you six clips and I'm not same

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740 
gives you six clips and I'm not same
thing<00:02:23.070> with<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.640> except<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.510> just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
thing with the little except you just

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.500 
thing with the little except you just
put<00:02:24.930> through<00:02:25.260> sand<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.829> way<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.940> sand<00:02:27.209> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
put through sand this way and to sand on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.600 
put through sand this way and to sand on
the<00:02:27.810> horse<00:02:28.470> hand<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.860> corners<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.459> once

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the horse hand in the corners and once

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.289 
the horse hand in the corners and once
in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> middle<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.110> dry<00:02:31.530> quicksand

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
in the middle you get a dry quicksand

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.300 
in the middle you get a dry quicksand
which<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.480> supposed<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:33.989> called<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.470> now

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
which is supposed to be called and now

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.140 
which is supposed to be called and now
i'm<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> watch<00:02:36.209> an<00:02:36.420> Enderman

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
i'm going to watch an Enderman

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.890 
i'm going to watch an Enderman
it<00:02:37.209> sucked<00:02:37.569> into<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.959> quicksand<00:02:38.140> oh<00:02:39.900> yeah

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it sucked into the quicksand oh yeah

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.809 
it sucked into the quicksand oh yeah
haha<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.879> working<00:02:43.000> yeah<00:02:43.860> oh<00:02:46.470> wait<00:02:47.519> wait<00:02:48.519> is
