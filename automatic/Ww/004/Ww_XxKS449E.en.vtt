00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
picking this perk for two reasons the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.090 
picking this perk for two reasons the
first<00:04:40.210> is<00:04:40.660> if<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:40.960> find<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.350> frequently<00:04:41.860> run

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
first is if you find you frequently run

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.310 
first is if you find you frequently run
out<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.340> ammo<00:04:42.520> with<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.940> certain<00:04:43.360> class<00:04:43.660> but

out of ammo with a certain class but

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.710 
out of ammo with a certain class but
this<00:04:44.440> will<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.740> rare<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.910> second<00:04:46.300> reason<00:04:46.450> is

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
this will be rare the second reason is

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.210 
this will be rare the second reason is
if<00:04:46.870> replenishing<00:04:47.410> grenades<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.010> what's

if replenishing grenades is what's
