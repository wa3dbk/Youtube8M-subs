going to be utilizing the move coil

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.800 
going to be utilizing the move coil
which<00:00:19.439> boosts<00:00:19.890> electro<00:00:20.310> says<00:00:20.580> attack<00:00:21.150> defense

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
which boosts electro says attack defense

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.189 
which boosts electro says attack defense
and<00:00:21.930> accuracy<00:00:22.890> all<00:00:23.100> by<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.880> stage<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:25.050> of

those boost will help elect Ross with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.990 
those boost will help elect Ross with
his<00:00:27.689> other<00:00:27.900> three<00:00:27.990> attacks<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.699> his

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
his other three attacks and with his

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
his other three attacks and with his
performance<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> battle<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.650> Zack<00:00:32.520> cannon<00:00:33.090> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
performance in battle so Zack cannon as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479 
performance in battle so Zack cannon as
the<00:00:33.510> second<00:00:33.899> move<00:00:34.079> electrons<00:00:35.010> gets<00:00:35.219> stabbed

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the second move electrons gets stabbed

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
the second move electrons gets stabbed
on<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> hundred<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> twenty<00:00:37.710> base

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
on it it has a hundred and twenty base

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
on it it has a hundred and twenty base
power<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> hitting<00:00:39.030> hard<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
power so it's gonna be hitting hard and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.530 
power so it's gonna be hitting hard and
it<00:00:40.200> has<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> 100<00:00:41.280> percent<00:00:41.670> chance<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.149> paralyze

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it has a 100 percent chance to paralyze

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
it has a 100 percent chance to paralyze
the<00:00:42.750> opponent<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> connects<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the opponent if it connects now of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
the opponent if it connects now of
course<00:00:44.760> its<00:00:45.000> accuracy<00:00:45.450> isn't<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.930> great<00:00:46.230> which

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
course its accuracy isn't so great which

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
course its accuracy isn't so great which
is<00:00:46.860> also<00:00:47.070> another<00:00:47.520> plus<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> running<00:00:48.690> coil<00:00:48.989> as

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is also another plus for running coil as

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
is also another plus for running coil as
it<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.770> patch<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.399> bad<00:00:50.550> accuracy<00:00:51.239> after

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it will patch up it's bad accuracy after

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.830 
it will patch up it's bad accuracy after
one<00:00:52.050> coil<00:00:52.379> zap<00:00:52.770> cannon<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.840> 66

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
one coil zap cannon will be at about 66

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
one coil zap cannon will be at about 66
percent<00:00:55.219> accuracy<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.550> after<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.480> coils<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
percent accuracy and after two coils it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.430 
percent accuracy and after two coils it
will<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> bumped<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.149> 83<00:01:00.149> percent<00:01:00.440> accurate

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
will be bumped up to 83 percent accurate

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
will be bumped up to 83 percent accurate
which<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> fire<00:01:03.059> blast<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
which is about a fire blast so that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.859 
which is about a fire blast so that
definitely<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:05.250> enough<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.630> Elektra<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
definitely is good enough for Elektra to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.500 
definitely is good enough for Elektra to
run<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.350> third<00:01:08.250> moving<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> move<00:01:08.820> set<00:01:09.090> we've

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
run and third moving the move set we've

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.020 
run and third moving the move set we've
got<00:01:09.780> drain<00:01:10.229> punch<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.520> boosted<00:01:12.000> by

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
got drain punch which will be boosted by

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
got drain punch which will be boosted by
the<00:01:12.180> attack<00:01:12.600> boost<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:12.990> coil<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> when

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the attack boost from coil and when

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
the attack boost from coil and when
paired<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.729> leftovers<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.750> electrons

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
paired with leftovers and electrons

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
paired with leftovers and electrons
using<00:01:16.890> drain<00:01:17.250> punch<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.060> definitely<00:01:18.659> gives

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
using drain punch it definitely gives

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
using drain punch it definitely gives
electron<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.470> longevity<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.759> battle<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
electron some longevity in a battle to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
electron some longevity in a battle to
be<00:01:21.479> able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> keep<00:01:21.960> boosting<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.830> keep

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
be able to keep boosting or just keep

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
be able to keep boosting or just keep
attacking<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.180> very<00:01:24.390> good<00:01:24.960> move<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
attacking things so very good move and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
attacking things so very good move and
finally<00:01:26.220> knock<00:01:26.549> off<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> course<00:01:27.270> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
finally knock off which of course is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.390 
finally knock off which of course is
also<00:01:28.080> boosted<00:01:28.560> by<00:01:28.710> coils<00:01:29.540> stat<00:01:30.540> increases<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
also boosted by coils stat increases and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
also boosted by coils stat increases and
in<00:01:32.400> Gen<00:01:32.729> 6<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.960> move<00:01:34.170> able<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in Gen 6 it's a very good move able to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
in Gen 6 it's a very good move able to
knock<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.430> items<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.140> take<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
knock off items as well as take on the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.240 
knock off items as well as take on the
mid<00:01:38.189> things<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> slow<00:01:39.299> King<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:40.170> better<00:01:40.500> if

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
mid things like slow King much better if

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
mid things like slow King much better if
you're<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.579> already<00:01:41.850> boosted<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.659> coil

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're not already boosted up with coil

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440 
you're not already boosted up with coil
and<00:01:43.259> yeah<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.520> an<00:01:44.640> all-around<00:01:44.939> great<00:01:45.149> move

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and yeah just an all-around great move

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410 
and yeah just an all-around great move
so<00:01:45.829> next<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.250> gonna<00:01:47.399> move<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> V's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so next up just gonna move on to the V's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.469 
so next up just gonna move on to the V's
and<00:01:48.689> nature<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.770> will<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.009> running<00:01:50.329> 250<00:01:51.329> two

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and nature we will be running 250 two

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.639 
and nature we will be running 250 two
V's<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.740> Electress<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.670> its<00:01:54.000> HP<00:01:54.270> stat<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
V's for Electress in its HP stat so that

pretty decent opening here to get a
couple<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.709> coil<00:03:46.370> or<00:03:46.519> two<00:03:46.730> up<00:03:46.910> with<00:03:47.239> electrons

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
couple a coil or two up with electrons

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.710 
couple a coil or two up with electrons
so<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:49.220> starting<00:03:49.459> up<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.700> first<00:03:49.940> one<00:03:50.209> they

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430
