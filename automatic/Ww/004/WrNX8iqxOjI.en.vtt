many<00:01:51.540> subscribers<00:01:51.960> he's<00:01:52.530> probably<00:01:52.799> always

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
many subscribers he's probably always

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
many subscribers he's probably always
had<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.759> many<00:01:53.970> subscribers<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.600> people

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
had this many subscribers and people

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
had this many subscribers and people
often<00:01:55.049> forget<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.070> haven't<00:01:56.340> seen

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.969 
often forget if they haven't seen
something<00:01:57.270> grow<00:01:57.570> throughout<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.829> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
something grow throughout the time that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
something grow throughout the time that
there<00:01:59.100> were<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.280> huge<00:01:59.640> periods<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.540> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there were these huge periods of just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
there were these huge periods of just
like<00:02:01.790> sudden<00:02:02.790> rapid<00:02:03.299> expansion<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:05.340> all

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
like sudden rapid expansion and it's all

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.399 
like sudden rapid expansion and it's all
because<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.119> hard<00:02:06.360> work<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.020> guys<00:02:07.170> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because of hard work that you guys have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
because of hard work that you guys have
done<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> help<00:02:07.890> grow<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> channel<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> all

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
done to help grow the channel and all

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.550 
done to help grow the channel and all
that<00:02:09.569> blood<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.110> sweat<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.379> tears<00:02:10.619> well<00:02:10.890> not

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that blood and sweat and tears well not

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.650 
that blood and sweat and tears well not
I'm<00:02:12.130> not<00:02:12.459> saying<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.150> equivalent<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
I'm not saying like it's equivalent to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.630 
I'm not saying like it's equivalent to
coal<00:02:14.290> mining<00:02:14.680> or<00:02:14.770> anything<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.190> but

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
coal mining or anything like that but

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.580 
coal mining or anything like that but
it's<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.480> really<00:02:16.780> all<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> legwork<00:02:17.200> that's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it's it's really all the legwork that's

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.090 
it's it's really all the legwork that's
done<00:02:17.950> by<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.580> viewers<00:02:19.120> early<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.830> really

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
done by the viewers early on that really

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800 
done by the viewers early on that really
drives<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.490> channel<00:02:21.760> forward<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.510> can't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
drives a channel forward and I can't

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.890 
drives a channel forward and I can't
thank<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.080> guys<00:02:23.170> enough<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.770> doing<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
thank you guys enough for doing that and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.390 
thank you guys enough for doing that and
continuing<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.080> do<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.410> because<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:27.160> growth

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
continuing to do that because the growth

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.280 
continuing to do that because the growth
has<00:02:27.640> not<00:02:27.700> stopped<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.660> launching

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
has not stopped it it's just launching

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.559 
has not stopped it it's just launching
upwards<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.010> onwards<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.670> there's<00:02:31.450> probably

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
upwards and onwards and there's probably

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.150 
upwards and onwards and there's probably
nothing<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.020> can<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.380> stop<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.709> unless<00:02:33.010> I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
nothing I can do to stop it unless I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.670 
nothing I can do to stop it unless I
suddenly<00:02:33.450> started<00:02:34.450> worshipping<00:02:35.020> Nazis<00:02:35.470> I
