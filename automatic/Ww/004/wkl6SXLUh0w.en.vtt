00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
for the henchman to jump down than it is

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
for the henchman to jump down than it is
for<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.229> climb<00:02:07.529> up<00:02:07.709> so<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
for them to climb up so if you see this

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.690

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
back up for now because that's a very

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.029 
back up for now because that's a very
noisy<00:04:44.509> takedown<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.259> glide<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:45.979> to

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
noisy takedown the glide it's going to

attract people very quickly to it so it
is<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.139> dangerous<00:04:48.530> tactic<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.070> use<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:49.490> it's

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.240 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's
also<00:04:49.729> a<00:04:49.880> very<00:04:50.060> effective<00:04:50.449> tactic<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.139> use<00:04:54.250> so

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
also a very effective tactic to use so

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
him and this again is not something

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.770 
him and this again is not something
that's<00:05:16.280> always<00:05:16.400> predictable<00:05:17.000> but<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.659> way

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
that's always predictable but the way

through means you constantly have to

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.490 
through means you constantly have to
adapt<00:05:21.349> your<00:05:21.440> tactics

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.220 

what<00:05:27.070> are<00:05:27.160> you<00:05:27.250> doing<00:05:27.670> need<00:05:27.970> help<00:05:28.210> you're<00:05:29.020> on

your own man rolls up James

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.260 
your own man rolls up James
suppose<00:05:33.100> they<00:05:33.220> get<00:05:33.310> more<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.610> more<00:05:33.670> terrified

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270
