00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.860
 yes friends today look sane regular 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:15.270
 bmx and according to preliminary estimates it 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:20.220
 falls into the shit category he stands 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:23.470
 13-15 thousand rubles is scott volt x20 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.099
 but unlike the same course, for the same 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.570
 money 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 he is not completely all high tons 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.370
 places to shoot for a specific son and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.810
 welcomed to walk a lot of different people 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.200
 in short here are two pipes of the temple 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.310
 Russian volitional cruise bar and while 0 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.430
 gram gram left connecting rod and otherwise 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.320
 everything is not very fun here two brakes 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.570
 which is not clear why we are needed here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.370
 front hub on balls normal 3 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.980
 elemental simple rods 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.520
 nice plastic pedals unlike 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.350
 cadet rear hub with driver and 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.810
 one bearing is sure I know about 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:15.240
 like our 2 regular classic callout 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.220
 the most comfortable grips is the protection of the chain 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 to your pants if you ride 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.890
 rap did not get there 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.870
 asterisk milled from three sides on 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 actually milling is so tricky 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.740
 stamping but she herself looks nicer 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.610
 than a star with no prizes at all 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 Well, the type as on the grinder was here next 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.210
 here is a combo saddle but it's not that horror and 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.190
 a nightmare that was still on the Cadets and 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 my on Holi on the subway were old combo 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.659
 all 2 hours are not others in general she 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.080
 soft comfortable and from that material 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.470
 which perfectly fixes pants 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 there are very strange tires on it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.900
 narrow and it is such poluslik more 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.900
 urban type 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.360
 wires can not say anything at a glance 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.930
 I will return except for a short time here the place is not 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.640
 there is a clumsy welding plan addition 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.470
 what's not on the very expensive line is all 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 there was a kerchief under the steering column 0 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.250
 integrated integrated clip 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.510
 no top feathers capture like 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 top tube but 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.380
 however, the pipe itself is variable 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.230
 forms she narrows here here 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.880
 increase it makes us think that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.560
 scott uses some kind of technology 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 its steel frames further here macro 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 huge dropouts with 2 pegs 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.700
 now they both moved back and lower 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.489
 feathers fasten carriages through fishbone 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.850
 if it is a diagnosis of such not too 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.480
 cool bmx and although if you compare with 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.250
 same cadet for the price then he is better in it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.550
 present and the usual any X 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.860
 ridiculousness well yes cheap type 14 axis 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.610
 it is not clear why in the middle of the hollow the same 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.000
 the very back she is nicholas but all this is not 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.160
 makes no difference because it's 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.959
 We will not be in the classical sense, you 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.500
 probably now what does this ahu 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.239
 Anton carries and that's what it is childish 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.870
 bike literally junie 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.250
 online 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.350
 so he positioned the site ie cat 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.620
 offers for children who can already 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.440
 ride two wheeled bikes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.630
 immediately change to this kind of bmx 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.549
 and despite the fact that by geometry you are the most 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.530
 ordinary classical geometry is simply not 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.580
 very high steering wheel in his little 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.920
 man high to anything 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.860
 This is by the way another item which 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.720
 I am very annoyed by modern 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.930
 at all 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.490
 industries this is how trends affect 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:03.220
 mass users because the guy is tall 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.560
 160 centimeters and less shoulder 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.170
 what i absolutely don't need root 9 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.940
 inches and 740 wide 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.550
 and such set because their favorite 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.120
 program skated with these hands is 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.269
 sad here such a mistake is not a shoe 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.220
 nothing is necessary and as a kid 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.880
 the bike he made is not that conscientious 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.760
 it's simple 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.060
 but it's very cool for the money you 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.400
 can buy some 24 mtb or 20 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.270
 just a children's bike 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.460
 which will not be with me so much 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.170
 cool for a child not for 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.790
 professional bmx free for who 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.620
 wants to start doing tricks and that's it 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.250
 for a child a child can on it 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.760
 ride jump and learn simple tricks 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.590
 because of his weight and skill 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.360
 unlikely to be enough to inflict 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.560
 this bike is so harmful that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.560
 then affect his health 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.080
 here and so friends here it differs 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.069
 bona fide brands from 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.389
 unscrupulous 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:12.080
 correct product positioning 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.190
 kids bike and bmx for stunt 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.470
 read the articles carefully friends do not 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.729
 fooled just its advertising doedu 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.729
 pass-pass, of course 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.930
 and I am more than sure that he will endure 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.440
 even some standard arsenal of tricks 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.880
 a child can on it you can on it 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.590
 learn something for sure and even 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.420
 something on it, I'll try to do a couple 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.590
 brakes are naturally understandable nothing 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.360
 because the child needs to slow down 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.010
 sorry for that word i like i didn't 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.920
 swear to congratulate the fact that it is possible 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.640
 watching parents maybe we feed 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.510
 and antifreeze sage ok let's get 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.510
 jump a little bit 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.319
 what 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.610
 point of view of tricks of course ride him 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.180
 the brake is not perfect right now 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.280
 narrow tires and these are stupid 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.860
 pegs put behind me that heel 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.810
 constantly hitting fire but the child 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.630
 can calmly without fear of learning 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.530
 him to do bonic he can if he 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.479
 persistent start doing mana and if something 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.580
 come up with brakes well at least with 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.479
 front and bar in pi here too 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.330
 do what fate is great at all 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:43.820
 pedals don't fall off like cheap 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.220
 bicycles it happens in general even 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.630
 Pants in the chain will not fall as a child 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.190
 the bike is just so well 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.810
 and one of the ideal options if u 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.050
 your child's extreme inclinations 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.180
 and even more so if he wants later 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.210
 collect from him a real bmx tricks 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.449
 rear wheel knock on at least 2 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.900
 ferries if you change the tire completely 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:09.530
 amiss rods also work needed 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:14.539
 there will be just another thick chain 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.669
 front wheel steering wheel and the frame itself 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.260
 that is, how would it be a bike for growth 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.690
 if you buy by example of you when 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.320
 completely out of the secret how cheap there 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.970
 bmx and and you have to change aging 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.669
 just all on it ate be shit 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.169
 done then on this bike all the same 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:34.529
 part of the money we later do not 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:37.979
 lose in general 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:41.999
 such are the things gentlemen it turns out that 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:45.539
 There are among and cheap bmx of even for 

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:49.529
 children are better models than supposedly 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:52.619
 jumps from other brands and what to buy 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:54.709
 it's up to you to decide all your friends 

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:54.709
 until 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.240
 so that
