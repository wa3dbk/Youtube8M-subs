00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 hello all here in the map rio 20 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 08 10 6 on the map with malek 72 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.670
 we will show you a second knife 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.869
 striking me exo survival so for that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.460
 we will go through the web breach of the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 ceiling by the aeration system which 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 is known in the iodine card 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 now and we made you a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 first video to get you a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.929
 first out of map now or done 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 a video to show you yesterday according to 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.890
 opta of map in exo mode sure you go 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.360
 turn around until you make sure 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.649
 a room with the data have if you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 fall besides you can consult 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 on nothing but from there you will do 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.059
 a double jump on the right and you 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 go where she shines at this door to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 right you go around 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.340
 because if you are on the second floor 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 of the prison 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.969
 you will go around like these 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.190
 is then tell you the first 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.020
 door we see here on the right a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 second door we do not see here is the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.199
 third door she admits could 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 lawal bretz you advance a little bit 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 in front of you and you will end up 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 below that opening where pulls 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.390
 precisely el malik 72 then you have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 two solutions the first is from 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.960
 do a double jump in front and there you 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 back off an empty 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.510
 and when you are up to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.310
 the kind of openness we have it's a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.689
 example to swim or second solution 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 you are jumping into the void for 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.830
 control with the exoplanet to advance 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 precisely in the opening but this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
 solution see walk here rather well we 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.759
 control better and we get into this 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 little piece here here with face texture 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.479
 to a transparent vision 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 so from there now to be 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.299
 officially the two matches must 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 go behind a fence for one hundred 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 will go under the map and come out with 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.479
 the exoplanet so we let ourselves down 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 here diagonally we move in the direction 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.110
 roasting in swimming example and have 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.850
 makes a double option to find yourself 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 behind fence and be so 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.740
 officially out of map in exo mode 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 survival for this second round of map 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 so then a little attention a little 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.030
 clear texture pot that are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.620
 behind you since actually he 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.710
 there are death zones you can 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.300
 however climb the stairs and then make a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.100
 half turn by the right here you go 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.670
 bypass the fence while remaining well 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.660
 sure the gray sidewalks part is here 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 otherwise if you are too much left you 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.860
 are going to fall to die you can do a 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.260
 double jump to cross a first 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 obstacle here transparent and you can 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
 find yourself even on the roof of the bus 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.530
 if you want and we finish the video 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 on the small roof we see in front here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.890
 little info the enemy who remain the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780
 enemies who will stay will not be able to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.300
 kill or will be invincible since the shots 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.190
 do not cross a fence so that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.410
 it's an info we have a little trick 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.910
 even interesting enough to finish the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.590
 video so we can go on this roof 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.030
 this is the second round of maps in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.840
 the yacht cartery in 1 08 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.840
 See you soon
