00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.109
 directly from san pedro nor be it for 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.240
 municipality of amecameca having thrown 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.130
 let's start with what is the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.599
 presentation of all the members to 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 see around here we start now that is 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.789
 sounding olive groves by the sight of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.789
 next vacation 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 Baptist I'm a vocalist also of the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 land 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.050
 you were 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.950
 ok we start this interview with some 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.660
 small some small questions with 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.180
 how long have you been on the ground 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.160
 dear how is it formed as already the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.020
 we know in these moments in fact the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.020
 band has been a year of experience 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 and what have been his presentations more 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.050
 significant so they have marked them 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.670
 they say in this we are going to this was the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 What we liked the most was the best appointment 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880
 all 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.450
 they 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.259
 Y 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.259
 yes 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.120
 to see what the rope here 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.470
 presentation that you have most called the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.220
 attention that was the best for 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.360
 you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.890
 Such is played on the dance made 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.510
 we are always passionate about this 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.960
 in any presentation of the best 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.500
 what 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.110
 that we have although I share here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.570
 and then I believe that all things 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.980
 meaningful 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.640
 the private ones we have presented 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.810
 at rodeo fairs events and I think the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.370
 acceptance of the people is what we 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.880
 is doing in fact it is very 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.980
 meaningful to me 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 ok another question I have them what 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.100
 it would be the band that they wanted 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.960
 touch or open an event that they say with 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 this is what we want and want to be 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.600
 or let your dream be like that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.290
 like all of us who are right now in the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.290
 I think that way 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.360
 when it's renowned that heads the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.280
 posters is not the dream of every band 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.650
 with us but it's not the same 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.530
 the motivation would be of the bend 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.370
 It has a 50 caliber 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.370
 cinnamon 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 one 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.370
 any reputable brand that 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.390
 let's open more 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.980
 Holy Land 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.739
 so the purpose 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.950
 This is touching the best 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.800
 meetings 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.630
 from that opportunity 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.630
 in fact I wanted to play with him 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.129
 some dates that have followed like this 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.319
 already come to the people who 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.700
 Follow us as we have now 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.319
 at least some dates on 11 the next 11 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.599
 October like being in the crazy choir 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.340
 let's be there be sharing the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.549
 stage with water tanks we are going to 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.739
 Also be in san marcos on day 12 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.690
 come late 14 the kings peace let's go 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.540
 wait for the 19th at the huacana in the mecca 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.269
 mecca we will be on 23 24 25 in san 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.239
 rafael with being on 26 in san juan de 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.700
 weeks pit lane on the 27th in that we're going to 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.209
 be on 28 in media centers gualco on 1 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.940
 and the 2 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.459
 be in halloween 2 and we wait for you 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.220
 another question so habitat that they mention 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.200
 the theme of what the crazy bull is 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.370
 it means for you to get here to a 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.859
 rodeo where many are presented 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.290
 many large groupings many like 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.150
 I mean big names here 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.810
 Much is more than anything because thanks to the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.549
 limitation that is the mad bull 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.560
 more than anything because there in those events 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.570
 they are already looking for bands that really are 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.060
 sounding at the moment they are looking for 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.620
 is in the taste of the people no more than 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.780
 nothing that thanks to the invitation to 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.970
 the best they are not doing because 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.699
 Maybe people also follow us so 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.770
 that we are, thank you 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.710
 now camps if for us good I think 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.740
 that encourages us to continue giving quality 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.509
 when the quality of the people and for 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.819
 we are a trampoline also the bull 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.710
 lonko well-known not only in the df 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.740
 but the surroundings is for us 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.599
 they are a springboard and you can take advantage 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.759
 maximum that opportunity that we are 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.949
 giving now to see here what is the 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.270
 meaning of the tournament these days 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.160
 with everything they have to see has 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.630
 name has 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.330
 It has mostly tracking 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.520
 inclusion in search of bands 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.880
 and I'm also after 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.650
 it's something and it's also very 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.010
 your lady sanitized more than the band of a 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.010
 step more 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.550
 first of all a greeting for the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:25.300
 compadre who gave the invitation as it is 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.710
 as a point says that since we are 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.430
 they are opening the doors that we have 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.430
 what to take advantage of 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.140
 and more to the people 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.110

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.550

 supporting from the first day I wanted 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.350

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.440
