00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.980
 I already have to go in the trailer 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.960
 check said that the idea is the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 Stripe is pretty blatant 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
 and very extreme I have it in advance 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.109
 seen and this is about the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.109
 church the purge 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.140
 Tonight, humans are allowed 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.000
 to break free 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.739
 of Aldingen oppressed have said the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.120
 The restrained violence they contain 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.780
 so you do not kill today too 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.470
 someone if i feel the need for it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.700
 feel 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.350
 do not forget how much good that 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:08.300
 Purification bring us to us 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:10.190
 nothing as usual no fear ok speak 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.630
 the emergency transmission system we 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.340
 announce the beginning of this year's 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.960
 perks of the purge 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.280
 when the siren sounds all 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 emergency services for twelve hours 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.250
 Deactivated your government thanks you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.250
 for your participation 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 why did you let us in her ? 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.040
 have no idea who is after him 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.710
 our goal this year is why 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.270
 hiding in her house they have 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 an hour to find him and us 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.020
 pass or we kill them alone 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 Can not get in here or the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.610
 can not come to our house 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.190
 we will survive this night and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.050
 then everything is back as it used to be 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.050
 ever again at present as before 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.810
 web page the purge goes 85 minutes 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.610
 starts on 13 july 2013 in germany 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.130
 wide and still has no finale 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.340
 age release but i type on fsk 16 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.410
 or fsk18 is bloodless the film 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.790
 at least not words that counts 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.459
 History of the United States of 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.850
 America in the near future more precisely 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.650
 in the year 2022 and the usa look at one 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.510
 past back with constantly 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.980
 growing crime rates and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.260
 overcrowded prisons until the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.330
 government on the idea comes a law 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.370
 to adopt the so-called patch set 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 that it allows the population one 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.850
 night to do for twelve hours a year 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.400
 and to leave whatever she wants 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.049
 including murder without being prosecuted 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.030
 to become for these twelve hours 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.190
 Close all police stations and also 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.930
 hospitals and then tells the film 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.880
 in particular the story of one 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.799
 man's name james ends the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.360
 safety equipment agent is on 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.040
 his area is one of the best and 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.690
 This pÃ¶tsch after the in the us 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.160
 is celebrated as it is christmas 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.780
 with his happy family 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.760
 wants to spend it secluded 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.440
 and from regulates to a man in front of his 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.079
 House turned up involuntarily 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.489
 take refuge with him and a group 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.260
 Of people who like this man 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.900
 want to murder for yourself 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.730
 clean that sounds all perfidious and 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.920
 it is too and gets a little bit like that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.959
 Panic room feeling in this right 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.519
 brutal thriller that promise 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.109
 stops if you see the trailer too 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.970
 really to redeem what he is 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.130
 seems and that is rare these days 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.480
 So who likes the trailer to the purchase 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.579
 should definitely watch the movie 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.500
 because the film offers what the trailer 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.420
 promises get with eastern squat on 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.130
 really not the main actor 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.989
 surprisingly good because he is easy 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.760
 good but this whole but also partially 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.140
 superficial topic with enough 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.600
 has supplied one 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.940
 wonderful antagonists than his 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.709
 towards the incredibly insane 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.990
 will and then in detail on each other 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.640
 meet many questions how far is going 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.590
 one to protect his family 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.810
 where does the dignity still place if 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.789
 you can murder legally and maybe has 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.370
 a legislation with a legal 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.900
 Valve to frustration and hurry up 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.630
 accumulated in the course of a year 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.700
 let out somehow one 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.530
 somehow a movie was the long 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.880
 so can discuss the two on 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.470
 even late in content 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.510
 is interesting and then especially with 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.070
 a brutality therefore comes the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.110
 looks handmade and rarely so 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.540
 is violent and therefore for all the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.400
 straight in the direction more brutal 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.900
 thriller movies really like each other 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.670
 should take a look at this 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.770
 i also believe that he is pretty much in the cinema 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.330
 will leave and especially in the home cinema 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.980
 get a whole lot of spectators 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.970
 at the moment there is not much pr 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.610
 around the strip 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.530
 He is really well done 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.330
 will not buy purchase otherwise film 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.560
 Maybe you just because 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.090
 It's like that if you train the two 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.920
 sees three times the stress out 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.870
 but look at this one is the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.460
 movie incredibly exciting and has with 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.960
 his 85 minutes also the right one 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.210
 length is not unnecessary 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.070
 longer but brings the story on 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.140
 the point from the first second on is 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.940
 the movie brutal provides us with the 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.680
 first second with a lot of recording 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.840
 the so-called patch events where people 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.520
 like to slaughter other people 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.450
 So friends who in the trailer buck 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.310
 should have the movie necessarily 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.960
 look well done too 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.060
 the kinoticket but should also something 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.040
 be boiled hard for so very easy is 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.570
 the film does not look like ethan hawke is 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.310
 really great all performers 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.590
 The underground is great 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.870
 is called by me as a brutal thriller 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.210
 gets ne pearc 8 out of 10 possible 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.340
 Totally worth seeing 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.690
 seven out of ten possible points like 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.460
