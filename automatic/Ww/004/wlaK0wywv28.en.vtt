00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.350 
from Taylor guitars which is a very
clever<00:02:23.470> idea<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.280> basically<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.180> has<00:02:25.209> a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
clever idea and basically it has a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.280 
clever idea and basically it has a
volume<00:02:25.569> control<00:02:26.580> built-in<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.050> end<00:02:29.200> of

the jack there so you plug into the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.250 
the jack there so you plug into the
strap<00:02:32.019> button<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:35.099> then<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.659> turn<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260

strap button and then you just turn the
pickup<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.010> off<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.430> control<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.359> volume
