is<00:02:14.459> always<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.030> hardest<00:02:15.450> group<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.989> replace

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
is always the hardest group to replace

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.380 
is always the hardest group to replace
for<00:02:16.650> any<00:02:16.769> program<00:02:17.280> let<00:02:17.489> alone<00:02:17.700> Florida<00:02:18.120> State

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
for any program let alone Florida State

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.089

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
and they've recruited extremely well

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.190 
and they've recruited extremely well
across<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.640> board<00:02:20.909> but<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.269> cannot<00:02:21.780> replace

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
across the board but you cannot replace

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.170 
across the board but you cannot replace
the<00:02:22.470> experience<00:02:23.040> factor<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.670> chemistry

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the experience factor in the chemistry

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.380 
the experience factor in the chemistry
that<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.420> lose<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.829> starters<00:02:26.430> depart<00:02:27.269> to
