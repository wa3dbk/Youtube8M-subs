00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 jaime that with zy this time we're going 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.130
 to talk about the 10 most famous monsters 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.290
 of universal and to have our list 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.889
 more complete we have a guest 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.929
 special 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.800
 pretty cross that is the new presenter 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 of study screen and universal 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980
 yes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.810
 ah 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.480
 the proven one of notre-dame 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.610
 in fact the character of quasimodo is 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.800
 considered as the first monster of 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.570
 universal and good I think we can 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.070
 understand why and what is very 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.410
 interesting is that changing who 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.350
 interpreted this character had to 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.100
 carry a hump that weighed in between 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 4.5 and 7 kilos the phantom of the opera ' 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 directed by rupert julen in 1925 the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.430
 main role was interpreted 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.809
 again for lon chaney that 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.750
 curiously he accepted a rope to the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.149
 nose to breathe a little the reaction 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.300
 and this caused him continuous injuries and 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.369
 constant bleeding and for 1989 the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.020
 actor Robert England best known for 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.670
 his role as freddy krueger played 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.130
 also the main character of both 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.870
 asthma of man 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.700
 frankenstein 1931 actually 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.950
 frankenstein is the name of its creator 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.710
 the french doctor this movie directed 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.690
 by james google in 1931 it was very 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 censored for several years to cesc in 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 those that were censored were given to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 know again the first one where 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 he showed me to the girl in 1986 and the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 scene where frankenstein compares 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.340
 with God was revealed in 1999 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.380
 dracula this character is a king of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.689
 film because there have been more than 200 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520
 adaptations about this character and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.979
 remember that it is based on the novel of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 bram stoker dracula and what is very 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 interesting is that even though now 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.549
 is very successful in its time it was not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.289
 made the writer had a hard time 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 and it was not until the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.580
 nosferatu movie without the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 authorization of the author that people 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.179
 he began to draw a lot of attention 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.140
 this story of dracula and it became 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.819
 all a success the invisible man the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.409
 study and universal pretended that boris 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.090
 karloff bacon and kobori carlos 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.910
 will play this main character 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.500
 but the actor refused to participate given 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.269
 that his face would appear only at 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.700
 end of the movie and pretended 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.360
 pay you a very minor amount for your 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 participation 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.440
 Frankenstein's girlfriend and as well as her 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.990
 boyfriend to this movie they censored her 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.360
 quite a lot also qualified the doctor 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.340
 of homosexual said that the way in which 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.250
 frankenstein looked at the body of his 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870
 half-dead bride was necrophilia and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.080
 they also believed that the neckline of the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 actress revealed much more than what a 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.099
 dead has to reveal 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.720
 the man after london a failure in 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.040
 box office because in spite of being a 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.770
 original story had many 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.560
 similarities with doctor jay contrary 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.420
 the werewolf the actor long chain and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.450
 junior was the one who was responsible for giving 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.450
 life to this super monster who does not 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.180
 it took thousands and thousands and thousands of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.070
 animal hair and buy or power 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.080
 get into the body of this character 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.940
 that in fact it is very interesting that your 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.660
 real story is based on experience 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.640
 of the writer in Nazi Germany on how 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.100
 a man can become a 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.580
 beast a ticket to be from sea and already 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.580
 it is not 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.739
 the mummy this was indeed the first 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.050
 original story of the universal since 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.790
 it was not based on any book but 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.129
 that was based on the real facts of the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.849
 opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.620
 1922 the monster of the black lagoon 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.239
 Legend has it that the cinematographer 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.069
 mexican gabriel figueroa in 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.590
 conversations with producer william 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.090
 German commented about a myth about 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.440
 a humanoid that lived in South America 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.060
 so the producer took these 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.290
 elements with Mixed 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.940
 beauty and the beast 'to create this 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.950
 history the monster of the black lagoon 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.319
 has inspired numerous comics and others 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.690

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.970
