 we can apply to horses and also 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 we can apply human beings as rajoy 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.410

 a continuous daily intake and with 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.000
 motivation life expectancy of a 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.670
 horse that we can start 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.460
 train us and what is the adult age of 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.910
 a horse in these specifically horses 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.010
 of Spanish from 4 years 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.530
 there are English or more premature horses 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.810
 that starts with them before both 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.500
 years to a year and a half depending on what 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.800
 discipline and then they have good 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.090
 conditions between 20 and 25 years 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.930

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.140
 close-up of that little white horse 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.269
