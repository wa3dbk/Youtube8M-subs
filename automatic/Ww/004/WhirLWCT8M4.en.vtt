here<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> 1dx<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> 1dx<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
here with the 1dx now I like the 1dx a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
here with the 1dx now I like the 1dx a
lot<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> 1dx<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.369> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
lot I like the 1dx for a lot of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.830 
lot I like the 1dx for a lot of
different<00:02:05.759> reasons<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.689> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
different reasons but I think it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
different reasons but I think it's
really<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.500> sports<00:02:07.890> shooter<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
really your sports shooter and the
