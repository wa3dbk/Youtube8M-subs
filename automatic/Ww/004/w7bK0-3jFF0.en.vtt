00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.330
 butterfly cookies in lhasa 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.960
 forgive the voice but I'm something 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 cold 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.100
 let's start making the cookies and 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.230
 for that we have to sift first 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.990
 all the icing sugar that of any 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.410
 small group equally sieve we will do all the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.410
 flour 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.060
 we throw the butter to the bowl that has 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.410
 to be at room temperature and 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 we begin to mix with the shovel 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.950
 mixer 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 We are adding the icing sugar and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.589
 sifted spoonfuls and without 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.589
 stop beating 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.579
 until all are mixed by 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.859
 full 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.750
 on the other hand we beat the egg a little and 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.699
 we add it to the previous 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.120
 We also take the essence of vanilla or 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 the vanilla pasta mixes everything now 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.299
 We start by throwing the sifted flour 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 same 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.070
 gradually scoop scoops 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.030
 when we have almost finished 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.300
 all the flour we will throw a little 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.130
 milk one or two teaspoons until 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.070
 let's see that the mass is integrated and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.260
 begins to separate from the walls 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.200
 then we pass the dough to the table over 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.450
 baking paper we make a little ball with 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 she and we split it into four pieces 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.620
 and now we start to stretch each 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.530
 little piece that we have cut 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.570
 putting it on two baking paper and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.210
 passing it with a roller we are putting 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 one on top of the other to save it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.650
 then well in the fridge a day 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.050
 next one time completely cold 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.480
 We are cutting each cookie with the mold 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.640
 that we have chosen in my case will be 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.500
 butterflies we are putting them on the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 tray that we are going to bake with 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 careful not to break them 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.709
 once they are cut we go back to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.140
 pass it to the refrigerator for at least 15 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.450
 minutes before passing it to the oven and 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.610
 bake we have 180 degrees with heat 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.100
 up and down until the edges 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.200
 start to brown, do not let it pass anymore 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.819
 time because if you do not burn time 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.459
 It depends on the oven but my oven has 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.230
 been 13 minutes exact we put it in 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.840
 a grate to cool down and a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.870
 Once cold we keep them somewhere 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.580
 tight and at least one day before 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.890
 when we want to decorate we prepare them 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.270
 the class mixing the icing sugar 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.970
 sieved with powdered albumin 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.280
 and a little bit of water the water you have to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 throw it very little by little and without leaving 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.110
 to beat at low speed 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.820
 at the beginning it will appear to be a mass 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 that does not integrate but leaving time 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.550
 exact will be perfect once the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.980
 we keep the tapes and that the paper 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.870
 transparent touch with the grease so that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.390
 do not dry, you have to leave everything well 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.940
 lined before putting it in the fridge and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 we will leave it there to rest at least one day 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.290
 Ideally, there should be at least two 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.770
 because that way the fat will be left after more 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.770
 sparkly 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.900
 with everything ready we only have to 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.540
 decorate this and it will suit everyone 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.549
 the ways of decorating and how I have 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.160
 prepared the fat that is all in the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.290
 Blog 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.280
 how have these been for my birthday? 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 niece I've left them that beautiful 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.630
 but I have to say that they were not only 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.870
 beautiful they were very good and there was not even 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.870
 a 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.850
 enjoy it
