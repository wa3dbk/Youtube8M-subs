cooler it's a lot less complicated it's

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.930 
cooler it's a lot less complicated it's
gonna<00:00:25.900> be

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.090 

you<00:00:31.600> can<00:00:31.810> see<00:00:32.050> that<00:00:32.260> the<00:00:32.350> wiring<00:00:32.740> is<00:00:32.830> going<00:00:33.010> to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
you can see that the wiring is going to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.760 
you can see that the wiring is going to
be<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.250> bit<00:00:33.460> of<00:00:33.490> a<00:00:33.640> headache<00:00:33.880> but<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:35.350> think<00:00:35.680> I'm

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
be a bit of a headache but I think I'm

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.680 
be a bit of a headache but I think I'm
sorted<00:00:36.430> when<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:36.700> get<00:00:36.850> all<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.510> moment

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
sorted when you get all for the moment

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.230 
sorted when you get all for the moment
we<00:00:37.990> hooked<00:00:38.560> up<00:00:38.740> with<00:00:39.250> your<00:00:39.550> respective<00:00:40.060> my

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
we hooked up with your respective my

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.740 
we hooked up with your respective my
expertise<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.280> run<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.940> cabling<00:00:43.330> line<00:00:43.600> up

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
expertise to run the cabling line up

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.200 
expertise to run the cabling line up
those<00:00:43.960> get<00:00:44.830> things<00:00:45.040> set<00:00:45.340> up<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:45.700> ideally<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.180> a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
those get things set up so ideally is a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.299 
those get things set up so ideally is a
wiring<00:00:46.570> harness<00:00:47.050> two<00:00:47.739> pairs<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.070> wiring

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
wiring harness two pairs of wiring

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.580 
wiring harness two pairs of wiring
harnesses<00:00:48.700> one<00:00:49.090> on<00:00:49.239> each<00:00:49.360> side<00:00:49.390> left<00:00:50.200> or<00:00:50.350> right

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
harnesses one on each side left or right

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.890 
harnesses one on each side left or right
and<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:51.940> over<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.330> other<00:00:52.480> right<00:00:52.720> down

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
and so as over the other right down

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.430 
and so as over the other right down
towards<00:00:53.080> my<00:00:53.470> Z<00:00:54.190> tower

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.610 

right<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.030> think<00:00:59.230> it's<00:01:00.230> kind<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.410> clear

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
right and so I think it's kind of clear

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.090 
right and so I think it's kind of clear
out<00:01:00.649> there

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
out there

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.899 
out there
and<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.670> can<00:01:01.910> see<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.920> threaded

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
and you can see the the threaded

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.630 
and you can see the the threaded
thermistor<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.630> sitting<00:01:06.229> out<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> side<00:01:06.680> their

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.510 

connectors<00:01:10.640> for<00:01:10.850> them<00:01:11.030> anyway<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:12.460> now<00:01:13.460> I

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
connectors for them anyway right now I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.789 
connectors for them anyway right now I
have<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.970> other<00:01:14.000> three<00:01:14.390> hot<00:01:14.659> hands<00:01:14.869> raised<00:01:15.530> up

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
have the other three hot hands raised up

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.899 
have the other three hot hands raised up
off<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.040> via

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.310 

forget<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:19.940> little<00:01:20.119> bit<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.720> they<00:01:20.840> don't<00:01:21.020> rub

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
forget a little bit so they don't rub

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.450 
forget a little bit so they don't rub
into<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.130> bars<00:01:22.340> uprights<00:01:22.850> me<00:01:23.979> next<00:01:24.979> step<00:01:25.250> I'll

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
into the bars uprights me next step I'll

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.249 
into the bars uprights me next step I'll
go<00:01:25.670> ahead<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.090> calibrate<00:01:26.570> proving<00:01:27.170> easy

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
go ahead and calibrate proving easy

go ahead and calibrate proving easy
Heights<00:01:27.680> all<00:01:27.950> four<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.340> those<00:01:28.610> even<00:01:29.090> though

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
Heights all four of those even though

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.790 
Heights all four of those even though
they<00:01:29.360> looked<00:01:29.720> up<00:01:29.869> just<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.259> see<00:01:30.470> how<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.649> goes

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
they looked up just to see how that goes

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.180 
they looked up just to see how that goes
and<00:01:31.479> I've<00:01:32.479> already<00:01:32.600> got<00:01:32.840> my<00:01:33.050> second<00:01:33.530> extruder

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
and I've already got my second extruder
