00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:10.559
 ex-playmate explains the end of the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.990
 plastic bag what brings us the eu and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.280
 what are they doing there? 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 for example, they bring environmental protection 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 Advance and bring the plastic bag 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.340
 hopefully an early end 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 But let's start all of the above 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.280
 We often encounter plastic bags 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 everyday life 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.360
 We get them in the supermarket either 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 Free in the fruit and 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.530
 vegetable department or buy at the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.230
 cash register 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.520
 this means that around 100 people come to europe every year 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 billion plastic bags together 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 a portuguese uses for example in the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 averaged 500 pieces annually 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 German 64 pieces 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.410
 The Danes are the trailblazers they need 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 only four are used once and that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.470
 an average of 25 minutes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.309
 short time considering that the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.520
 nature 100 to 500 years is needed for her 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.409
 to digest 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.899
 The plastic does not degrade at all 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.350
 but breaks down into smaller and smaller parts 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.369
 and ends up as a grain of sand at the end 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.369
 beaches of this world 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.039
 or the bags gather in the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.110
 Pacific Ocean there is a huge swimming 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.070
 plastic carpet four times as big as 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.289
 Germany 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.750
 but not only in the water you will find the 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.479
 bags again but also in the stomachs 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.299
 from fishing sea ​​birds and others 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.460
 marine animals or the animals caught 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.420
 yourself in the bags and can not 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.049
 free more 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.000
 both often leads to death nor to 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.100
 plastic bags a gigantic 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.450
 Waste of resources a bag 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.189
 needs 40 grams of petroleum 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.340
 that's all for the eu commission 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.009
 Reason enough until 2019 the enormous 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.439
 consumption of plastic bags here are the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.759
 Free meant for fruits and vegetables 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.269
 in europe by 80 percent 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.519
 Member States may themselves 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.459
 Decide if you are over consumption 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.410
 fees national prohibitions or taxes 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.599
 rules in Denmark and Ireland could do so 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.880
 the per capita consumption significantly lowered 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.760
 become 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.489
 but the claim will only be law if 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.239
 all 28 european governments 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.400
 agree 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.980
 but each one of us can already today 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 this will start the plastic bags of this 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.690
 world to announce the fight 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.790
 because there are also alternatives though 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.459
 beware of biodegradable 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.329
 Unfortunately, plastic bags do not hold anything 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.819
 they promise 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.700
 better types are made of recycled 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.500
 Paper thanks to its shorter weathering 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.859
 time they are far less problematic 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.720
 for the environment but not quite so 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.739
 tear-resistant to place one therefore stand 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.870
 durable cloth bags 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.319
 cotton hemp or jute for you 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.639
 consist of renewable resources 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.620
 and if then still on their 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.510
 organic farming and fair trade 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.909
 is respected 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.260
 stands the plastic bags free future 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.260
 nothing in the way
