00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.610
 good afternoon my name is kirill umrikhin i 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.350
 I am a professional photographer in 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.070
 extreme sports and travel 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.139
 Photo 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.790
 Today we will talk about what 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.299
 I use my technique 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:25.449
 trips 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:27.670
 let's go start preparing for the next 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.779
 travel, I choose the photographic 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.240
 which I will take with me 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.220
 if we are talking about a trip to the ocean 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.199
 the most important thing is a big telephoto lens 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.090
 for shooting from the shore and underwater box for 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.950
 shooting out of the water if we are talking about 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.360
 a trip to the mountains is the most important factor 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.129
 this is the weight of the equipment 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.780
 if you take heavy photo equipment you 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.090
 just can't get to the right place 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.010
 and remain without a frame I suggest to go 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 specifics and take a look at the example of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 what I got from my photo backpacks 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.059
 the main thing for the photographer is his work 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.340
 camera tool and lenses 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.579
 I use two cameras with camera work 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.440
 nikon d4 is a quick-fire not killed 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.149
 highly professional cameras I'm with this 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.250
 We have experienced a lot of cameras together. 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.200
 jumped from huge waves and carrion from 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.970
 and 7 meters she was in the snow was in 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.920
 salty spray of water but nonetheless she 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.810
 runs smoothly its main 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.940
 advantage is the rate of fire 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.399
 and is full of the dimension of the matrix that is, you 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.259
 have 12 frames per second and good 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.390
 quality resolution and so are you 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.399
 use the entire lens area and not 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.009
 only its central part as matrices 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.110
 smaller format besides d4 i use 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.229
 camera model nikon d800 which 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.660
 possess a huge matrix and about when shooting 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.300
 for example out of water you can trim 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.899
 image tripled and receive quality 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.119
 available for printing for exhibitions and for 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.160
 publications this camera has a smaller 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.569
 shooting speed of 5 frames per second 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.550
 nevertheless it is enough for 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.140
 shooting sports as well as this camera 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.610
 use for shooting with flashes about 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.979
 which I will tell you later 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.929
 one word camera nikon d800 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.729
 used by me for shooting surfing 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.610
 for shooting landscapes or shooting 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.289
 highly artistic photos 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.300
 ad4 is a workhorse that 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.039
 speeds of 12 frames per second takes 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.290
 perfect reporting works on 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.280
 competitions and brings the most difficult 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.280
 difficulties for months 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.650
 now let's move to the lens unfortunately 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.910
 traveling is not always possible 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.130
 use lenses with fixed 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.620
 focal length which give 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.540
 perfect picture with a nice blur 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.820
 good sharpness i use a few 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.190
 lens trip is my favorite lens 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.440
 It can not 70200 in which there is a good 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.110
 stabilizer as well as excellent luminosity 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 2 and 8 this lens always travels. 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.130
 with me and irreplaceable in all situations 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.870
 both in winter and on the ocean he has 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.940
 perfect focal length for both 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.000
 shooting sports so for a portrait he doesn't 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.650
 heavy excellent luminous 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.470
 unkillable it goes well with 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.390
 extender does not wash sharp and he 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 beautiful tank lens 2470 fit in 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.470
 mainly for shooting reports i 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.209
 I use indoors during 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.980
 rewards with him can be removed as 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.380
 beautiful portrait and wide angle 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.510
 plan from all over the award zone to me 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.510
 like to take it and use the shooting 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.340
 of nature on nikon d800 this lens i 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.080
 I use for artistic shooting for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.030
 shooting landscapes sometimes for shooting 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.250
 portraits i like it blur me 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.769
 like his sharpness his weight he 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 50 perfect travel lens 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.440
 millimeters 14 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.030
 This is a standard portrait lens. 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.530
 who use when shooting 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.269
 athletes or 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.489
 sometimes I use for evening shooting 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.800
 when i need to put a smaller one 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.930
 exposure and aperture plays an important role 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.940
 for many types of extreme shooting 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.519
 use usa and i really like this 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.840
 lens for its creative component 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.370
 most often i use eat for 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.019
 underwater shooting i insert it in 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.000
 underwater boxing and it gives me 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.500
 possibility of combinations with nikon d800 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.390
 be close enough to 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.130
 athlete and make interesting shots with 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.230
 facial expression with emotions 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.230
 and also be in the thick of the wave 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.270
 I like to shoot portraits not only with 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.250
 natural light but using 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.380
 artificial lights nozzles for this 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.240
 I use as a generator for the flash and 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.590
 ordinary flashes on cameras such as 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.770
 nikon sb-910 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.370
 to connect the flashes from the camera I use 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.840
 radio synchronizers that give me 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 opportunity to leave more 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.250
 100 meters and allow you to choose any 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.630
 an angle which is interesting to me mainly 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.060
 artificial light i use for 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.120
 shooting portraits of athletes either for 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.900
 shooting cycling skateboarding or 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.090
 snowboard 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.490
 it gives me the opportunity to not depend on it 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.840
 natural color and highlight 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.150
 some place to ride or 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.340
 emphasizes the athlete himself during 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.460
 the stunt flash performance is very good 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.950
 freezes the moment and shows the apotheosis 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.510
 challenging stunt and athlete like it 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.700
 and the magazine likes the result 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.160
 the only disadvantage of working with flashes 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.520
 it you must learn to do good 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.650
 frame 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.020
 one frame and not a series, that is to say 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.000
 nikon d4 camera which shoots 12 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.010
 frames per second in me will help you 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 you need to learn how to accurately catch the apotheosis 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.180
 trick to accurately catch the right moment 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.540
 often it is very difficult especially in 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.540
 cycling 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.710
 and the final part we will talk about 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.140
 My latest passion is photography with 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.790
 by air just recently for simple 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.920
 user drones become available 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.350
 allowing to raise the camera to a height 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.990
 it gives hitherto unknown angles 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.390
 which you can get when shooting 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.490
 snowboard when shooting wakeboard surfing 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.020
 no matter what species before us 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.730
 I had to rent a helicopter 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.500
 it is very expensive 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.240
 prepare to get many permissions 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.040
 now you are just rising small 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.350
 drone in the air and doing those shots that 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.390
 you conceived shooting from the air expands 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.190
 horizons in creativity and also gives 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.190
 new opportunities when shooting sports 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.080
 Well, we talked about that photographic equipment 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.300
 which uses rides whether mountains 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.890
 and ocean or aerial photography in order 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.080
 to make a beautiful frame you need 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.900
 dream of traveling and of course 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.670
 More pictures of try to do 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.270
 and try with you was Kirill Umrikhin 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.270
 I'll see you
