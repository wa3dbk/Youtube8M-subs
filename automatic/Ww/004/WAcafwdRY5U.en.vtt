cell<00:00:03.389> nuclear<00:00:03.659> transfer<00:00:04.110> so<00:00:05.040> conceptually

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
cell nuclear transfer so conceptually

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.670 
cell nuclear transfer so conceptually
straightforward<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.930> method<00:00:07.230> itself<00:00:07.350> is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
straightforward the method itself is

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.310 
straightforward the method itself is
very<00:00:07.980> difficult<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.760> simply<00:00:09.690> take<00:00:09.960> an<00:00:10.139> egg

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
very difficult you simply take an egg

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.680 
very difficult you simply take an egg
and<00:00:11.010> at<00:00:11.190> our<00:00:11.309> site<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.090> remove<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and at our site and you remove the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.609 
and at our site and you remove the
nucleus<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.790> then<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
nucleus and then you do this for a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.310 
nucleus and then you do this for a
number<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> different<00:00:17.250> eggs<00:00:17.600> you<00:00:18.600> isolate

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
number of different eggs you isolate

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.099 
number of different eggs you isolate
nuclei<00:00:19.650> from<00:00:19.920> adult<00:00:20.910> cells<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.600> then<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
nuclei from adult cells and then you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
nuclei from adult cells and then you
transfer<00:00:22.560> those<00:00:22.680> nucleotides<00:00:23.490> back<00:00:23.730> into<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
transfer those nucleotides back into the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
transfer those nucleotides back into the
oocyte<00:00:24.920> whatever's<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> oh<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> site<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
oocyte whatever's in the oh a site the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.169 
oocyte whatever's in the oh a site the
factors<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> oocytes<00:00:28.050> somehow<00:00:28.740> induce

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
factors in the oocytes somehow induce

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.110 
factors in the oocytes somehow induce
this<00:00:30.179> adult<00:00:30.660> nucleus<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.880> open<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.000> its

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this adult nucleus to open up its

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
this adult nucleus to open up its
potential<00:00:33.690> again<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.290> following<00:00:34.680> chance<00:00:35.010> with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
potential again so following chance with

the<00:00:35.280> nucleus<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> OA<00:00:36.300> site<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.840> allow<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the nucleus into the OA site we allow it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.310 
the nucleus into the OA site we allow it
to<00:00:37.380> develop<00:00:37.550> for<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.879> few<00:00:39.149> days<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> mouse<00:00:39.930> 3

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to develop for a few days in the mouse 3

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
to develop for a few days in the mouse 3
days<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> human<00:00:41.309> 5<00:00:41.579> days<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
days and in the human 5 days and at that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.139 
days and in the human 5 days and at that
point<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.559> put<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> culture<00:00:44.460> dish<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
point we put it in a culture dish and we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
point we put it in a culture dish and we
derived<00:00:45.930> an<00:00:46.170> embryonic<00:00:46.440> stem<00:00:46.710> cells<00:00:46.950> however

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
derived an embryonic stem cells however

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.619 
derived an embryonic stem cells however
had<00:00:47.789> certainly<00:00:48.090> been<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.570> difficult

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
had certainly been much more difficult

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.560 
had certainly been much more difficult
in<00:00:49.230> human<00:00:49.649> technically<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> SC<00:00:51.360> NT

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
in human technically to do the SC NT

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
in human technically to do the SC NT
process<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> hasn't<00:00:52.500> been<00:00:52.770> successful

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
process and it hasn't been successful

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880 
process and it hasn't been successful
yet<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.090> recently<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.899> successful<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
yet it recently was successful in the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.250 
yet it recently was successful in the
rhesus<00:00:56.219> monkey<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:57.449> closely<00:00:57.960> related

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
rhesus monkey more closely related

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
rhesus monkey more closely related
species<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.949> human<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> mouse<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.000> course

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
species to human and mouse of course

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.349 
species to human and mouse of course
yeah<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.620> involved<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.010> SMT<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
yeah so I got involved in SMT as a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.840 
yeah so I got involved in SMT as a
postdoctoral<00:01:03.870> fellow<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.670> got

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
postdoctoral fellow and what really got

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.520 
postdoctoral fellow and what really got
me<00:01:05.970> excited<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> method<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.320> was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
me excited about the method is there was

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
me excited about the method is there was
a<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.770> new<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> novel<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> study<00:01:09.510> both

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a really new and novel way to study both

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
a really new and novel way to study both
biology<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.710> disease<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.850> allowed<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
biology and disease it allowed one to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.190 
biology and disease it allowed one to
take<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> fully<00:01:14.340> differentiated<00:01:14.850> cell<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> D

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
take the fully differentiated cell and D

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
take the fully differentiated cell and D
differentiated<00:01:16.830> embryonic<00:01:17.250> cell<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
differentiated embryonic cell and that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
differentiated embryonic cell and that
allows<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.869> ask<00:01:19.049> many<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.680> critical

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
allows you ask many really critical

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
allows you ask many really critical
questions<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:21.030> happens<00:01:21.720> when<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.170> from

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
questions what happens when you go from

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
questions what happens when you go from
a<00:01:22.439> D<00:01:22.560> differentiation<00:01:23.220> yeah<00:01:24.090> early<00:01:24.840> embryonic

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
a D differentiation yeah early embryonic

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440 
a D differentiation yeah early embryonic
cell<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> full<00:01:25.950> adult<00:01:26.220> cell<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.330> in

cell to a full adult cell by going in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020 
cell to a full adult cell by going in
Reverse<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> undo<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.799> process<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> we

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
Reverse we can undo that process and we

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.670 
Reverse we can undo that process and we
do<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> process<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.049> understand

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
do that process and really understand

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
do that process and really understand
the<00:01:31.770> process<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.759> hope<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.210> eventually

the process with hope of that eventually

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
the process with hope of that eventually
down<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> road<00:01:34.049> we'll<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.229> able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> repeat

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
down the road we'll be able to repeat

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
down the road we'll be able to repeat
that<00:01:35.310> process<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> culture<00:01:36.240> dish<00:01:36.270> turn

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of course which is one of the major

promise of regenerative medicine so a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.800 
promise of regenerative medicine so a

hope with SC NT and other methods of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
hope with SC NT and other methods of
reprogramming<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:47.460> produce<00:01:47.880> an

reprogramming is will produce an

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.850 
reprogramming is will produce an
embryonic<00:01:48.479> stem<00:01:48.509> cell<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:49.229> completely<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
embryonic stem cell that's completely a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
embryonic stem cell that's completely a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
match to that patient genetically and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.679

then<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.159> ES<00:01:53.430> cells<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> potential

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
then these ES cells have the potential

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
then these ES cells have the potential
to<00:01:54.960> produce<00:01:55.320> every<00:01:55.710> cell<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> body<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.850> as

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to produce every cell in the body so as

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.170 
to produce every cell in the body so as
we<00:01:57.090> learn<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> tap<00:01:58.079> into<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> potential

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
we learn to tap into that potential

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.550 
we learn to tap into that potential
differentiate<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.299> any<00:02:00.420> cell<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
differentiate in any cell we want and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
differentiate in any cell we want and
Transplant<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.340> back<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> patient<00:02:03.240> we

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
Transplant it back in the patient we

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
Transplant it back in the patient we
should<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.110> Dave<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> same<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.820> be

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
should be Dave to do the same it will be

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.100 
should be Dave to do the same it will be
the<00:02:06.000> same<00:02:06.149> concept<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.719> current<00:02:07.020> day

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

transplants<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.700> cells<00:02:09.060> matched

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

transplants but now with cells matched
to<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> patient<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.120> from<00:02:12.599> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to that patient so I think from a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
to that patient so I think from a
standpoint<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.500> Reed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739

damaged tissue there's real promise real
great<00:02:16.950> promise<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.549> I've<00:02:18.030> been<00:02:18.209> doing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
great promise here I've been doing

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.660 
great promise here I've been doing
biology<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.079> about<00:02:19.230> 15<00:02:19.560> years<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.010> there's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
biology for about 15 years and there's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.149 
biology for about 15 years and there's
no<00:02:20.760> question<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.420> speed<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.890> field

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
no question that the speed of the field

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.589 
no question that the speed of the field
in<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> last<00:02:23.519> five<00:02:23.819> years<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.299> just<00:02:24.329> a

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
in the last five years is just a

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.149 
in the last five years is just a
tremendous<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> compare<00:02:25.829> it<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> any

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
tremendous when you compare it to any

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.699 
tremendous when you compare it to any
field<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:26.730> science<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.810> been<00:02:27.989> very

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
field in science and it's just been very

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.399 
field in science and it's just been very
rapid<00:02:29.250> progress<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:31.049> fact<00:02:31.290> we

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
rapid progress it's just the fact we

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.259 
rapid progress it's just the fact we
could<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.099> shocking<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
could do it was shocking and then that

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.170 
could do it was shocking and then that
leads<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> progression<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.650> science<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.760> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
leads to the progression of science so I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.420 
leads to the progression of science so I
think<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.690> goal<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.260> SMT<00:02:37.680> has<00:02:37.860> always<00:02:38.040> been

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
think the goal with SMT has always been

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.050 
think the goal with SMT has always been
to<00:02:38.760> figure<00:02:39.060> out<00:02:39.739> what<00:02:40.739> about<00:02:41.129> SN<00:02:41.489> T<00:02:41.609> what<00:02:41.819> about

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to figure out what about SN T what about

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.660 
to figure out what about SN T what about
this<00:02:42.530> technique<00:02:43.530> allow<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.010> cells<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> D

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
this technique allow the cells to D

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.580 
this technique allow the cells to D
differentiate<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.420> once<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.810> how<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.290> do

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
differentiate and once we know how to do

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.319 
differentiate and once we know how to do
that<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.370> certainly<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:47.970> we'll<00:02:48.150> move

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
that then I certainly think we'll move

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.970 
that then I certainly think we'll move
into<00:02:48.629> actually<00:02:49.079> doing<00:02:49.319> directly

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
into actually doing directly

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.099 
into actually doing directly
manipulating<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.790> cells<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.269> bypassing<00:02:51.900> s

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
manipulating the cells and bypassing s

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.349 
manipulating the cells and bypassing s
ent<00:02:52.500> altogether<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:54.060> think<00:02:54.180> we're<00:02:54.269> there

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
ent altogether I don't think we're there

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.059 
ent altogether I don't think we're there
yet<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.500> you're<00:02:55.620> certainly<00:02:55.859> getting

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
yet but when you're certainly getting
