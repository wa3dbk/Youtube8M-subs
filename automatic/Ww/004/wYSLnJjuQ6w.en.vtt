00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.470
 Do you know what it is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.610
 gardening is really my pleasure and my 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 life 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.769
 I already work in the garden six days a week 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 so yes when I am home once and it 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.019
 is nice weather 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 I don't feel like mowing it's raining 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.699
 I don't feel like making that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 I have a new best friend 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 new ones 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 that is a robotic lawnmower saw him for a while 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.980
 slide behind me and that is really possible 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.560
 every corner of your healthy garden 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 who can handle that whatever it looks like 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.800
 right with obstacles it doesn't matter 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 bump into a tree that goes for a while 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 back again and happily continues 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
 in addition to being able to set up like you 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.880
 want to have 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.950
 let William make jobs, you can 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040
 william random just completely criss-cross 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.660
 You can also let it go through your garden 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.030
 leave William on three days a week 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 you can adjust mowing you can adjust the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.460
 hours setting can even set where 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.320
 a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 do not want to make now can also 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.560
 you too 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.230
 slopes up to 25 degrees 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.260
 minimal and even then it remains too 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.240
 just pack the hell right he dive 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.790
 who down no he corrects 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 every time making it nice and tight 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.390
 that part in him I just briefly 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.010
 because what is very special is that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 the bottom of the robot mower it 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.610
 cutter is provided with a number 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.060
 slots we have three holes in that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.560
 disk and which provide a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.450
 air circulation 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 those three holes that create one 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.159
 swirl and even with some damp there 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.840
 again you pull that grass up a little and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.860
 also cut the table through the circulation 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.590
 the shreds are spread nicely 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.100
 In addition you hear and her cup is put 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.850
 there is a security on a pin code 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.850
 who only knows you 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.360
 so 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.520
 it does it again and when the battery is empty 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.980
 then he automatically goes to it 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.740
 Charging station allows us people and goes 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.970
 the by work i'm a bit ready 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.700

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.990
 I happen to have tips for Italy 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.230
