00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
some of the gear VR games can only be

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.249 
some of the gear VR games can only be
played<00:00:27.099> with<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.369> gamepad<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.539> gamepad<00:00:28.960> is

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
played with the gamepad the gamepad is

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.820 
played with the gamepad the gamepad is
sold<00:00:29.650> separately<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.250> believe<00:00:30.640> it's<00:00:30.810> $39<00:00:31.810> I<00:00:32.169> got

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
sold separately I believe it's $39 I got

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.049 
sold separately I believe it's $39 I got
over<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.040> first<00:00:33.309> came<00:00:33.489> out<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:33.850> think<00:00:33.970> I

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
over the first came out so I think I

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.200 
over the first came out so I think I
paid<00:00:34.269> more<00:00:34.480> for<00:00:34.540> it<00:00:34.960> but<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.820> can't<00:00:37.059> operate

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
paid more for it but you can't operate

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.119 
paid more for it but you can't operate
it<00:00:37.510> outside<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.989> gear<00:00:38.170> VR<00:00:38.199> so<00:00:38.710> that's<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:38.949> fun

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
it outside the gear VR so that's the fun

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.009 
it outside the gear VR so that's the fun
part<00:00:39.159> you<00:00:39.489> can<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.790> know<00:00:39.940> play<00:00:40.420> emulators

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
part you can you know play emulators

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.270 
part you can you know play emulators
with<00:00:41.229> it<00:00:41.350> play<00:00:41.559> lots<00:00:41.769> of<00:00:41.860> different<00:00:42.129> stuff

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
with it play lots of different stuff

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.549 
with it play lots of different stuff
with<00:00:42.339> it<00:00:42.610> but<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.390> game<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.750> does<00:00:43.869> require<00:00:44.199> it

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
with it but this game it does require it

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.619 
with it but this game it does require it
so<00:00:44.799> as<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.100> see<00:00:45.309> on<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.460> bottom<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:46.299> says<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
so as you see on the bottom it says the

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.509 
so as you see on the bottom it says the
Samsung<00:00:47.199> gamepad<00:00:47.589> is<00:00:47.739> required<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.129> you

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
Samsung gamepad is required and so you

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.689 
Samsung gamepad is required and so you
can<00:00:51.670> see<00:00:51.850> it<00:00:51.970> does<00:00:52.180> very<00:00:52.540> little<00:00:52.989> with<00:00:53.769> in

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
can see it does very little with in

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.000 
can see it does very little with in
terms<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.239> just<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.689> gear<00:00:56.170> part<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.860> it's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
terms of just the gear part and it's

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.450 
terms of just the gear part and it's
mostly<00:00:57.280> controlled<00:00:57.699> through<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.830> device

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
mostly controlled through the device

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.259 
mostly controlled through the device
itself<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.629> yeah<00:01:02.049> that's<00:01:02.439> just<00:01:02.850> something<00:01:03.850> to

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.110 
this down and I'm gonna hack it so that
messes<00:02:17.319> up<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.590> camera<00:02:18.069> now<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.519> cameras<00:02:18.969> not

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
messes up the camera now the cameras not

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660 
messes up the camera now the cameras not
good<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.659> check<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.049> by<00:02:21.040> seeing<00:02:21.370> here

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
good and I can check it by seeing here

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.020 
good and I can check it by seeing here
and<00:02:21.909> see<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> camera<00:02:22.599> isn't<00:02:22.719> not<00:02:22.900> anymore<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and see that camera isn't not anymore so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.160 
and see that camera isn't not anymore so
it's<00:02:25.510> been<00:02:25.810> hacked<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.560> now<00:02:29.859> I<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.340> shoot<00:02:30.760> a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it's been hacked so now I can shoot a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.599 
it's been hacked so now I can shoot a
little<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.260> closer<00:02:32.590> though<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:38.409> this<00:02:39.310> game

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
little bit closer though and this game

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.460 
little bit closer though and this game
requires<00:02:40.269> skill<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.139> do<00:02:41.290> need

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
requires skill because you do need

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.300 
requires skill because you do need
headshot

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
headshot

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.979 
headshot
so<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.489> cannot<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:43.000> anything<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.480> headshots

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
so you cannot do anything but headshots

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.420 
so you cannot do anything but headshots
