 the band capixaba natália gáudio and champion 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.800
 of rhythmic gymnastics the year of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.660
 2012 was overtaking the gymnast of 20 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 was elected the best athlete of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.009
 rhythmic gymnastics of the year by award 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 brazilian Olympic organized by the committee 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.410
 Brazilian Olympian faced problems 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 and saw sports as a form of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 move on 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.920
 for 2012 was a difficult year for me to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.770
 year of overcoming so I had many 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 personal problems that I had to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.100
 go over them to be able to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.530
 staying in training was very 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.540
 difficult but I have to thank you very much 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 also for my victories I went 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.610
 champion of all stages, right from the circuit 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 box I think that's what gives me strength 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.520
 to continue I think if I had not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.649
 sport did not have gymnastics family 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 help me, I do not think I could do it 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.830
 move on 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.229
 the best gymnastics athlete award 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 rhythmic 2012 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.130
 It was very important for me to close the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.440
 year with the golden key is like this 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 was the reward of all titles 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.049
 I also won a gold medal in the limit 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 which was done here in victory and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.250
 then so reach the end of the year you 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.070
 receive this award as best athlete 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.680
 He came down from their sport in the middle of that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.740
 both renowned athletes 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.320
 that was very important to me 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.180
 I was very happy and I felt proud 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
 so I saw that actually my work 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 it was worth every effort it was 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.680
 rewarded many achievements in 2013 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 God damn if I want to be tri 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.260
 championship there in Brazilian and has 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
 many steps forward to the stage of 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.570
 World Cup and I want to focus enough 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.729
 in these international seminars to 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.710
 To be able to upload the name of Brazil 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 rhythmic gymnastics out there that is still 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.939
 barely seen so people still have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.850
 prejudice with Brazilian women in 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.179
 endings 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.069
 so I want us to change that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.080
 Brazil's name out there, I want the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.290
 people come and Brazil is well 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.180
 since gymnasts are well spoken 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.850
 so I want every championship 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.959
 improve this result 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.760
 internationally to bring these 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.510
 results for us to have the state and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 to Brazil 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.010
 the importance of the technical team to 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.830
 gymnast does not exist do not have a good 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.200
 so I think all this 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.840
 preparation, we need a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.319
 nutritionist a psychologist all that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.910
 involves and makes us more forward to 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.739
 people to evolve more and more if we 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.410
 did not have the preparation that is 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.209
 behind our entire presentation in the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.760
 time of the competition is just us there in 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.840
 but behind this then of the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.840
 technical team
