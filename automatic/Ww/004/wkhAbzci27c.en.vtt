third<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.140> dexterity<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.450> lethal<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.750> uh<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.380> i

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
third is dexterity and lethal is uh is i

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
third is dexterity and lethal is uh is i
use<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> sim<00:01:44.399> text<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> sim<00:01:45.420> text<00:01:45.689> but

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
use a sim text but i use to sim text but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
use a sim text but i use to sim text but
I<00:01:46.020> guess<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> doesn't<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.710> too<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I guess that doesn't make too much of a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
I guess that doesn't make too much of a
difference<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.320> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
difference and you know what this this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
difference and you know what this this
setup<00:01:49.979> wasn't<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.520> bad<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> little

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
setup wasn't that bad it was a little

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.520 
setup wasn't that bad it was a little
difficult<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.799> because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
difficult just because I don't use the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
difficult just because I don't use the
the<00:01:55.530> assault<00:01:55.890> rifles<00:01:56.219> especially<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> scar

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the assault rifles especially the scar

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
the assault rifles especially the scar
age<00:01:57.600> even<00:01:58.079> though<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.310> one<00:02:00.149> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
age even though this actually is one of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.780 
age even though this actually is one of
the<00:02:00.299> most<00:02:00.420> powerful<00:02:00.750> assault<00:02:01.649> rifles<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the most powerful assault rifles in the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.690 
the most powerful assault rifles in the
game<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> didn't<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.950> think

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
game and if you didn't know that I think

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
game and if you didn't know that I think
it's<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.689> third<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.439> third<00:02:08.099> highest

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's the the third the third highest

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.119 
it's the the third the third highest
fire<00:02:08.759> rate<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.569> third<00:02:09.780> highest<00:02:10.709> damage

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
fire rate or the third highest damage

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.880 
fire rate or the third highest damage
rate<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> game<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.540> far<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.110> assault

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
rate in the game as far as assault

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.619 
rate in the game as far as assault
rifles<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.879> good<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> fire<00:02:15.360> rate

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
rifles go it's really good the fire rate

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.260 
rifles go it's really good the fire rate
not<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.590> good<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:18.090> has<00:02:18.239> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
not that good but you know what it has a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.570 
not that good but you know what it has a
lot<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> recoil<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:19.770> why<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.370> why<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
lot of recoil that's why that's why the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.360 
lot of recoil that's why that's why the
foregrip<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.390> good<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.590> gun<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.129> if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
foregrip is so good with this gun so if

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.760 
foregrip is so good with this gun so if
you<00:02:23.520> do<00:02:23.760> end<00:02:24.120> up<00:02:24.239> using<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.690> weapon<00:02:24.900> i<00:02:25.230> really

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
you do end up using this weapon i really

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.650 
you do end up using this weapon i really
suggest<00:02:25.950> using<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.489> foregrip<00:02:26.879> because<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
suggest using the foregrip because it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.030 
suggest using the foregrip because it
minimizes<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.739> recoil<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.000> does<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
minimizes the recoil and so does the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.259 
minimizes the recoil and so does the
suppressor<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.519> only<00:02:32.670> does<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
suppressor and not only does the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.449 
suppressor and not only does the
suppressor<00:02:33.750> minimize<00:02:34.379> recoil<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.310> also

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
suppressor minimize recoil but it also

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.860 
suppressor minimize recoil but it also
keeps<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.879> off<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.000> mini-map<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:36.720> you're

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
keeps you off the mini-map when you're

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.699 
keeps you off the mini-map when you're
shooting<00:02:37.220> now<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> used<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.819> twosome<00:02:39.269> text<00:02:39.720> on

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
shooting now I used a twosome text on

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.309 
shooting now I used a twosome text on
all<00:02:41.069> my<00:02:41.310> classes<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.269> most<00:02:42.450> part<00:02:42.660> um

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
all my classes for the most part um

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.160 
all my classes for the most part um
unless<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.190> playing<00:02:44.519> hard<00:02:45.300> point<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.900> in

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
unless I'm playing hard point which in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
unless I'm playing hard point which in
this<00:02:46.349> one<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.800> would<00:02:46.920> normally<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.690> using

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
this one I would normally be using

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.479 
this one I would normally be using
bouncing<00:02:49.470> Betties<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
bouncing Betties just because that

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.070 
bouncing Betties just because that
annoys<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.060> hell<00:02:51.269> out<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.480> everybody

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
annoys the hell out of everybody

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.350 
annoys the hell out of everybody
everyone<00:02:52.530> hates<00:02:53.310> bouncing<00:02:53.730> Betties<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.239> I

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
everyone hates bouncing Betties I know I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.119 
everyone hates bouncing Betties I know I
hate<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> when<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.110> get<00:02:55.230> killed<00:02:55.560> by<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> bouncing

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
hate it when I get killed by a bouncing

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.089 
hate it when I get killed by a bouncing
betty<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.900> why<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.140> usually<00:02:58.709> use<00:02:58.920> it

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
betty but I that's why I usually use it

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.070 
betty but I that's why I usually use it
especially<00:02:59.159> in<00:02:59.580> hard<00:02:59.819> point<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.930> it's

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
especially in hard point because it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.130 
especially in hard point because it's
such<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.280> fast-paced<00:03:02.280> game<00:03:03.030> mode<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
such a fast-paced game mode that you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
such a fast-paced game mode that you
know<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.440> lot<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.800> people<00:03:04.890> don't<00:03:05.310> look<00:03:05.519> at<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
know a lot of people don't look at the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.910 
know a lot of people don't look at the
ground<00:03:05.790> while<00:03:06.480> they're<00:03:06.750> running<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.440> by<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
ground while they're running and by the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.979 
ground while they're running and by the
time<00:03:08.069> they<00:03:08.730> hear<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:09.330> buzzer<00:03:09.690> go<00:03:09.959> off

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
time they hear that little buzzer go off

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.199 
time they hear that little buzzer go off
they're<00:03:10.739> ready<00:03:10.890> death<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.150> reason

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
they're ready death so that's the reason

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.899 
they're ready death so that's the reason
why<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.379> for<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.159> video

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
why I do it but for this for this video

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.890 
why I do it but for this for this video
i'm<00:03:15.870> using<00:03:16.349> sim<00:03:16.650> text<00:03:16.980> because<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:17.489> what

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
i'm using sim text because that's what

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.330 
i'm using sim text because that's what
he<00:03:18.900> wanted<00:03:19.170> me<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.379> you<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.830> that's<00:03:19.950> why<00:03:20.220> i'm

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
he wanted me to you so that's why i'm

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.399 
he wanted me to you so that's why i'm
using<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.790> real<00:03:21.420> quick<00:03:21.629> you<00:03:21.810> shoot<00:03:22.050> you

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
using it and real quick you shoot you

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.960 
using it and real quick you shoot you
see<00:03:22.620> me<00:03:22.769> shooting<00:03:23.190> through<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.580> wall<00:03:23.760> right

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
see me shooting through that wall right

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.949 
see me shooting through that wall right
there<00:03:24.120> I'm<00:03:24.330> not<00:03:24.599> crazy<00:03:25.230> or<00:03:25.470> anything<00:03:25.620> um<00:03:26.959> to
