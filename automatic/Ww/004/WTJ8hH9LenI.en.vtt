00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
why is it not just a regular fan how are

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.380 
why is it not just a regular fan how are
you<00:05:01.650> allowed<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.130> put<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.610> into<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.970> lizard

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
you allowed to put you into the lizard

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.240 
you allowed to put you into the lizard
out<00:05:03.540> how<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.930> make<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.380> pan<00:05:04.680> go<00:05:04.950> into<00:05:05.160> the
