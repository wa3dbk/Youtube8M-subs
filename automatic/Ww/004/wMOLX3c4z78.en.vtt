00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
all brown I don't think this is a very

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
all brown I don't think this is a very
good<00:00:20.760> custom<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.449> honest<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
good custom to be honest but this is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.599 
good custom to be honest but this is
just<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> best<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.039> could<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.369> also

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
just the best that I could do also

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.460 
just the best that I could do also
ignore<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> back<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> best<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
could do for group I felt that was that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
could do for group I felt that was that
was<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.660> good<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.050> could<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.740> then

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
was as good as I could get and then

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.939 
was as good as I could get and then

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
there's a little bit of a shame that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
there's a little bit of a shame that
they<00:00:35.280> didn't<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.640> him<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> minifigure<00:00:36.420> version

there but there is the official version
where<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.780> ignore<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.439> because

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
where you do not ignore the back because

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530 
where you do not ignore the back because
the<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.400> awesome<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.909> cool<00:01:21.119> printing

the back is awesome with cool printing
so<00:01:22.530> star-lord<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.970> drops<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.840> probably

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so star-lord then drops this is probably

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
so star-lord then drops this is probably
where<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> biggest<00:01:25.590> differences<00:01:26.250> occur

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
where the biggest differences occur

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
where the biggest differences occur
between<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.380> comic<00:01:29.310> book<00:01:29.490> version<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
between the comic book version and the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.210 
between the comic book version and the
movie<00:01:30.390> version<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> probably<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
movie version this is probably one of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
movie version this is probably one of
the<00:01:32.340> better<00:01:32.579> customs<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.900> guardians

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the better customs I did for guardians

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
the better customs I did for guardians
of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> galaxy<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.479> see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the galaxy as well and as you can see

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.910 
of the galaxy as well and as you can see
the<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> Ulm<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> similar<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> way

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the kind of Ulm is similar with the way

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.050 
the kind of Ulm is similar with the way
that<00:01:38.040> they've<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> same<00:01:38.820> knives

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that they've both got the same knives

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.910 
that they've both got the same knives
but<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> was<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:39.930> obvious<00:01:40.200> thing<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
but that was an obvious thing to do and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.179 
but that was an obvious thing to do and
again<00:01:41.490> ignore<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> back<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.270> mind<00:01:42.649> but<00:01:43.649> don't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
again ignore the back on mind but don't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
again ignore the back on mind but don't
on<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.299> yeah<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:45.630> happy<00:01:45.930> with

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
on this one but yeah pretty happy with

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.210 
on this one but yeah pretty happy with
with<00:01:46.320> drafts<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:48.420> we've<00:01:48.570> got<00:01:49.220> Rocket

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
