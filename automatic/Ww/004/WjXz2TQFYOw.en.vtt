00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
actually would be like it I think I do

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.500 
actually would be like it I think I do
prefer<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:03.770> purplish<00:06:04.550> lip<00:06:04.940> butter<00:06:05.120> I<00:06:05.300> just

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
prefer the purplish lip butter I just

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.570 
prefer the purplish lip butter I just
showed<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:05.690> but<00:06:05.990> i<00:06:06.140> do<00:06:06.200> really<00:06:06.530> think<00:06:06.920> this

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
showed you but i do really think this

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
looks quite good and i think as i read

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.820 
looks quite good and i think as i read
it<00:06:10.250> more<00:06:10.400> i<00:06:10.460> might<00:06:10.820> develop<00:06:11.210> more<00:06:11.480> of<00:06:11.600> an

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
it more i might develop more of an

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.960 
it more i might develop more of an
and<00:06:11.920> you<00:06:12.040> know<00:06:12.160> member<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:12.820> actually

and you know member and I actually

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.690 
and you know member and I actually
really<00:06:13.420> like<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:13.810> consistency<00:06:14.020> of<00:06:14.890> this

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
really like the consistency of this

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.610 
really like the consistency of this
product<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.480> seems<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.900> feel<00:06:17.140> really<00:06:17.410> nice

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620

on<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.920> lips<00:06:18.160> and<00:06:18.430> it<00:06:18.580> seems<00:06:18.790> the<00:06:18.970> last<00:06:19.180> pretty

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510

well<00:06:19.750> so<00:06:20.590> yeah<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.430> think<00:06:21.700> I'm<00:06:22.090> going<00:06:22.210> to

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.270 
well so yeah I think I'm going to
continue<00:06:22.570> around<00:06:22.780> since<00:06:23.320> you<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.860> can<00:06:24.100> pull<00:06:24.250> off

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
continue around since you I can pull off

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.420 
continue around since you I can pull off
the<00:06:24.520> purple<00:06:24.820> Oakland<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:26.230> if<00:06:26.350> I<00:06:26.440> can<00:06:26.680> then

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.700 
the purple Oakland and if I can then
maybe<00:06:27.880> I'll<00:06:28.060> bench<00:06:28.300> out<00:06:28.630> something<00:06:29.230> even<00:06:29.530> more

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
maybe I'll bench out something even more

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410
