from<00:00:21.960> scorpion<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:23.130> an<00:00:23.340> intermediate<00:00:23.609> head

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
from scorpion it's an intermediate head

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720 
from scorpion it's an intermediate head
shaped<00:00:24.359> design<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> new<00:00:25.619> style<00:00:26.070> shell<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
shaped design with a new style shell and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
shaped design with a new style shell and
that<00:00:26.760> new<00:00:26.970> shell<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> gonna<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> TCT<00:00:28.500> shell

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
that new shell is gonna be the TCT shell

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.250 
that new shell is gonna be the TCT shell
that<00:00:29.160> we're<00:00:29.279> also<00:00:29.429> seeing<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> AR<00:00:30.260> 2000

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that we're also seeing on the AR 2000

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.900 
that we're also seeing on the AR 2000
what<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.800> means<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.219> instead<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.759> being

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
what that means is instead of just being

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
what that means is instead of just being
a<00:00:33.030> fiberglass<00:00:33.570> shell<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> believe<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.770> VX

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
a fiberglass shell and I believe the VX

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
a fiberglass shell and I believe the VX
34<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> polycarbonate<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.989> fiberglass

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
34 is a polycarbonate the fiberglass

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
34 is a polycarbonate the fiberglass
shell<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:37.980> try<00:00:38.190> composite<00:00:38.790> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
shell it's actually try composite so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
shell it's actually try composite so
it's<00:00:39.090> fiberglass<00:00:39.300> aramid<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.200> organic

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it's fiberglass aramid and organic

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
it's fiberglass aramid and organic
polymers<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> allows<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
polymers and what that allows you to do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.080 
polymers and what that allows you to do
is<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> lighter<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.860> stronger<00:00:44.370> shell<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is get a lighter but stronger shell we

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.130 
is get a lighter but stronger shell we
measured<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.690> medium<00:00:46.289> sized<00:00:46.969> v<00:00:47.969> XR<00:00:48.300> 70<00:00:48.780> right

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
measured a medium sized v XR 70 right

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
measured a medium sized v XR 70 right
around<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> three<00:00:49.860> pound<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.399> ounce<00:00:50.610> mark

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
around that three pound one ounce mark

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
around that three pound one ounce mark
which<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.480> light<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> dirt<00:00:52.079> helmet

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
which is very light for a dirt helmet

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
which is very light for a dirt helmet
now<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> look<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> very

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now if we look at it it's very

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.950 
now if we look at it it's very
aggressive<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> matte<00:00:54.690> black<00:00:54.870> version

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
cheek pads and through this pump your
Reebok<00:01:17.670> would<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.150> mad<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.750> saying

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Reebok would get so mad at me for saying

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
Reebok would get so mad at me for saying
this<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.470> invented<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> pump

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
this but they invented that pump

this but they invented that pump
technology<00:01:20.369> 25<00:01:21.270> years<00:01:21.509> ago<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.229> we've

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
technology 25 years ago and now we've

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
technology 25 years ago and now we've
seen<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:22.890> its<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.670> into

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
seen it make its way all the way into

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
seen it make its way all the way into
helmets<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> custom<00:01:24.750> fit<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.080> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
helmets for a custom fit which is just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.050 
helmets for a custom fit which is just
so<00:01:25.500> cool<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:25.890> opinion<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
so cool in my opinion but you have that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
so cool in my opinion but you have that
ability<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.810> custom<00:01:28.170> tune<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.560> cheek<00:01:28.829> pads

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
ability to custom tune those cheek pads

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
ability to custom tune those cheek pads
what<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> also<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:31.140> tool-free<00:01:32.390> grill

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
what you also have is a tool-free grill

now if we look here I'm gonna move it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.390 
now if we look here I'm gonna move it
around<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.750> back<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.829> see<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.280> my

I'm going to break it up onto the table
here<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:41.560> start<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.159> D<00:02:42.700> gut<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.359> we<00:02:44.140> can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
here and start to D gut it and we can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.899 
here and start to D gut it and we can
see<00:02:44.379> us<00:02:44.470> as<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.739> pulling<00:02:45.159> out<00:02:45.250> my<00:02:45.310> cheek<00:02:45.670> pads

slightly different than the r200 but
again<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.159> built<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.639> dirt<00:02:48.849> scenario

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
again it's built for the dirt scenario

snaps that kind of go into the neck roll

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.470 
snaps that kind of go into the neck roll
it's<00:02:53.769> one<00:02:53.980> piece<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.489> as<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.090> pull<00:02:55.299> them<00:02:55.420> out

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
the button it goes right down again a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.369 
the button it goes right down again a
nice<00:03:23.530> touch<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:25.180> from<00:03:25.419> my<00:03:25.449> normal<00:03:26.049> liner

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
nice touch and then from my normal liner

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.770 
nice touch and then from my normal liner
standpoint<00:03:27.010> when<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.060> snaps<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.569> back

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
standpoint when I have snaps in the back

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.430 
standpoint when I have snaps in the back
and<00:03:29.970> then<00:03:30.970> as<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.209> move<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.569> front<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and then as I move to the front the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then as I move to the front the
connection<00:03:32.889> point<00:03:33.099> is<00:03:33.220> along<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.609> brow<00:03:33.819> so<00:03:34.090> it

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
connection point is along the brow so it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.939 
connection point is along the brow so it
doesn't<00:03:34.389> create<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.599> hot<00:03:34.780> spot<00:03:35.019> sometimes

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
doesn't create a hot spot sometimes

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.409 
doesn't create a hot spot sometimes
these<00:03:36.129> can<00:03:36.280> be<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> little<00:03:36.609> trickier<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> remove

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
these can be a little trickier to remove

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.050 
these can be a little trickier to remove
but<00:03:38.049> I'd<00:03:38.290> rather<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:39.310> fickleness<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
but I'd rather have the fickleness of

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.689 
but I'd rather have the fickleness of
removing<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.659> brow<00:03:40.959> connected<00:03:41.590> comfort<00:03:42.519> liner

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
removing a brow connected comfort liner

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.849 
removing a brow connected comfort liner
then<00:03:43.389> have<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:43.900> potential<00:03:44.290> hotspot<00:03:44.829> of

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
then have the potential hotspot of

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.259 
then have the potential hotspot of
having<00:03:45.250> snaps<00:03:45.549> right<00:03:45.760> here<00:03:45.940> along<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.239> front

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
having snaps right here along the front

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.210 
having snaps right here along the front
so<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:46.930> see<00:03:47.049> 3d<00:03:47.560> shape<00:03:47.799> here<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.129> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so you can see 3d shape here on the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.250 
so you can see 3d shape here on the
comfort<00:03:48.519> liner<00:03:48.729> again<00:03:49.209> washable<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.079> meant
