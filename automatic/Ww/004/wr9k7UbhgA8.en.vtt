00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
just kind of Curtis with that was that a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
just kind of Curtis with that was that a
vector<00:00:35.219> continuity<00:00:35.730> I'll<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
vector continuity I'll be with a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.110 
vector continuity I'll be with a
different<00:00:37.079> line<00:00:37.380> yeah<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> mean<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> obviously

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
different line yeah I mean it obviously

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
different line yeah I mean it obviously
uh<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:40.290> produces<00:00:40.680> different<00:00:40.800> challenges<00:00:41.309> each

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
uh it produces different challenges each

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
is the concentration now on knowing the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.560 
is the concentration now on knowing the
plays<00:04:57.950> making<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.520> accurate<00:04:58.970> throw<00:04:59.240> yeah<00:04:59.540> I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
plays making the accurate throw yeah I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.810 
plays making the accurate throw yeah I
mean<00:05:00.040> that's<00:05:01.040> not<00:05:01.220> that's<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.490> biggest<00:05:01.669> thing

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
mean that's not that's the biggest thing

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.670 
mean that's not that's the biggest thing
I<00:05:02.000> think<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.389> knowing<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.900> plays<00:05:03.110> what

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
I think is just knowing the plays what

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.469 
I think is just knowing the plays what
footwork<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.160> have<00:05:04.280> on<00:05:04.460> which<00:05:04.640> plays<00:05:04.940> it's

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
footwork you have on which plays it's

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.290 
footwork you have on which plays it's
all<00:05:05.720> different<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.669> just<00:05:07.669> knowing<00:05:07.850> what<00:05:08.270> I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
all different so just knowing what I

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.060 
all different so just knowing what I
have<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.750> do<00:05:08.900> like<00:05:09.050> what<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.500> objective<00:05:09.979> of

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
have to do like what the objective of

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.100 
have to do like what the objective of
the<00:05:10.160> play<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.600> personally<00:05:11.600> as<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.750> quarterback

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
the play is personally as a quarterback

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.700 
the play is personally as a quarterback
and<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:13.190> read<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.729> my<00:05:13.790> footwork<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.710> the

for<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:26.900> guys<00:05:27.050> yeah<00:05:27.530> i<00:05:27.560> think<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.919> scrimmages

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
for you guys yeah i think the scrimmages

will<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.640> uh<00:05:28.669> i<00:05:29.300> mean<00:05:30.200> they'll<00:05:30.350> be<00:05:30.440> huge<00:05:30.710> for<00:05:30.770> us

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
will be uh i mean they'll be huge for us

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.090 
will be uh i mean they'll be huge for us
to<00:05:31.130> go<00:05:31.250> he'll<00:05:31.550> show<00:05:31.789> what<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.740> mean<00:05:33.740> how<00:05:33.950> much

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
to go he'll show what I mean how much

to go he'll show what I mean how much
we've<00:05:34.280> progressed<00:05:34.940> from<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.870> first<00:05:36.080> week

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
we've progressed from the first week

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.420 
we've progressed from the first week
we'll<00:05:36.650> see<00:05:36.770> what<00:05:36.890> happened<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.220> scrimmage

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
I think scrimmages will be better to use

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.630 
I think scrimmages will be better to use
will<00:05:39.050> be<00:05:39.169> everyone<00:05:39.710> be<00:05:39.830> pumped<00:05:40.160> forward<00:05:40.490> and

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
will be everyone be pumped forward and

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.790 
will be everyone be pumped forward and

counting every kind of day was kind of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.500 
counting every kind of day was kind of
slow<00:05:43.039> and<00:05:43.360> everyone<00:05:44.360> was<00:05:44.450> getting

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
slow and everyone was getting

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.270 
slow and everyone was getting
discouraged<00:05:44.900> with<00:05:45.289> some<00:05:45.470> of<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> snap<00:05:45.830> counts

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
discouraged with some of the snap counts

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.760 
discouraged with some of the snap counts
we<00:05:46.430> had<00:05:46.610> had<00:05:47.479> a<00:05:47.510> couple<00:05:47.960> mental<00:05:48.320> errors<00:05:48.620> today
