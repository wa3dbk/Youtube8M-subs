00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
honestly I thought the Iron Man arm was

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.390 
honestly I thought the Iron Man arm was
some<00:03:13.200> kind<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.440> motorbike<00:03:13.830> initially<00:03:14.250> because

him<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.350> walking<00:03:37.530> through<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.920> area<00:03:38.100> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
him kind of walking through the area of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
him kind of walking through the area of
where<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.430> saw<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.640> Ultron<00:03:39.030> factory<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.720> they

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
where we saw the Ultron factory and they

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.160 
where we saw the Ultron factory and they
were<00:03:40.230> using<00:03:40.260> his<00:03:40.970> Loki's<00:03:41.970> even<00:03:42.209> sector<00:03:42.690> so
