00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.999
 great victory the harvested this afternoon by the real zaragoza the whole 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.700
 Aragonese has endorsed the good image given last Saturday against the real 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.469
 society 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.919
 and has beaten the palms by two goals to zero 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.940
 deploying at times good football and showing solvency back despite that 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.289
 the absences forced marcelino garcía 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.089
 align a defense of circumstances 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.509
 shortly after starting gaby stole a ball in midfield and played well for 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.289
 everton 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.109
 but the top scorer's shot goes wide 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.869
 Little time has passed until the Aragonese team has achieved 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.300
 get ahead on the scoreboard 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.050
 ran the minute 10 corner kick dribbled by jorge lópez and songo'o 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.870
 foreseeably only inside the area hits pleasure to santa maría 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 first goal of the Cameroonian with the shirt of Real Zaragoza 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.790
 could tie the palms shortly after the zaragocista but the auction 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.220
 marcos marquez goes over the goal 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.720
 the Aragonese squad enjoyed several chances to kill the match 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 but sometimes the visiting defense and sometimes the lack of local aim 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.020
 they have left the score as it was until the break 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.610
 especially clear has been a shot by Jorge Lopez after horseback riding 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.370
 arizmendi on the right that is lost by little 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.800
 and the everton header 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.450
 As he waits for the Brazilian to be in the correct position, he served him a ball 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 measured but the header and it comes out too centered 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 the second part ran along the same lines as the first 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 zaragoza looking for and deserving the psoe 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.830
 just start, start it, play it first for arizmendi but santamaría 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.390
 dismissed his shot to corner 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.400
 to the quarter of hour lopez vallejo that until then had happened totally 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.030
 unnoticed he avoided the tie 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.219
 Darino is left alone and the local goalkeeper gets between the ball 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.660
 immediately afterwards he was aiming to sign his second goal of the night but 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
 after a counter driven by arizmendi his shot crashed 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 he rejects but his current before he can shoot on goal 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.540
 with almost 30 minutes to play marcelino garcía prd towards the new 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.640
 pearl of the quarry 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.360
 ander herrera jorge lópez 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 again lopez vallejo shapoval team to get ahead of marcos marquez after 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.659
 this good play of the canaries 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.039
 but the key because of a possible tie was passed to 2 0 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.839
 after lopez vallejo kick the ball falls to zongo 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.349
 its center reaches the feet of 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.789
 the visiting defender 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.249
 and the pichichi solves the perfection against santamarina 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.209
 great control 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.699
 best shot of the Brazilian 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.959
 there was not time for much more if perhaps for the revival of leo ponzio 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.199
 as 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.619
 and to enjoy some detail of herrera 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.889
 touching the end the palms could put the fear in the body to tier and team 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.119
 but walls identified just what 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.239
 to leave things as they are 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.119
 and after the weekend grapes begin to be more 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.459
 Real Zaragoza confirms its improvement and face the next two games 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.649
 away from the romareda in one of the best moments of the season
