he's a biologist I've been working with

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320 
he's a biologist I've been working with
on<00:00:09.660> tagging<00:00:10.050> these<00:00:10.139> fish<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.730> he's<00:00:11.730> I'm

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
on tagging these fish and he's I'm

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.789 
on tagging these fish and he's I'm
getting<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> data<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.290> he's<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.769> know

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
getting all the data and he's you know

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.580 
getting all the data and he's you know
analyzing<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.820> seeing<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.230> you

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
analyzing it and seeing what the you

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890 
analyzing it and seeing what the you
know<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:17.609> old<00:00:17.820> these<00:00:17.940> fish<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.390> how<00:00:18.720> long

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
know how old these fish are how long

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.670 
know how old these fish are how long
they<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.080> live

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
they can live

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
they can live
what<00:00:19.800> their<00:00:19.949> growth<00:00:20.130> rates<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.090> all<00:00:21.689> that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
what their growth rates are and all that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.750 
what their growth rates are and all that
stuff<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> put<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
stuff we're just going to put in a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
stuff we're just going to put in a
spaghetti<00:00:24.359> tag<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> these<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.380> orange

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
spaghetti tag one of these little orange

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.870 
spaghetti tag one of these little orange
Floyd<00:00:26.070> tag<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:28.880> stick

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Floyd tag and all we do is just stick

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
Floyd tag and all we do is just stick
that<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that in right there and it's got a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
that in right there and it's got a
unique<00:00:32.309> number<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:33.030> fishes<00:00:33.420> 15<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:33.960> 1<00:00:34.309> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
unique number then fishes 15 or 1 and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.590 
unique number then fishes 15 or 1 and
there's<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.760> phone<00:00:35.940> number<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
there's just a phone number on there to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
there's just a phone number on there to
call<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> fish<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> captured<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.370> we

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
call it if that fish is captured so we

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.369 
call it if that fish is captured so we
know<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.820> happened<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.210> she's<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.079> tag

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
know what happened to it she's gonna tag

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.900 
know what happened to it she's gonna tag
in<00:00:40.559> her<00:00:40.680> oh<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> abhi<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.640> tagging<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> fish

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
in her oh so abhi this tagging the fish

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
in her oh so abhi this tagging the fish
is<00:00:48.059> gonna<00:00:48.239> allow<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> love<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.050> some

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is gonna allow it love to get some

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
is gonna allow it love to get some
population<00:00:49.980> size<00:00:50.520> estimates<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
population size estimates on this and so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.779 
population size estimates on this and so
that's<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> early

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that's kind of in the very in the early

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's kind of in the very in the early
beginning<00:00:54.210> stages<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
beginning stages but that's really just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
beginning stages but that's really just
a<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.399> terms<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> understanding<00:00:56.940> about

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a start in terms of understanding about

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
a start in terms of understanding about
these<00:00:57.809> these<00:00:58.109> gars<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.649> isn't<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.039> yeah

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
these these gars out here isn't it yeah

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
these these gars out here isn't it yeah
exactly<00:00:59.789> Rob<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.809> Kirk's<00:01:01.020> help<00:01:01.260> we've<00:01:01.500> been

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
exactly Rob with Kirk's help we've been

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
exactly Rob with Kirk's help we've been
able<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> rough<00:01:02.280> population<00:01:02.879> estimate

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
able to get a rough population estimate

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
able to get a rough population estimate
so<00:01:03.359> far<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:04.589> estimate<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> number<00:01:05.729> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so far we estimate that the number of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
so far we estimate that the number of
fish<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.479> stretch<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> river<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
fish and this stretch of the river is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
fish and this stretch of the river is
probably<00:01:07.530> about<00:01:07.650> 40,000<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.939> being<00:01:09.150> above

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
probably about 40,000 that being above

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
probably about 40,000 that being above
Lake<00:01:09.630> Livingston<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.830> catches<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.310> fish

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
Lake Livingston as he catches more fish

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
Lake Livingston as he catches more fish
and<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.000> recaptures<00:01:12.540> we'll<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.780> able

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and we get more recaptures we'll be able

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380 
and we get more recaptures we'll be able
to<00:01:12.930> improve<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.270> know

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to improve that and have much you know

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.749 
to improve that and have much you know
tighter<00:01:15.659> estimate<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:17.400> top<00:01:17.549> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
tighter estimate of that on top that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.770 
tighter estimate of that on top that
we've<00:01:17.880> been<00:01:18.000> able<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.570> size

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we've been able to look at size

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
we've been able to look at size
structure<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.500> percentage<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
structure and what percentage of the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
structure and what percentage of the
fish<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.520> our<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.570> trophies<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
fish are our you know trophies like you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.460 
fish are our you know trophies like you
just<00:01:22.619> released<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.049> estimate

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
just released we right now we estimate

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
just released we right now we estimate
that<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.740> five<00:01:26.220> percent<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that about five percent of the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.469 
that about five percent of the
population<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.799> roughly<00:01:29.490> six<00:01:29.820> feet<00:01:29.909> six

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
population is over roughly six feet six

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.890 
population is over roughly six feet six
six<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> half<00:01:30.960> feet<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.600> we've<00:01:33.600> estimated

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
six and a half feet and we've estimated

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.330 
six and a half feet and we've estimated
that<00:01:34.259> sustainable<00:01:34.799> harvest<00:01:35.130> would<00:01:35.189> be

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that sustainable harvest would be

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.410 
that sustainable harvest would be
somewhere<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> neighborhood<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.240> about

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
5%<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.740> based<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> their<00:01:38.250> life

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
5% and that's based on their life

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
5% and that's based on their life
history<00:01:38.790> much<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.509> sturgeon<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.049> live<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
history much like sturgeon they live a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
history much like sturgeon they live a
long<00:01:40.409> time<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:41.310> don't<00:01:41.340> reproduce<00:01:41.640> every

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
long time they don't reproduce every

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
long time they don't reproduce every
year<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.140> need<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.890> understand

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
year so we need to you know understand

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.499 
year so we need to you know understand
those<00:01:44.490> things<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.149> talking<00:01:45.390> about

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
those things so you're talking about

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
those things so you're talking about
just<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> handful<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> those<00:01:46.530> real<00:01:46.740> trophy<00:01:47.040> fish

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just a handful of those real trophy fish

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
just a handful of those real trophy fish
that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.540> believe<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that you know that we believe is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
that you know that we believe is
sustainable<00:01:49.439> harvest<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.130> they've<00:01:50.280> based<00:01:50.579> on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
sustainable harvest so they've based on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.660 
sustainable harvest so they've based on
based<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> data<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.810> far<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
based on the data so far then that the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
based on the data so far then that the
state<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> coming<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> new<00:01:55.380> regulation

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
state is coming up with a new regulation

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
state is coming up with a new regulation
than<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.159> first<00:01:56.430> time<00:01:56.579> ever<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> guard

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
than the first time ever for the guard

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.840 
than the first time ever for the guard
yeah<00:01:57.750> Rob<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.110> correct<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:59.610> went<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
yeah Rob that's correct we we went to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.190 
yeah Rob that's correct we we went to
the<00:01:59.939> Commission<00:02:00.149> earlier<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.630> year<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.049> got

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the Commission earlier this year we got

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.639 
the Commission earlier this year we got
a<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.680> fish<00:02:01.890> per<00:02:01.920> day<00:02:02.100> regulation<00:02:02.759> passed<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
a one fish per day regulation passed and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.080 
a one fish per day regulation passed and
for<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.700> least<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.969> give

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
for now that's you know at least to give

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.580 
for now that's you know at least to give
some<00:02:06.329> protection<00:02:06.840> whereas<00:02:07.229> we're<00:02:07.469> learning

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
some protection whereas we're learning

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.520 
some protection whereas we're learning
more<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:07.950> these<00:02:08.399> fish<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.140> areas<00:02:10.440> we

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
more about these fish in some areas we

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
more about these fish in some areas we
may<00:02:10.679> find<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.849> regulations

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
may find that you know more regulations

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
may find that you know more regulations
than<00:02:12.450> necessary<00:02:13.050> another

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
than necessary another

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
than necessary another
is<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.160> regulation<00:02:14.520> may<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:14.910> sufficient<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
is that regulation may be sufficient it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.790 
is that regulation may be sufficient it
really<00:02:15.750> depends<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
really depends on you know the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.100 
really depends on you know the
recruitment<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.750> many<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.020> these

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
recruitment and and how many of these

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.020 
recruitment and and how many of these
fish<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:19.560> are<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.190> help<00:02:20.370> from<00:02:20.459> people

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
fish there are so with help from people

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.699 
fish there are so with help from people
like<00:02:21.270> Kirk<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:21.750> able<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.080> determine<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
like Kirk we're able to determine that

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.100 
like Kirk we're able to determine that
so<00:02:23.220> these<00:02:23.370> fish<00:02:23.670> might<00:02:24.180> only<00:02:24.510> spawn<00:02:24.780> once

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
so these fish might only spawn once

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
so these fish might only spawn once
every<00:02:25.470> five<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> seven<00:02:26.670> years<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.330> who<00:02:27.630> knows

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
every five to seven years or who knows

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.449 
every five to seven years or who knows
it's<00:02:28.110> kind<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.530> panda<00:02:28.830> lake<00:02:28.980> sturgeon

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
it's kind of like panda lake sturgeon

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
it's kind of like panda lake sturgeon
now<00:02:29.640> there's<00:02:29.850> another<00:02:29.940> fishery<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:30.930> like

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
now there's another fishery that's like

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:44.280 
now there's another fishery that's like
this<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:32.130> real<00:02:32.370> special<00:02:32.790> fish

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.880 

what<00:02:45.760> creature<00:02:46.760> there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:04.400 

you<00:02:53.890> call<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:57.209> really<00:02:58.209> get<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.510> one<00:02:58.750> him

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.130 

man<00:03:05.440> Kirk<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.940> know<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.750> can't<00:03:08.020> go

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
man Kirk you know this you can't go

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.590 
man Kirk you know this you can't go
