00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.910
 so from submarines comes to a glacier one degree I would say 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.899
 she's got my nose full 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:08.889
 I only have 1 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.690
 Special yellow-red Kleinmann and seal just on pulse4 so that man is for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.349
 I go to the Special Guest today and the place 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 Aeropostale 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.599
 that's a good friend of mine 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.260
 I frieze 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.050
 IZ 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 then pack everything fresh 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.060
 both then i show it is quite short for the squad so it has to be in the beginning 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 Taillight 2 mln 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 At the beginning of the photo I had a drain that went backwards as we could 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 the whole three teams want to but that was going to be with a suit 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.150
 So I just have 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 installed the elevator here 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.270
 show now speaks no 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.000
 like the whole of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 a man out 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.989
 to fuel from the duo Mario Gomez 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 So we stayed until the 4 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.960
 so the tests 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 clicking 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.180
 so is always a sensual 5 um I almost grab by myself because that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.140
 otherwise the 50th would have taken too long 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 own for it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 Moment Mary 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 Just now and in Meran everything is running leisurely 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 and too much 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 so all now so no 1 after 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 and so do the loo 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.800
 I'll show Sam advantages thats neither neither has it all individually 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.680
 illuminate 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.410
 He looks the same everywhere with the racist list 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.700
 however 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.230
 No, that's right at the back 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
 I do not tell you this room is big and big 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 for the reason that I do not like it that way 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.960
 I do not want to be embarrassed 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.659
 when a solo in the community calls in 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.049
 St 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.269
 and so 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.529
 get hurt 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.739
 crop year 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.540
 they did not pick that up with a lot of students so I did 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.909
 This is also what DD DD DD DD looks like 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.499
 we wanted 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 People and not out 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.589
 Thoroughbred from that it goes out 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.589
 SZ and grain and on the Upper Rhine 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.409
 just as it is all OK right now we go out 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 and it's pretty simple how well that works here 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.219
 it fly 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.559
 and drive with closed 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 Bundesliga ProB 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 Sissi right 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.889
 make her 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 Moment when he does that to it 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.349
 and you have to ask immediately 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.539
 Jakob Poulsen 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
 v Anette Barth 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 although that displeases one of the classics like nothing more 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.579
 So here the whole mass is played all the principle of one 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.989
 Mousetrap you should be able to 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.989

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.359
 Right now I'm in cheers 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.419

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:44.829
 human 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.059
 Stenzels exactly 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.489

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.529
 Ork 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.569
 No, it means wait 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.879
 and wait and expect Daum 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.989
 according to Commission information 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
 I get started already 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.909
 as the pig's cremation drips well if not stupid march 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.549
 met 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.549
 so things were washed ashore and how do they just go up 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.489
 Viersen ots of assistants Kossendey is swimming 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.259

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.819
 especially a lot of 4 yes m 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.389
 I would say 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.169
 I'm going here for an hour now 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.419
 do this at this point 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.090
 but keep a cape 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.889
 unit4 will see us again 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.889
 Schulz 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.090
 RUB 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.309

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.809
 so who knows if an hour was apart what is happening now 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.419
 put everything in it 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:00.530
 around 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.009
 So I hope you enjoyed that lithium 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.270
 I really would not have it on me so soon that's not always possible for me 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.849
 that's going to happen soon 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.869
 Roth is a monster or whatever 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.449
