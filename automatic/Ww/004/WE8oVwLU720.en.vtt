about going for a counter-attack I think
that's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> smart<00:00:45.719> move<00:00:46.050> from<00:00:46.200> fire<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.590> here

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
look at that though nice little stasis

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
look at that though nice little stasis

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there from pure mansion catch the vessel

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
there from pure mansion catch the vessel
and<00:00:56.940> fire<00:00:57.239> heroes<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.020> treating

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and fire heroes actually for treating

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
and fire heroes actually for treating
now<00:00:58.410> he's<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> defend<00:00:59.850> himself

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
now he's gonna try to defend himself

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
now he's gonna try to defend himself
again<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.840> don't<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> right

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
again I don't think this is the right

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
again I don't think this is the right
move<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.190> needs<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> gone<00:01:03.239> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
move I think he needs to have gone for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
move I think he needs to have gone for
more<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> intact<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.890> units<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.430> stuff

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
more of a intact more units and stuff

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
more of a intact more units and stuff
just<00:01:05.610> expanding<00:01:06.240> he<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.420> falling<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
just expanding he is falling into the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.679 
just expanding he is falling into the
flash<00:01:07.380> mistake<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:09.060> expanding<00:01:09.570> without

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
flash mistake of over expanding without

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539 
flash mistake of over expanding without
getting<00:01:10.080> enough<00:01:10.380> army<00:01:10.770> without<00:01:11.070> attacking

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
getting enough army without attacking

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
getting enough army without attacking
enough<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> end<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> looks<00:01:14.369> like

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
enough and and in the end it looks like

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
enough and and in the end it looks like
pure<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.119> whose<00:01:15.330> strategy<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> better

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
pure is the one whose strategy is better

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
pure is the one whose strategy is better
because<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.070> pure<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.490> moving<00:01:17.759> out

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because look at this pure is moving out

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030 
because look at this pure is moving out
yet<00:01:18.060> again<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.360> fire<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.780> hero<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.979> know

holding pure off but look at this he

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
holding pure off but look at this he
can't<00:01:28.170> defend<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:29.070> bases<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:30.150> he

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
can't defend both bases because he

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
can't defend both bases because he
doesn't<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.659> any<00:01:30.840> degree<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.200> map<00:01:31.409> control

from<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.230> north<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.710> he<00:04:34.890> doesn't<00:04:35.190> even<00:04:35.250> do

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
from the north and he doesn't even do

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.070 
from the north and he doesn't even do
anything<00:04:35.700> with<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.030> group<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.690> units<00:04:36.960> are

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
camping out in the middle it looks like

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.070 
camping out in the middle it looks like
he's<00:04:38.760> just<00:04:38.880> reading<00:04:39.240> them<00:04:39.420> back<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.930> the

he's just reading them back to on the
right<00:04:40.260> side<00:04:40.530> he<00:04:41.490> hasn't<00:04:41.700> even<00:04:41.760> taken<00:04:42.000> out<00:04:42.240> this

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
right side he hasn't even taken out this

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.990 
right side he hasn't even taken out this
new<00:04:42.570> base<00:04:42.750> yet<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:44.430> going<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.730> be<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
new base yet and that's going to be the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.990 
new base yet and that's going to be the
end<00:04:45.180> here<00:04:45.390> he's<00:04:45.510> lost<00:04:45.720> as<00:04:45.960> mineral<00:04:46.680> only<00:04:46.920> I<00:04:47.550> I

nothing<00:05:28.560> at<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.740> top<00:05:28.950> by<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> way<00:05:29.310> that's

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
nothing at the top by the way that's

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.180 
nothing at the top by the way that's
just<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.790> refinery<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:31.290> he's<00:05:31.650> got<00:05:31.830> nothing

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190

going<00:05:32.340> on<00:05:32.550> here<00:05:32.910> I'm<00:05:33.510> pretty<00:05:33.720> much<00:05:33.810> in<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
going on here I'm pretty much in the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.790 
game not sure what he's doing staying in
i<00:05:36.450> guess<00:05:36.480> just<00:05:36.780> desperately<00:05:37.200> trying<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.560> pull

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
i guess just desperately trying to pull

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.940 
i guess just desperately trying to pull
something<00:05:38.070> off<00:05:38.310> he's<00:05:38.850> got<00:05:39.060> SCV's<00:05:39.600> tanks<00:05:40.470> just

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
something off he's got SCV's tanks just

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.140 
something off he's got SCV's tanks just
struggling<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.820> find<00:05:41.970> somewhere<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.420> go<00:05:42.630> and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
struggling to find somewhere to go and

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.360 
struggling to find somewhere to go and
some<00:05:45.150> dt's<00:05:45.570> out<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.080> mean<00:05:46.260> pure<00:05:46.950> shouldn't<00:05:47.310> be

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
some dt's out I mean pure shouldn't be

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.430 
some dt's out I mean pure shouldn't be
having<00:05:47.520> any<00:05:47.730> economic<00:05:48.360> problems<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.050> they

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
having any economic problems here they

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.290 
having any economic problems here they
are<00:05:49.560> showing<00:05:49.800> his<00:05:50.040> basis<00:05:50.460> but<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.670> think<00:05:50.910> this

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
are showing his basis but I think this

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.020 
are showing his basis but I think this
is<00:05:51.450> just<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.720> show<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:52.920> he<00:05:53.370> still<00:05:53.640> has<00:05:53.790> you

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
is just a show that he still has you

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.310 
is just a show that he still has you
know<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> lot<00:05:54.570> of<00:05:54.600> different<00:05:54.690> types<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.200> units

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
know a lot of different types of units

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.500 
know a lot of different types of units
around<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.980> he<00:05:56.610> should<00:05:56.820> have<00:05:57.000> you<00:05:57.150> know<00:05:57.180> three

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
around and he should have you know three

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.780 
around and he should have you know three
or<00:05:57.660> four<00:05:58.170> fresh<00:05:58.500> bases<00:05:58.980> still<00:05:59.190> three
