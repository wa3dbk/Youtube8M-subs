on<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.720> simplest<00:02:56.380> level<00:02:56.489> because<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.640> can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
on the simplest level because I can

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.210 
on the simplest level because I can
create<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.330> base<00:02:58.660> exposure<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.380> then<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.040> can

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
create a base exposure and then I can

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.490 
create a base exposure and then I can
think<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.910> if<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.150> will<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.320> other

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
think that if you will to all my other

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.380 
think that if you will to all my other
exposures<00:03:02.950> right<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:05.680> great<00:03:06.390> so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
exposures right there that's great so

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.000 
exposures right there that's great so
I'm<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.750> create<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.110> camera<00:03:08.799> calibration

can now select all the other images from
this<00:03:50.769> shoot<00:03:51.130> from<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.610> same<00:03:51.910> set<00:03:52.660> of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
this shoot from this same set of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.949 
this shoot from this same set of
conditions<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.829> let's<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.370> go<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:55.209> here<00:03:55.720> for

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
conditions so let's just go to here for

conditions so let's just go to here for
example<00:03:56.110> as<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:57.130> test<00:03:57.549> select<00:03:58.390> those<00:03:58.570> images<00:03:58.930> I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
example as a test select those images I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.960 
example as a test select those images I
now<00:04:00.190> choose<00:04:00.480> sync<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:03.250> I'm<00:04:03.579> going<00:04:03.820> to

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
now choose sync and all I'm going to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.850 
now choose sync and all I'm going to
sink<00:04:04.390> i'm<00:04:04.600> going<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.840> choose<00:04:05.140> check<00:04:05.470> none<00:04:05.680> and

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
sink i'm going to choose check none and

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.630 
sink i'm going to choose check none and
then<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.640> sink<00:04:06.940> calibration<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.410> now<00:04:09.400> i<00:04:09.430> have

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
then just sink calibration so now i have

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.229 
then just sink calibration so now i have
a<00:04:09.880> base<00:04:10.419> setting<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:12.190> i<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.519> sync<00:04:12.820> from<00:04:12.970> one

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
a base setting that i can sync from one

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.509 
a base setting that i can sync from one
image<00:04:13.449> to<00:04:13.600> another<00:04:13.840> group<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.949> images<00:04:15.340> i

didn't change locations and whatnot but
I<00:04:27.010> now<00:04:27.310> have<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.550> solid<00:04:27.970> base<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:28.960> can<00:04:29.169> start

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
I now have a solid base that I can start

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.030 
I now have a solid base that I can start
from<00:04:30.030> where<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.449> my<00:04:31.870> image<00:04:32.260> actually<00:04:32.530> truly

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
from where the my image actually truly

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.700 
from where the my image actually truly
looks<00:04:33.160> almost<00:04:33.639> exactly<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
looks almost exactly like the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.870 
looks almost exactly like the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
build a custom camera calibration I can

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.409 
build a custom camera calibration I can
still<00:04:43.510> use<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.620> enhancement<00:04:45.280> card<00:04:45.460> too<00:04:45.940> warm

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
still use the enhancement card too warm

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.570 
still use the enhancement card too warm

designed<00:05:08.950> for<00:05:09.780> landscapes<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:11.020> personally<00:05:11.740> I

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
designed for landscapes but personally I

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.710 
designed for landscapes but personally I
actually<00:05:12.039> use<00:05:12.340> all<00:05:12.760> of<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.389> different

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
this patch and you'll see if I use the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.469 
this patch and you'll see if I use the
backslash<00:05:29.919> key<00:05:29.979> you<00:05:30.639> can<00:05:30.669> see<00:05:31.000> clearly<00:05:31.030> the

backslash key you can see clearly the

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.860 
backslash key you can see clearly the
different<00:05:31.900> sets<00:05:32.110> before<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.770> say<00:05:32.979> after<00:05:33.280> and

I<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:35.110> go<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.590> other<00:05:35.710> side<00:05:36.479> for<00:05:37.479> slightly

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
I can go to the other side for slightly

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.490 
I can go to the other side for slightly
less<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.919> an<00:05:39.039> effect<00:05:39.160> if<00:05:39.550> you<00:05:39.580> will<00:05:39.849> and<00:05:40.500> again

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
less of an effect if you will and again

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.610 
less of an effect if you will and again
before<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.820> after<00:05:43.539> I<00:05:43.720> can<00:05:44.229> take<00:05:44.440> these

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
before and after I can take these

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.890 
before and after I can take these
settings<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.400> can<00:05:45.639> sync<00:05:46.300> these<00:05:46.479> like<00:05:46.750> we

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
settings and I can sync these like we

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.480 
settings and I can sync these like we

whole<00:05:48.700> set<00:05:48.940> of<00:05:49.030> images<00:05:49.180> but<00:05:50.050> it's<00:05:50.169> giving<00:05:50.349> me

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
whole set of images but it's giving me

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.129 
whole set of images but it's giving me
complete<00:05:50.950> creative<00:05:51.669> control<00:05:51.789> over<00:05:52.419> the
