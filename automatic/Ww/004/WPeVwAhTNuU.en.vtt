both<00:00:46.380> sides<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.710> craftsmen<00:00:47.010> okay<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
both sides are craftsmen okay so the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.290 
both sides are craftsmen okay so the
brush<00:00:48.450> need<00:00:48.720> naturally<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
brush need naturally we have to

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.670 
brush need naturally we have to
application<00:00:51.300> meeting<00:00:51.720> in<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> brush<00:00:58.230> knee

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
application meeting in the brush knee

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
application meeting in the brush knee
actually<00:00:59.040> we<00:00:59.960> okay<00:01:00.990> English<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:02.370> transmit<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
actually we okay English we transmit to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually we okay English we transmit to
brush<00:01:03.720> and<00:01:04.500> push<00:01:06.140> Chinese<00:01:14.810> okay

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
brush and push Chinese okay

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
brush and push Chinese okay
the<00:01:16.200> invasion<00:01:16.650> never<00:01:16.830> transmitted<00:01:17.369> through

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the invasion never transmitted through

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480 
the invasion never transmitted through
these<00:01:17.729> parts<00:01:18.090> enough<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> Lamar<00:01:20.070> coming

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
these parts enough which is Lamar coming

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:44.889 
these parts enough which is Lamar coming
to<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:21.060> okay<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:41.690> you<00:01:42.690> know<00:01:42.840> keep<00:01:43.200> twisting

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
to me okay this you know keep twisting

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.249 
to me okay this you know keep twisting
take<00:01:45.899> down<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.860> I'll<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.550> step<00:01:47.940> back<00:01:48.259> which

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
take down and I'll come step back which

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
take down and I'll come step back which
is<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.070> step<00:01:50.429> back<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.869> move<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.640> move

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
is this step back you move so they move

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.430 
is this step back you move so they move
this<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.500> black<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.550> opponent's<00:02:03.060> weight

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
this and black the opponent's weight

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.740 
this and black the opponent's weight
that's<00:02:04.440> why

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.540 

music<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> English<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.520> don't

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
music but the English they don't

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.690 
music but the English they don't
translate<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:15.150> classic<00:02:16.490> how<00:02:17.490> they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
translate very much so classic how they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.530 
translate very much so classic how they
use<00:02:18.000> brush<00:02:18.690> knee<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.990> push<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.330> come<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
use brush knee and push which is come to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.920 
use brush knee and push which is come to
me<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.960> deflect<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:25.370> pulling<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.550> side

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
me to deflect and pulling to the side

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.560 
me to deflect and pulling to the side
now<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> kind<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.270> strike

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
now is it kind of like strike

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
now is it kind of like strike
you<00:02:30.930> should<00:02:31.260> strike<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.060> general

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you should strike so this is general

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190 
you should strike so this is general
idea<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.640> other<00:02:35.970> side<00:02:36.330> when<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.020> are

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
idea and the other side when you are

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.610 
idea and the other side when you are
coming<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.490> always<00:02:39.270> see<00:02:39.720> upper<00:02:40.320> parts

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
coming to you you always see upper parts

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.810 
coming to you you always see upper parts
team<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.130> deflect<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:44.100> deflect

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
team that deflect this is deflect

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.070 
team that deflect this is deflect
meaning<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.660> could<00:02:45.840> observe<00:02:46.610> deflect<00:02:47.870> push<00:02:49.640> or

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
meaning we could observe deflect push or

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.030 
meaning we could observe deflect push or
deflect<00:02:52.080> push<00:02:53.420> whole<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.890> have<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
deflect push whole so if you have a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:06.039 
deflect push whole so if you have a
circle<00:02:56.610> too<00:02:56.790> flat

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.190 

any<00:03:06.650> nonfiction

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:25.920 

oh<00:03:17.910> right<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.180> okay<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:24.569> when<00:03:25.569> we<00:03:25.720> are

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
oh right here okay so when we are

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
oh right here okay so when we are
circled<00:03:26.590> down<00:03:26.730> Circle<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:27.910> we<00:03:28.569> both<00:03:28.870> gave<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
circled down Circle up we both gave the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.520 
circled down Circle up we both gave the
deflection<00:03:30.550> meaning<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.330> example<00:03:31.750> when<00:03:32.260> he's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
deflection meaning for example when he's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.830 
deflection meaning for example when he's
tacking<00:03:33.099> positions<00:03:34.030> up<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.349> use<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:37.599> do

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
tacking positions up and use this to do

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.009 
tacking positions up and use this to do
it<00:03:38.019> but<00:03:38.680> even<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.160> honored<00:03:39.640> good<00:03:40.510> damage

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
it but even I have honored good damage

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.030 
it but even I have honored good damage
it<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.010> now<00:03:42.870> that's<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.080> deflection

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it so now that's the deflection

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.210 
it so now that's the deflection
so<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.489> dancer<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:47.319> different<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so you dancer to different the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.580 
so you dancer to different the
opponent's<00:03:48.730> energy<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.660> side<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.440> which

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
opponent's energy to the side so which

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.259 
opponent's energy to the side so which
is<00:03:50.769> our<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.989> lower<00:03:52.989> also<00:03:53.620> can<00:03:53.890> go

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
is our can go lower also can go

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.949 
is our can go lower also can go
definitely

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
definitely

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.190 
definitely
okay<00:03:56.860> so<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.160> depends<00:03:57.579> our<00:03:57.849> homeless<00:03:58.660> position

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
okay so it depends our homeless position

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.309 
okay so it depends our homeless position
is<00:03:59.349> a<00:03:59.380> top<00:03:59.860> port<00:04:00.579> down<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:01.299> leave<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.690> down<00:04:02.019> we

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
is a top port down to leave that down we

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:16.920 
is a top port down to leave that down we
do<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.650> side<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.849> this<00:04:04.329> side<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.510> that's<00:04:16.720> why

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
do this side and this side so that's why

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.920 
do this side and this side so that's why
I<00:04:17.200> don't<00:04:17.620> want<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.100> use<00:04:18.280> black<00:04:18.609> arm<00:04:18.910> circle<00:04:19.750> too

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
I don't want to use black arm circle too

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.969 
I don't want to use black arm circle too
much<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> side

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
much to the side

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:28.690 
much to the side
I<00:04:21.010> need<00:04:21.720> front

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.160 

and<00:04:29.700> even<00:04:30.240> when<00:04:30.420> we<00:04:30.450> do<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> connection

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
and even when we do the connection

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.620 
and even when we do the connection
movement<00:04:31.830> from<00:04:32.100> here<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.270> thing<00:04:33.450> too

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
movement from here and one thing too

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:54.450 
movement from here and one thing too
much<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.020> side<00:04:34.490> because

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.520 

you
