00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.960
 chocolate 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.249
 to start in a bowl of electric fences we mix the games 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.909
 with sugar 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 and beat until the mixture that mounted and double the volume 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.270
 it has to stay sparkling 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 we add lanata 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 then we add the oil 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.230
 add little by little to the egg mixture 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.120
 and with a spatula we make enveloping movements so that the mixture does not 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 come down 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 we add what we have left 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.810
 this step is better to do it little by little so that there are not many lumps 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.579
 and in silicone molds we agree our cupcake capsules 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.740
 with a pastry bag 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 we will remove half of the mixture 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.439
 we cut the tip 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.379
 and fill the capsules 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.379
 almost entirely 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.079
 sprinkle with a little sugar on top 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.669

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.639
 we mix everything very well 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 and then harvest in a pastry bag 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.579
 the weapon subtracts preheated to 230 degrees 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.209
 filled with capsules 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.029
 and has done more for a few nuggets more over the primaries 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.549
