00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.529
 you will find out 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.970
 gearbox with depths right now 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.740
 installed on the glass so -called 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.300
 the mandrel base is 409 mend my 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.650
 squandered beforehand for so much 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 stopped and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.899
 7516 here is such a mandrel it is installed 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 the gearbox is fixed and now we will 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.590
 to bore bearing seats 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 on the nuts 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 twist 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.469
 scientists 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.469
 milking 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 Yes, and the cover released 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.200
 our task 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.939
 why? 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.939
 stretching between bearings 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.460
 from 16 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.960
 started once. 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.210
 try you . 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.210
 five 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.260
 by myself 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.630
 but also 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.020
 walls of dollars 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.300
 she by name 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.470
 im like tristan either 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 Now I have these gifts 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.290
 so finish repairing the alarm clock nuts 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.180
 such two glasses are made as 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.580
 subspecies shelves for what 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:03.210
 dragged his place under the bearing on 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.160
 third to 2 millimeters to the side from a4 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.790
 militare on diameter made here such 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.600
 bushings 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.150
 now we just put a clip on them 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.450
 Bearing for volumes bag is made 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.770
 in such a way that the back part was made 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.990
 would be a bead uporchik 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.220
 little proponent so he sat down in this 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.580
 radius to 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.050
 the thing couldn't get off the mobage 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.830
 and a book like this 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.830
 raw 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:48.330
 we score the landing without giving 5 everything so we 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:50.400
 make a monolith as you leave both will 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.289
 assume that the bearing diameter is just 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.270
 changed here she is strong 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:06:00.919
 right now everything is like that after how long 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.909
 we have a special correction that went 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.909
 slaughter again 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.430
 wrote this 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.919
 everything is ready now you just need 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.319
 Now insert in gear but this already 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:40.550
 will make a master aggregator who will 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:43.560
 assemble the gearbox itself now we put 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.560
 under it fix with the sleeve in place 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.009
 we release the drag bolts a little nut 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.520
 we have it tightened like this 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:55.770
 just for myself there is now no 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.740
 no ellipse cones instead 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.030
 bearings love bearing after 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.220
 working bearing 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.880
 even if the place seems to be not developed 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.449
 but when after measurements there are 2 to 3 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.599
 tenths for each gearbox 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:16.860
 take second place the same 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:19.639
 copper and and release the bolts and mods 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.639
 gone again 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:34.440
 sappers all now 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:37.900
 then we will not bolt everything 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.440
 bearing sits dead nut too nut 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.420
 clamped 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.420
 and bearing simultaneously 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.540
 all public bought
