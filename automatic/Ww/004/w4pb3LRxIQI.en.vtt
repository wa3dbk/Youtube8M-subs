00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
cars great around 400 yeah all right

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.280 
cars great around 400 yeah all right
this<00:00:58.860> is<00:00:59.010> incredibly<00:00:59.579> impressive

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.870 

going<00:01:03.920> around<00:01:04.010> some<00:01:04.810> twisties<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.880> definitely

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
going around some twisties it definitely

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.180 
going around some twisties it definitely
performs<00:01:08.330> well

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
performs well

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.060 
performs well
and<00:01:10.730> I<00:01:11.060> thought<00:01:11.330> already<00:01:11.630> ya<00:01:12.070> see

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
and I thought already ya see

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.650 
and I thought already ya see
acceleration<00:01:13.790> after<00:01:14.510> up<00:01:14.630> 40<00:01:15.230> is<00:01:16.390> lacking<00:01:17.390> a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
acceleration after up 40 is lacking a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.020 
acceleration after up 40 is lacking a
little<00:01:17.930> bit<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:19.010> turbocharged<00:01:19.640> engine

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
little bit it's a turbocharged engine

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.620 
little bit it's a turbocharged engine
too<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:20.510> it's<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:21.440> kind<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.740> PE<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
too so it's it's kind of PE you have to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.080 
too so it's it's kind of PE you have to
be<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.170> upper<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.340> can't<00:01:25.670> have<00:01:25.820> be<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
be in the upper you can't have be in the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.340 
be in the upper you can't have be in the
middle<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.390> rev<00:01:26.570> range<00:01:26.600> for<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.200> get

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
middle of the rev range for it to get

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.560 
middle of the rev range for it to get
any<00:01:27.500> real<00:01:27.710> power<00:01:27.980> definitely<00:01:28.640> with<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> 1.8

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
any real power definitely with a 1.8

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.620 
any real power definitely with a 1.8
liter<00:01:29.900> engine<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.500> lotta<00:01:31.180> yeah<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:32.450> not

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
liter engine it a lotta yeah it's not

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.090 
liter engine it a lotta yeah it's not
the<00:01:32.780> most<00:01:32.930> powerful<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.590> putting<00:01:33.920> liter

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the most powerful and putting liter

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.420 
the most powerful and putting liter
turbo

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.600 

the<00:01:42.760> first<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.210> second<00:01:43.600> poll<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:44.020> pretty

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the first the second poll is pretty

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
the first the second poll is pretty
impressive<00:01:45.610> actually

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.680 

and<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.770> grips<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:51.030> around<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.600> think

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
and it grips really all around I think

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.690 
and it grips really all around I think
it<00:01:52.020> feels<00:01:52.380> faster<00:01:53.010> than<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it feels faster than it actually is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.490 
it feels faster than it actually is
which<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.150> always<00:01:54.330> good<00:01:54.690> in<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> car<00:01:55.200> yeah

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
which is always good in the car yeah

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.740 
which is always good in the car yeah
it's<00:01:56.010> more<00:01:56.130> fun<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.760> Less<00:01:57.210> manager<00:01:57.690> and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
it's more fun for Less manager and

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
it's more fun for Less manager and
smaller<00:02:00.750> engine<00:02:01.290> means<00:02:02.250> better<00:02:02.520> gas<00:02:02.729> mileage

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
smaller engine means better gas mileage

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.480 
smaller engine means better gas mileage
yes<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.619> tell<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.979> friends<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.400> a
