00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
this is actually the symphysis map it'll

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.140 
this is actually the symphysis map it'll
get<00:03:38.409> molded<00:03:38.799> with<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.280> lot<00:03:39.639> of<00:03:39.760> stuff<00:03:39.970> all

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
get molded with a lot of stuff all

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.089 
get molded with a lot of stuff all
across<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> map<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.349> you<00:03:41.379> can<00:03:41.680> see<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:41.949> right

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
across the map and you can see it right

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.009 
across the map and you can see it right
eh<00:03:42.340> really<00:03:42.639> cool<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.299> we're<00:03:43.419> going<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.690> move<00:03:43.870> on

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
eh really cool so we're going to move on

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.430 
eh really cool so we're going to move on
to<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.409> model<00:03:44.739> mob<00:03:44.919> drops<00:03:45.389> now<00:03:46.389> with<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:47.019> wither

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
to the model mob drops now with a wither

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.860 
to the model mob drops now with a wither
boss<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.489> this<00:03:48.909> may<00:03:49.060> preclude<00:03:49.209> some<00:03:49.510> models

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
boss so this may preclude some models

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.559 
boss so this may preclude some models
wither<00:03:50.109> skeleton<00:03:50.769> which<00:03:51.729> dropped<00:03:52.060> custom

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
wither skeleton which dropped custom

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.629 
wither skeleton which dropped custom
items<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.739> kill<00:03:53.949> them<00:03:54.099> enjoy<00:03:54.370> playing

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
items when you kill them enjoy playing

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.119 
items when you kill them enjoy playing
so<00:03:54.909> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.150> watch<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.889> showcase<00:03:56.889> video

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
so you can watch the showcase video

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.309 
so you can watch the showcase video
right<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.370> audios<00:03:58.000> messed<00:03:58.269> up<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:59.049> it

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
right here audios messed up but it

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.710 
right here audios messed up but it
doesn't<00:03:59.620> matter<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.239> yeah<00:04:01.239> it's<00:04:01.419> really<00:04:01.629> cool

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
doesn't matter and yeah it's really cool

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.770 
doesn't matter and yeah it's really cool
to<00:04:01.900> modern<00:04:02.440> map<00:04:02.620> with<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.669> modern<00:04:04.150> way<00:04:04.750> to

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
to modern map with a modern way to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.689 
to modern map with a modern way to
scatter<00:04:05.109> than<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.349> think<00:04:05.620> which<00:04:06.190> is<00:04:06.220> pretty

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
scatter than I think which is pretty

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.899 
scatter than I think which is pretty
hurt<00:04:07.510> defeat<00:04:08.229> because<00:04:08.859> it's<00:04:09.129> modded<00:04:09.639> and<00:04:09.729> it's

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
hurt defeat because it's modded and it's

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.849 
hurt defeat because it's modded and it's
really<00:04:10.150> strong<00:04:10.389> so<00:04:10.449> let's<00:04:10.900> undo<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.379> last<00:04:11.590> map

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
really strong so let's undo the last map

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.280 
really strong so let's undo the last map
which<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.190> another<00:04:12.549> molded<00:04:13.000> map<00:04:13.209> but<00:04:14.169> it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
which is another molded map but it

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.360 
which is another molded map but it

automatically also download you can
always<00:04:16.060> download<00:04:16.209> maps<00:04:16.630> oh<00:04:16.780> don't<00:04:17.019> worry

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
about that this is not a modern map

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.759
