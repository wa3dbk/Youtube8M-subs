00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
video guys I kind of want to just use

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
video guys I kind of want to just use
this<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.009> almost<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.430> background<00:01:41.970> music<00:01:42.450> or

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
this as almost like background music or

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
this as almost like background music or
background<00:01:43.290> video<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.740> guess<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
background video I guess because what I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
background video I guess because what I
really<00:01:44.939> want<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> talk<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.869> actually

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
really want to talk about is actually

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260 
really want to talk about is actually
kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.189> idea<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.729> been<00:01:47.880> trying<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
kind of an idea that I've been trying to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.520 
kind of an idea that I've been trying to
come<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.990> trying<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> figure<00:01:49.470> out

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
come up with and trying to figure out

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
come up with and trying to figure out
how<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.189> implement<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
how I can actually implement this and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
how I can actually implement this and
have<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.869> fun<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> don't

some of the games i participate in the
tournament<00:02:30.110> myself<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.890> little<00:02:30.980> bit<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.430> didn't

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
tournament myself a little bit I didn't

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.280 
tournament myself a little bit I didn't
even<00:02:32.000> get<00:02:32.180> first<00:02:32.390> rounded<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> actually<00:02:32.930> won<00:02:33.260> I

comfortable with a hundred thousand
coins<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.290> think<00:04:21.470> that's<00:04:21.710> pretty<00:04:21.890> fair<00:04:22.010> at<00:04:22.370> this

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490

coins I think that's pretty fair at this
point<00:04:22.730> I<00:04:22.790> don't<00:04:22.820> think<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:23.210> too<00:04:23.390> much

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
point I don't think it's too much

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.820

as the competitive world of madden has
to<00:05:53.480> do<00:05:53.600> with<00:05:53.750> just<00:05:53.960> you<00:05:54.230> know<00:05:54.350> playing

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
to do with just you know playing

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.220

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
exhibition games one-on-one online and

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.710 
exhibition games one-on-one online and
to<00:05:57.770> me<00:05:57.919> I<00:05:57.950> just<00:05:58.160> I<00:05:58.490> don't<00:05:59.060> really<00:05:59.270> think<00:05:59.390> that

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
to me I just I don't really think that

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.360 
to me I just I don't really think that
it's<00:05:59.870> that<00:06:00.020> exciting<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:00.710> reason<00:06:00.980> that<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.100> say

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
it's that exciting the reason that I say

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.100 
it's that exciting the reason that I say
that<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.669> because<00:06:01.700> pretty<00:06:02.450> much<00:06:02.540> everybody

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
that is because pretty much everybody

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.170 
that is because pretty much everybody
uses<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.470> freaking<00:06:03.860> Seahawks<00:06:04.250> I'm<00:06:04.550> lying<00:06:04.940> if

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
uses the freaking Seahawks I'm lying if

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.940 
uses the freaking Seahawks I'm lying if
you've<00:06:05.600> ever<00:06:05.780> played<00:06:06.020> online<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.860> that's

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
you've ever played online and that's

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.320 
you've ever played online and that's
just<00:06:07.160> because<00:06:07.340> their<00:06:07.640> defense<00:06:08.030> is<00:06:08.150> so

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
just because their defense is so

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.820 
just because their defense is so
overpowered<00:06:08.990> they've<00:06:09.380> got<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.620> mobile

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
overpowered they've got a mobile

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.140 
overpowered they've got a mobile
quarterback<00:06:10.340> they<00:06:10.520> have<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:10.700> great<00:06:10.940> running

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
quarterback they have a great running

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.570 
quarterback they have a great running
back<00:06:11.419> so<00:06:12.020> you<00:06:12.530> know<00:06:12.620> playing<00:06:12.860> ultimate<00:06:13.070> team<00:06:13.460> I

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
back so you know playing ultimate team I

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.100 
back so you know playing ultimate team I
think<00:06:13.610> is<00:06:13.880> going<00:06:14.090> to<00:06:14.210> really<00:06:14.390> expand<00:06:14.840> that<00:06:14.990> and

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
think is going to really expand that and

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.930 
think is going to really expand that and
I<00:06:15.200> feel<00:06:15.680> like<00:06:15.710> madness<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.550> kind<00:06:16.760> of<00:06:16.790> game
