keeping your ATP stores high because

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.690 
keeping your ATP stores high because
when<00:01:17.320> you're<00:01:17.470> lifting<00:01:17.680> heavy<00:01:18.040> you're

primarily using your ATP creatine system

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.090 
primarily using your ATP creatine system
and<00:01:21.400> then<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.180> move<00:01:22.390> into<00:01:22.570> glycolysis<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.620> by

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
and then you move into glycolysis so by

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.430 
and then you move into glycolysis so by
keeping<00:01:24.520> your<00:01:24.730> creatine<00:01:25.180> levels<00:01:25.450> high<00:01:25.780> you're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
keeping your creatine levels high you're

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.870 
keeping your creatine levels high you're
going<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.800> be<00:01:26.890> increasing<00:01:27.670> your<00:01:27.760> strength

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
basically over time so number one

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.450 
basically over time so number one
supplement<00:01:30.640> creaking<00:01:31.360> get<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.560> and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
supplement creaking get that and and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.070 
supplement creaking get that and and
then<00:01:34.000> if<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.180> want<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.450> indulge<00:01:34.660> in<00:01:34.900> something

else you can start going into things

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.020 
else you can start going into things
like<00:01:37.680> glutamine<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:39.490> know<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.670> can<00:01:39.880> have

like glutamine you know you can have

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.000 
like glutamine you know you can have
that<00:01:40.240> five<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.660> ten<00:01:40.780> grams<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.170> day<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.620> this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
that five to ten grams a day and this

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.770 
that five to ten grams a day and this
helps<00:01:42.280> with<00:01:42.400> recovery<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:43.000> helps<00:01:43.240> bolster

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
helps with recovery it helps bolster

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.960 
helps with recovery it helps bolster
your<00:01:44.140> immune<00:01:44.410> system<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.520> also<00:01:45.640> helps

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
your immune system and it also helps

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
with other things like you know muscle

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.410 
with other things like you know muscle
fullness<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.120> pumps<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.610> next<00:01:52.000> thing<00:01:52.150> would

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
fullness it pumps then next thing would

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.290 
fullness it pumps then next thing would
be<00:01:52.600> branched<00:01:53.530> chain<00:01:53.710> amino<00:01:53.740> acids<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:55.180> can

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
be branched chain amino acids you can

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.790 
be branched chain amino acids you can
take<00:01:55.480> them<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.750> pill<00:01:56.020> form<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.410> can<00:01:56.530> pick<00:01:56.680> em

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
take them in pill form you can pick em

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.280 
take them in pill form you can pick em
in<00:01:56.920> powder<00:01:57.130> form<00:01:57.250> doesn't<00:01:58.030> really<00:01:58.330> matter<00:01:58.600> but

in powder form doesn't really matter but

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.280 
in powder form doesn't really matter but
it's<00:01:59.620> important<00:02:00.070> before<00:02:00.250> T<00:02:00.640> train<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.290> also

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
it's important before T train and also

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.680 
it's important before T train and also
during<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:02.770> training<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.400> if<00:02:04.270> you're<00:02:04.450> doing

during your training and if you're doing

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.030 
during your training and if you're doing
cardio<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.230> you're<00:02:05.320> dieting<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.800> could<00:02:05.950> do

cardio and you're dieting you could do
it<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.370> can<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.700> also<00:02:07.510> before<00:02:07.930> your

it you can have it also before your
cardio<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.399> would<00:02:09.580> recommend<00:02:09.700> having<00:02:10.090> five

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
cardio and I would recommend having five

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.290

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to ten grams of that per day it's very

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.630 
to ten grams of that per day it's very
important<00:02:13.719> to<00:02:13.749> get<00:02:13.930> your<00:02:13.959> V<00:02:14.170> cas<00:02:14.590> because<00:02:15.040> they

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
important to get your V cas because they

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.230 
important to get your V cas because they
are<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.999> three<00:02:16.359> amino<00:02:17.140> acids

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240

way you can test that out is by putting

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
food where a multivitamin will help but

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.500 
food where a multivitamin will help but
this<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:27.960> coming<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.320> whole

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
this is coming in whole

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.290 

same<00:04:31.510> thing<00:04:31.660> here<00:04:31.840> spirulina<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:33.000> has<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> lot

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
same thing here spirulina it has a lot

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.210 
same thing here spirulina it has a lot
of<00:04:34.330> antioxidants<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.710> can<00:04:35.860> use<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.040> as

of antioxidants and you can use it as

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.440 
of antioxidants and you can use it as
the<00:04:36.340> veggies<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:39.460> that'll<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.970> second-last

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
the veggies and that'll the second-last

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.810 
the veggies and that'll the second-last
supplement<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.980> would<00:04:42.190> recommend<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.790> a

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
supplement that I would recommend is a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.600 
supplement that I would recommend is a
glucose<00:04:43.270> amine<00:04:43.570> complex<00:04:44.320> because<00:04:45.100> that<00:04:45.460> helps

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
glucose amine complex because that helps

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.820 
glucose amine complex because that helps
with<00:04:45.970> lifting<00:04:46.870> heavy<00:04:47.080> weights<00:04:47.170> all<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.650> time

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
with lifting heavy weights all the time

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.240 
with lifting heavy weights all the time

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
supplement and I recommend that most

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.100 
supplement and I recommend that most
people<00:05:14.830> take<00:05:14.950> at<00:05:15.190> least<00:05:15.610> 40<00:05:15.970> grams<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.330> day<00:05:16.360> you

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110

don't have to take 40 grams a day of
supplemental<00:05:19.050> fiber<00:05:20.050> but<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:21.460> can<00:05:21.580> add<00:05:21.790> to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
supplemental fiber but it can add to

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.790 
supplemental fiber but it can add to
