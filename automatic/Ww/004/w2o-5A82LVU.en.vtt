well this is the BMW 3-series 890 and
what<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:05.879> gonna<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> look<00:00:06.420> at<00:00:06.569> right

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
what we're gonna have a look at right

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.259 
what we're gonna have a look at right
now<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.290> diagnosing<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.250> fault<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> vehicle

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
now is diagnosing a fault on the vehicle

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.230 
now is diagnosing a fault on the vehicle
which<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:10.130> apparently<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.190> well<00:00:11.519> known<00:00:11.790> fault

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
which is apparently a well known fault

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.620 
which is apparently a well known fault
within<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.929> van<00:00:13.230> off<00:00:13.440> system<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.360> it's

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
within the van off system it is the it's

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.130 
within the van off system it is the it's
called<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.929> VVT<00:00:16.680> motor<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.279> Valvetronic<00:00:18.140> more

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
called a VVT motor to Valvetronic more

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.880 
called a VVT motor to Valvetronic more
there<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.350> something<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> effect

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
there was something to that effect

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.330 
there was something to that effect
basically<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.460> scan<00:00:24.119> tool<00:00:24.390> here

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
basically we have the scan tool here

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.890 
basically we have the scan tool here
which<00:00:26.340> will<00:00:26.550> tell<00:00:26.820> us<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> exact<00:00:27.599> fault

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
which will tell us what the exact fault

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.529 
which will tell us what the exact fault
code<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> problem<00:00:29.340> is

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
code is and where the problem is

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
code is and where the problem is
permitting<00:00:30.980> I'm<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.130> gonna<00:00:32.219> click<00:00:32.520> OK<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
directly below this video and I would

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
directly below this video and I would
say<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.899> absolutely<00:00:40.440> perfect<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
say it's absolutely perfect and a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
say it's absolutely perfect and a
lifesaver<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.910> anyone<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> BMW<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> we've

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
lifesaver for anyone with a BMW so we've

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.520 
lifesaver for anyone with a BMW so we've
got<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> 3-series<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:47.090> okay<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.530> we're

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
got the 3-series here okay to that we're

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
got the 3-series here okay to that we're
in<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.980> ninety<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.629> for

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in a ninety but it's also the same for

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
in a ninety but it's also the same for
91<00:00:52.320> 92<00:00:52.710> 93

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
91 92 93

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
91 92 93
so<00:00:54.300> we'll<00:00:54.449> okay<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> driver

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
so we'll okay to that and in the driver

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
so we'll okay to that and in the driver
now<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> engine<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.859> DME<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.590> gonna

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
now the engine is the DME so we're gonna

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
now the engine is the DME so we're gonna
click<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.030> we're<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.480> read

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
click on that and we're just gonna read

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.590 
click on that and we're just gonna read
the<00:01:03.989> fault<00:01:04.229> codes<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.909> gives<00:01:06.210> us<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the fault codes that gives us a bit of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.590 
the fault codes that gives us a bit of
vehicle<00:01:07.290> information<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.299> that's<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
vehicle information and that's going to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.649 
vehicle information and that's going to
ask<00:01:09.720> us<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> read<00:01:10.320> trouble<00:01:10.799> code<00:01:14.270> okay<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
ask us to read trouble code okay so the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.530 
ask us to read trouble code okay so the
one<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:15.960> looking<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.799> -<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
one we're looking at right here is - a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
one we're looking at right here is - a
6-1<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.500> involved<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> tronic<00:01:20.580> adaption

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
6-1 and it's involved a tronic adaption

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.859 
6-1 and it's involved a tronic adaption
and<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:22.409> might<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.189> codes

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
and there might be some other codes

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
and there might be some other codes
which<00:01:24.869> relate<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.740> Valvetronic<00:01:26.400> system

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
which relate to the Valvetronic system

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.719 
which relate to the Valvetronic system
here<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> code<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:29.700> been

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
here but that's the code that has been

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.480 
here but that's the code that has been
constant<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> no<00:01:31.799> matter<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.130> many<00:01:32.250> times

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
constant and no matter how many times

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
constant and no matter how many times
you<00:01:32.640> erase<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.150> code<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.689> code<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.229> still

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you erase that code that code will still

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460 
you erase that code that code will still
keep<00:01:34.799> coming<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.810> because<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.049> quite<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
keep coming back because it is quite a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.399 
keep coming back because it is quite a
serious<00:01:37.740> fault<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.540> point<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.170> it

which<00:02:46.200> point<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.590> would<00:02:46.709> imagine<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.280> will

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
which point I would imagine it will

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.440 
which point I would imagine it will
still<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.790> under<00:02:47.879> warranty<00:02:49.790> but<00:02:50.790> there<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.120> go

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
still be under warranty but there we go

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.250 
still be under warranty but there we go
so<00:02:51.569> this<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> tool<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.560> say<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:54.260> c-110

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
so this is the tool as I say it's c-110

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.979 
so this is the tool as I say it's c-110
