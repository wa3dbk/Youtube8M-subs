00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
yes going to own sting ray here comes

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.150 
yes going to own sting ray here comes
the<00:00:12.929> Tiberian<00:00:13.410> refinery<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:14.960> sorry<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.139> mine

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.019 

the<00:00:20.160> jab<00:00:20.490> should<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.939> shooting<00:00:24.769> okay<00:00:25.769> well<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the jab should be shooting okay well I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
the jab should be shooting okay well I
thought<00:00:27.750> mateesah<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> upper<00:00:28.560> hand<00:00:28.769> he

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
thought mateesah to upper hand he

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.259 
thought mateesah to upper hand he
probably<00:00:29.099> does<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:29.609> he<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.060> four

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
probably does because he has four

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.569 
probably does because he has four
refineries<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.250> big<00:00:32.460> an

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
refineries but it's not that big an

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
refineries but it's not that big an
advantage<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:34.040> his<00:00:35.040> legs<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:36.079> got

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
advantage because his legs has got

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
advantage because his legs has got

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.569 

and<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:13.799> indicators<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:16.039> as<00:01:17.039> Lexus<00:01:19.579> ok

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
and these indicators are as Lexus ok

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.520 
and these indicators are as Lexus ok
he's<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.689> Lex<00:01:21.960> Devlin<00:01:22.229> got<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> air

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
he's as Lex Devlin got the air

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.209 
he's as Lex Devlin got the air
superiority<00:01:22.939> there's<00:01:23.939> no<00:01:24.060> doubt<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
superiority there's no doubt about that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.419 
superiority there's no doubt about that
even<00:01:26.219> though<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.490> bullfrogs<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:27.179> here<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
even though these bullfrogs are here I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.730 
even though these bullfrogs are here I
think<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.610> indicators<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.380> much<00:01:31.469> go

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
think the indicators will pretty much go

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.080 
think the indicators will pretty much go
right<00:01:31.920> past<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.369> without<00:01:32.670> too<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.479> damage

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
right past them without too much damage

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.059 
right past them without too much damage
so<00:01:36.090> yeah<00:01:36.959> I<00:01:36.990> don't<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:38.179> lexus<00:01:39.860> yeah<00:01:40.860> he's

to<00:02:45.540> pump<00:02:45.989> out<00:02:46.170> units<00:02:46.829> basically<00:02:47.639> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
to pump out units basically and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.099 
to pump out units basically and
overwhelm<00:02:49.650> him<00:02:50.450> kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.510> steam<00:02:51.750> roll<00:02:51.930> them

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
overwhelm him kind of steam roll them

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.300 
overwhelm him kind of steam roll them
could<00:02:52.380> say<00:02:53.209> steamrolling<00:02:54.209> meaning<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:56.099> build

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
could say steamrolling meaning you build

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
could say steamrolling meaning you build
a<00:02:56.430> massive<00:02:56.639> units<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.959> slowly<00:02:58.470> but

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
a massive units and you just slowly but

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.289 
a massive units and you just slowly but
steadily<00:02:58.950> roll<00:02:59.250> over<00:02:59.489> your<00:02:59.579> opponent<00:03:00.000> hence

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
steadily roll over your opponent hence

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.900 
steadily roll over your opponent hence
the<00:03:00.419> name<00:03:00.569> steamroller<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:02.220> think<00:03:02.489> that's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the name steamroller and I think that's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.659 
the name steamroller and I think that's
what<00:03:03.319> it's<00:03:04.319> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> happen<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:05.099> Oh<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.579> do

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
what it's going to happen but Oh what do

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:06.860

Akula sub finally or not finally but
yeah<00:04:10.840> nice<00:04:11.620> counter<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> Riptide<00:04:12.580> in<00:04:13.090> case

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
yeah nice counter to the Riptide in case

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.450 
yeah nice counter to the Riptide in case
you<00:04:13.540> don't<00:04:13.930> know<00:04:14.050> this<00:04:14.320> these<00:04:15.280> are<00:04:15.400> the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
you don't know this these are the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.130 
you don't know this these are the
coolest<00:04:15.670> getting<00:04:15.910> ripped<00:04:16.060> can<00:04:16.840> take<00:04:16.989> these

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
coolest getting ripped can take these

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.910 
coolest getting ripped can take these
rip<00:04:17.320> tides<00:04:17.530> or<00:04:17.680> rip<00:04:18.220> up<00:04:18.400> these<00:04:18.730> riptides<00:04:19.270> apart

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
rip tides or rip up these riptides apart

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.300 
rip tides or rip up these riptides apart
so<00:04:21.780> that's<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.590> get<00:04:23.680> owned<00:04:23.920> fairly

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
so that's going to get owned fairly

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.450 
so that's going to get owned fairly
quickly<00:04:24.520> but<00:04:25.530> his<00:04:26.530> words<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.950> sub<00:04:27.130> going

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
quickly but his words is sub going

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.050 
quickly but his words is sub going
always<00:04:28.450> waiting<00:04:28.750> for<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.990> for<00:04:29.080> bullfrogs<00:04:30.060> yes

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
always waiting for it for bullfrogs yes

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.820 
always waiting for it for bullfrogs yes
that's<00:04:31.450> probably<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.930> good<00:04:31.990> idea<00:04:32.140> but<00:04:32.530> right

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that's probably a good idea but right

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.370 
that's probably a good idea but right
now<00:04:32.980> I<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.220> want<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.940> kill<00:04:34.540> those<00:04:34.750> bullfrogs

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
now I just want to kill those bullfrogs

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.590 
now I just want to kill those bullfrogs

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
keys it's a really really good idea to

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.490 
keys it's a really really good idea to
do<00:05:23.220> because<00:05:24.220> that<00:05:24.970> means<00:05:25.090> your<00:05:25.300> units<00:05:25.660> they

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
do because that means your units they

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.670 
do because that means your units they
won't<00:05:26.680> just<00:05:27.180> sit<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.450> mean<00:05:29.110> they'll<00:05:29.230> move<00:05:29.440> to

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
won't just sit I mean they'll move to

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.370 
won't just sit I mean they'll move to
the<00:05:29.800> area<00:05:29.979> like<00:05:30.460> they'll<00:05:31.020> tell<00:05:32.020> them<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.260> move

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
the area like they'll tell them to move

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.690 
the area like they'll tell them to move
over<00:05:32.530> here<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.919> move<00:05:33.070> over<00:05:33.220> here<00:05:33.250> but<00:05:33.580> if

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
over here the move over here but if

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.520 
over here the move over here but if
they're<00:05:33.970> engaged<00:05:34.390> any<00:05:34.630> hostile<00:05:35.200> units

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
they're engaged any hostile units

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.760 
they're engaged any hostile units
they'll

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
they'll

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.189 
they'll
engage<00:05:36.009> them<00:05:36.280> while<00:05:36.580> they're<00:05:36.819> moving<00:05:37.199> that's

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
engage them while they're moving that's

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.150 
engage them while they're moving that's
really<00:05:38.410> good<00:05:38.590> because<00:05:38.650> if<00:05:38.919> you<00:05:38.979> just

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
really good because if you just

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.240 
really good because if you just
right-click<00:05:39.580> they<00:05:39.729> won't<00:05:39.910> attack<00:05:40.030> anything

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
right-click they won't attack anything

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.790 
right-click they won't attack anything
unless<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:43.060> micromanage<00:05:43.690> them<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.409> you<00:05:44.650> want

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
unless you micromanage them and you want

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.309 
unless you micromanage them and you want
to<00:05:44.889> keep<00:05:44.979> my<00:05:45.190> crowing<00:05:45.490> to<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.639> minimum<00:05:46.090> as<00:05:46.930> much

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
to keep my crowing to a minimum as much

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.629 
to keep my crowing to a minimum as much
as<00:05:47.349> possible<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:48.009> mean<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.310> will<00:05:48.430> have<00:05:48.550> to

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
as possible I mean you will have to

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.790 
as possible I mean you will have to
micro-units<00:05:49.120> but<00:05:49.509> it's<00:05:49.750> nice<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.229> them

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
micro-units but it's nice to have them

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.930 
micro-units but it's nice to have them
do<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.159> work<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.990> here's<00:05:53.169> a<00:05:53.259> nice<00:05:53.610> nice<00:05:54.610> mix<00:05:54.849> of

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
do the work so here's a nice nice mix of

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.399 
do the work so here's a nice nice mix of
units<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.539> subs<00:05:55.780> will<00:05:55.960> keep<00:05:56.110> out<00:05:56.259> the

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
units the subs will keep out the

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.619 
units the subs will keep out the
riptides<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.979> choppers<00:05:57.370> will<00:05:57.639> you<00:05:58.030> know<00:05:58.120> take

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
riptides the choppers will you know take

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.200 
riptides the choppers will you know take
a<00:05:58.659> powder<00:05:59.250> ground<00:06:00.250> units<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.789> mix<00:06:01.060> will

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
a powder ground units and the mix will

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.240 
a powder ground units and the mix will
take<00:06:01.360> care<00:06:01.509> of<00:06:01.569> air<00:06:01.780> as<00:06:01.990> will<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.740> bullfrogs

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
take care of air as will the bullfrogs

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.140 
take care of air as will the bullfrogs
23<00:06:03.580> bullfrogs<00:06:04.199> but<00:06:05.199> I<00:06:05.710> don't<00:06:06.669> think<00:06:06.849> he<00:06:06.970> has

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
23 bullfrogs but I don't think he has

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.029 
23 bullfrogs but I don't think he has
enough<00:06:07.180> units<00:06:07.840> because<00:06:09.090> he<00:06:10.090> needs<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:11.169> don't

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
enough units because he needs to I don't

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.390 
enough units because he needs to I don't
know<00:06:12.099> I<00:06:12.340> think<00:06:12.940> he's<00:06:13.620> going<00:06:14.620> to<00:06:17.069> see<00:06:18.069> what<00:06:18.250> he's

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
know I think he's going to see what he's

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.649 
know I think he's going to see what he's
doing<00:06:18.460> he's<00:06:18.849> going<00:06:19.000> for<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.210> battle<00:06:19.419> base

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
doing he's going for a battle base

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:20.909 
doing he's going for a battle base
upgrade<00:06:20.110> which<00:06:20.259> means<00:06:20.470> he's<00:06:20.560> going<00:06:20.650> to<00:06:20.740> build

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
upgrade which means he's going to build

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.399 
upgrade which means he's going to build
here<00:06:21.099> three<00:06:21.310> units<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:22.690> i<00:06:22.720> think<00:06:22.810> i'm<00:06:23.020> guessing

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
here three units so i think i'm guessing

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.529 
here three units so i think i'm guessing
he's<00:06:23.530> gonna<00:06:23.620> go<00:06:23.800> for<00:06:23.979> some<00:06:24.099> v<00:06:24.220> tues<00:06:24.539> some

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
he's gonna go for some v tues some

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.629 
he's gonna go for some v tues some
apocalypse<00:06:26.080> tanks<00:06:26.380> maybe<00:06:26.560> I<00:06:26.860> haven't<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.490> have

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
apocalypse tanks maybe I haven't I have

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.820 
apocalypse tanks maybe I haven't I have
seen<00:06:27.880> that<00:06:28.030> before<00:06:28.150> from<00:06:28.659> from<00:06:29.169> matey's<00:06:29.500> so<00:06:29.770> it

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
seen that before from from matey's so it

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.180 
seen that before from from matey's so it
wouldn't<00:06:30.099> surprise<00:06:30.159> me<00:06:30.400> I<00:06:31.740> was<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.770> nice

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
wouldn't surprise me I was a nice

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.730 
wouldn't surprise me I was a nice
stunned<00:06:33.639> by<00:06:33.819> that<00:06:33.849> doggie<00:06:34.300> but<00:06:34.810> oh<00:06:34.990> he<00:06:35.560> got

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
stunned by that doggie but oh he got

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.820 
stunned by that doggie but oh he got
owned<00:06:36.159> the<00:06:36.280> doggie<00:06:36.490> as<00:06:36.819> to<00:06:37.300> when<00:06:37.539> you<00:06:38.500> see<00:06:38.680> what

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
owned the doggie as to when you see what

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.529 
owned the doggie as to when you see what
a<00:06:38.860> problem<00:06:39.159> it<00:06:39.460> is<00:06:39.490> taking<00:06:40.300> over<00:06:40.330> this

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
a problem it is taking over this

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.200 
a problem it is taking over this
building<00:06:41.039> so<00:06:42.039> it's<00:06:42.190> really<00:06:42.340> good<00:06:42.610> of<00:06:42.759> like

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
building so it's really good of like

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.249 
building so it's really good of like
stuff<00:06:43.419> taking<00:06:43.690> this<00:06:43.780> over<00:06:44.020> from<00:06:44.169> the

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
stuff taking this over from the

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.629 
stuff taking this over from the
beginning<00:06:44.349> that's<00:06:44.949> actually<00:06:45.190> quite<00:06:45.250> a<00:06:45.370> gutsy

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
beginning that's actually quite a gutsy

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.300 
beginning that's actually quite a gutsy
move<00:06:45.849> but<00:06:46.330> it's<00:06:46.599> pretty<00:06:46.719> smart<00:06:47.110> and<00:06:47.349> I<00:06:48.069> want<00:06:48.250> to

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
move but it's pretty smart and I want to

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.159 
move but it's pretty smart and I want to
try<00:06:48.430> to<00:06:48.490> do<00:06:48.580> that<00:06:48.759> when<00:06:49.479> I<00:06:49.509> play<00:06:49.750> against<00:06:50.050> the

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
try to do that when I play against the

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.260
