has<00:02:31.900> an<00:02:32.140> accelerometer<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:34.180> works<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.689> few

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
has an accelerometer it works with a few

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.559 
has an accelerometer it works with a few
applications<00:02:36.010> where<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.000> could<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.269> tilt

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
applications where you could just tilt

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.990 
applications where you could just tilt
it<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.829> would<00:02:38.950> switch<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.579> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it and it would switch like that and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.789 
it and it would switch like that and
generally<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.049> would<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.409> open<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.709> the

generally you would have to open up the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.339 
generally you would have to open up the
QWERTY<00:02:42.069> keyboard<00:02:42.459> for<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.909> work<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:44.200> now

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
QWERTY keyboard for that to work but now

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.920 
QWERTY keyboard for that to work but now
it<00:02:44.590> works<00:02:45.189> just<00:02:45.310> by<00:02:45.519> tilting<00:02:46.389> it<00:02:46.569> just<00:02:46.810> like

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
it works just by tilting it just like

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.190 
it works just by tilting it just like
that<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:47.230> some<00:02:47.440> applications<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.129> on<00:02:48.250> 2.1

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that and some applications but on 2.1

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.199 
that and some applications but on 2.1
did<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.379> as<00:02:50.530> well<00:02:50.889> but<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.489> only<00:02:51.639> did<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
did that as well but it only did it to

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.479 
did that as well but it only did it to
the<00:02:52.299> left<00:02:52.620> now<00:02:54.900> there<00:02:55.900> we<00:02:56.019> go<00:02:56.139> it<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:57.099> do<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.400> to

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
the left now there we go it can do it to

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.670 
the left now there we go it can do it to
the<00:02:57.579> right<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:57.909> well<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.290> that's<00:02:59.470> another

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
the right as well so that's another
