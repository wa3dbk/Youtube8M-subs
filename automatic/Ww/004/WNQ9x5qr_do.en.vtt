one of the difficulties of surviving in

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.059 
one of the difficulties of surviving in
the<00:00:03.179> subarctic<00:00:03.540> forest<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.680> lack<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
the subarctic forest is the lack of

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.789 
the subarctic forest is the lack of
sustaining<00:00:05.940> plant<00:00:06.240> foods<00:00:06.589> historically<00:00:07.589> the

had to rely on meat called either by
hunting<00:00:12.389> or<00:00:12.570> trapping<00:00:16.039> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.220> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> be

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
hunting or trapping this is going to be

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.480 
hunting or trapping this is going to be
a<00:00:17.699> squirrel<00:00:18.180> trap<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.470> last<00:00:19.710> resort<00:00:19.890> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
a squirrel trap it's a last resort but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.340 
a squirrel trap it's a last resort but
if<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.180> travel<00:00:21.420> deep<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.170> wilderness

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
if you travel deep into the wilderness

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
if you travel deep into the wilderness
like<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.609> should<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.060> how<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.269> feed

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
like this you should know how to feed

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.580 
like this you should know how to feed
yourself<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:26.609> split<00:00:26.939> log<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> form

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
yourself the split log is going to form

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400 
yourself the split log is going to form
the<00:00:28.769> bottom<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.849> top<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.810> trap<00:00:31.170> which

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the bottom and the top of a trap which

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.459 
the bottom and the top of a trap which
kills<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:31.890> crushing<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:33.300> hold<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> open<00:00:33.809> I've

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
kills by crushing to hold it open I've

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.580 
kills by crushing to hold it open I've
made<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> trigger<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.820> three<00:00:36.120> sticks<00:00:36.590> two

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
made a trigger out of three sticks two

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.799 
made a trigger out of three sticks two
of<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.950> form<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.290> hinge<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.530> upright<00:00:40.950> support

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
of them form a hinge to upright support

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
of them form a hinge to upright support
they<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> last

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
they go in there like that and the last

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.500 
they go in there like that and the last
stick<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.280> fine<00:00:47.610> trigger<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
stick is the very fine trigger that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
stick is the very fine trigger that
holds<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.710> locked<00:00:49.980> position<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
holds that in the locked position and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.380 
holds that in the locked position and
it's<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> bait<00:00:53.390> at

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it's on there that I put the bait at

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
it's on there that I put the bait at
this<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.930> year<00:00:54.960> red<00:00:55.590> squirrels<00:00:55.949> are

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this time of year red squirrels are

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
this time of year red squirrels are
drying<00:00:56.430> mushrooms<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> branches<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
drying mushrooms in the branches of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
drying mushrooms in the branches of
trees<00:00:57.840> prior<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> storing<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
trees prior to storing them for the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
trees prior to storing them for the
winter<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.449> I've<00:01:00.570> taken<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> their

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
winter so I've taken one of their

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
winter so I've taken one of their
mushrooms<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.100> put<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> trigger<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
mushrooms and put it on the trigger of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800 
mushrooms and put it on the trigger of
the<00:01:03.690> trap<00:01:04.460> I've<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> trap<00:01:06.360> itself

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the trap I've also put the trap itself

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
the trap I've also put the trap itself
up<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> branches<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> trees<00:01:08.670> because

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
up in the branches of the trees because

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
up in the branches of the trees because
red<00:01:09.270> squirrels<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> spend<00:01:10.470> much

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
red squirrels don't like to spend much

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
red squirrels don't like to spend much
time<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> ground<00:01:11.750> when<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> squirrel

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
time on the ground when the squirrel

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
time on the ground when the squirrel
comes<00:01:13.320> along<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> move<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.220> mushroom<00:01:14.610> he'll

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
comes along to move that mushroom he'll

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.320 
comes along to move that mushroom he'll
dislodge<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> trigger<00:01:16.110> stick<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> crunch

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
dislodge the trigger stick and crunch

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
dislodge the trigger stick and crunch
there's<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.080> meal<00:01:21.619> there<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.740> lots<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> wild

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
there's your meal there are lots of wild

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
there's your meal there are lots of wild
fungi<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:24.000> found<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> forest<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
fungi to be found in the forest at the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.249 
fungi to be found in the forest at the
moment<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.850> useful

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
moment they can be really useful

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.240 
moment they can be really useful
improving<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> flavor<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.430> wild<00:01:29.790> foods

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
improving the flavor of other wild foods

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
improving the flavor of other wild foods
but<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> eat<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> poisonous<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:34.229> give

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but if you eat a poisonous one we give

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
but if you eat a poisonous one we give
yourself<00:01:34.770> zero<00:01:35.070> chances<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> survival<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.750> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
yourself zero chances of survival so if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
yourself zero chances of survival so if
you're<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.200> play<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.950> make

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you're going to play with these make

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.050 
you're going to play with these make
sure<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.270> proper<00:01:39.540> training
