I<00:00:00.140> am<00:00:01.140> Paul<00:00:02.300> Lord<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.230> jungle

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I am Paul Lord of the jungle

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.280 
I am Paul Lord of the jungle
this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.609> our<00:00:05.730> steampunk<00:00:06.150> rocket<00:00:07.109> mass<00:00:07.259> heater

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this is our steampunk rocket mass heater

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.580 
this is our steampunk rocket mass heater
for<00:00:07.830> experimenters<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:09.389> we've<00:00:09.599> got<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.530> kinds

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
for experimenters so we've got all kinds

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.789 
for experimenters so we've got all kinds
of<00:00:11.429> crazy<00:00:11.670> experiments<00:00:12.630> built<00:00:12.900> into<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
of crazy experiments built into this and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.340 
of crazy experiments built into this and
we<00:00:14.460> keep<00:00:14.670> making<00:00:14.940> modifications<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.230> over

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
we keep making modifications to it over

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.010 
we keep making modifications to it over
and<00:00:16.440> over<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.650> over<00:00:16.740> again<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.670> try<00:00:17.810> new<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and over and over again to try new and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.189 
and over and over again to try new and
different<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.760> actual<00:00:21.720> wood<00:00:21.930> feat

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
different things the actual wood feat

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
different things the actual wood feat
starts<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.010> Eddy<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.910> height<00:00:24.300> right

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
starts on this Eddy this height right

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.630 
starts on this Eddy this height right
here<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.140> added<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.859> thing<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
here but we added this thing on to it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.019 
here but we added this thing on to it
which<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.180> call<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.570> bubble<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
which we call the bubble and then the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.540 
which we call the bubble and then the
bubble<00:00:30.420> went<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:31.050> part<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.800> external

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
bubble went on as part of the external

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.510 
bubble went on as part of the external
air<00:00:33.059> intake<00:00:33.680> which<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> decided

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
air intake which we kind of decided

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.350 
air intake which we kind of decided
external<00:00:36.239> air<00:00:36.420> intake<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> stupid<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> we'll

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
external air intake is stupid so we'll

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360 
external air intake is stupid so we'll
take<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.379> off<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.280> all

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
take this all off but right now it's all

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
take this all off but right now it's all
plugged<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.149> ever<00:00:42.270> use<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.140> awful

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
plugged we don't ever use it it's awful

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.520 
plugged we don't ever use it it's awful
but<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.309> bubble<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.379> order

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
but the bubble that we put in in order

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
but the bubble that we put in in order
to<00:00:46.680> work<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> external<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.579> air<00:00:47.670> intake

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to work with the external and air intake

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
to work with the external and air intake
turned<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.170> awesome

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
turned out to be awesome

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.450 
turned out to be awesome
so<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.440> puff<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> smoke<00:00:52.920> tries<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so if a little puff of smoke tries to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
so if a little puff of smoke tries to
come<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> top<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> fire<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
come out of the top of the fire a lot of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
come out of the top of the fire a lot of
times<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> gets<00:00:55.860> sucked<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.820> just

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
times it gets sucked back in or just

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
times it gets sucked back in or just
mostly<00:00:57.449> sucked<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
mostly sucked back in but with the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
mostly sucked back in but with the
bubble<00:00:59.039> around<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> smoke<00:01:00.600> might

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bubble around it that the smoke might

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
bubble around it that the smoke might
try<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> come<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.280> it'll<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.760> get

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
try to come up but then it'll all get

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270 
try to come up but then it'll all get
sucked<00:01:03.329> back<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.809> every<00:01:04.379> time<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.920> never

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
sucked back in every time so we never

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.190 
sucked back in every time so we never
smell<00:01:05.670> any<00:01:05.850> smoke

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
smell any smoke

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.810 
smell any smoke
so<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.560> bubble<00:01:08.100> turned<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
so this bubble turned out to be really

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
so this bubble turned out to be really
cool

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
cool

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050 
cool
back<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:10.049> we've<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> bypass<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.880> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
back here we've got a bypass so we can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990 
back here we've got a bypass so we can
bypass<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.930> mass<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.189> thought<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.939> would

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bypass the mass so we thought that would

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
bypass the mass so we thought that would
make<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.570> easier<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> start<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
make it so be easier to start but that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.649 
make it so be easier to start but that
turned<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:18.000> make<00:01:18.180> any<00:01:18.210> difference

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
turned out to not make any difference

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.590 
turned out to not make any difference
whatsoever<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.340> discovered<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
whatsoever but what we discovered is is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.130 
whatsoever but what we discovered is is
that<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.950> activate<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.850> bypass<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.930> then

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that if we activate the bypass so then

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
that if we activate the bypass so then
the<00:01:25.830> exhaust<00:01:26.340> coming<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.060> goes<00:01:27.270> directly

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the exhaust coming in here goes directly

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.870 
the exhaust coming in here goes directly
outside<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> bypasses<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> mass

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
outside and it bypasses the mass

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270 
outside and it bypasses the mass
and<00:01:30.969> then<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.600> mire<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.350> like<00:01:32.560> ending<00:01:33.130> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
and then the mire is like ending and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.670 
and then the mire is like ending and
it's<00:01:33.369> down<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.729> just<00:01:33.909> some<00:01:34.060> coals<00:01:34.469> then<00:01:35.469> we<00:01:35.560> can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
it's down to just some coals then we can

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.440 
it's down to just some coals then we can
activate<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.310> bypass<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:36.759> then<00:01:37.090> all<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
activate the bypass and then all the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.120 
activate the bypass and then all the
exhaust<00:01:37.750> goes<00:01:37.930> straight<00:01:38.140> up<00:01:38.200> site<00:01:38.500> bypassing

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
exhaust goes straight up site bypassing

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.480 
exhaust goes straight up site bypassing
the<00:01:39.220> mass<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:41.140> we<00:01:41.320> benefit<00:01:42.100> from<00:01:42.130> that

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
the mass and what we benefit from that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.469 
the mass and what we benefit from that
is<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:45.039> don't<00:01:45.369> do<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.880> then<00:01:46.360> it

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
is is that if we don't do it then it

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.690 
is is that if we don't do it then it
runs<00:01:46.689> all<00:01:47.110> night<00:01:47.380> long<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.770> keeps<00:01:47.979> moving<00:01:48.250> air

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
runs all night long it keeps moving air

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.399 
runs all night long it keeps moving air
through<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> system<00:01:49.299> including<00:01:49.869> through<00:01:50.049> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
through the system including through the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.139 
through the system including through the
mass<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.189> takes<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.579> heat<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.939> mass

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
mass so it takes the heat of the mass

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.169 
mass so it takes the heat of the mass
outside<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.369> if<00:01:54.429> we<00:01:54.520> activate<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.030> bypass

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
outside so if we activate the bypass

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.450 
outside so if we activate the bypass
towards<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.899> end<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> burn<00:01:56.429> then<00:01:57.429> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
towards the end of the burn then the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.660 
towards the end of the burn then the
heat<00:01:58.179> stays<00:01:58.840> here<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.920> heats<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.429> room

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
heat stays here and heats the room

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.850 
heat stays here and heats the room
rather<00:02:01.299> than<00:02:01.420> being<00:02:01.659> pulled<00:02:01.960> outside<00:02:02.140> this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
rather than being pulled outside this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.859 
rather than being pulled outside this
guillotine<00:02:03.250> gets<00:02:03.880> used<00:02:04.149> all<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.450> time<00:02:04.659> now

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
guillotine gets used all the time now

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.949 
guillotine gets used all the time now
and<00:02:05.319> what<00:02:05.920> happens<00:02:06.099> is<00:02:06.429> is<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.610> if<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.720> fire

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
and what happens is is that if the fire

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.490 
and what happens is is that if the fire
is<00:02:07.990> dun<00:02:08.679> dun<00:02:09.099> da<00:02:09.280> dun<00:02:09.399> dun<00:02:09.640> dun<00:02:10.209> dun<00:02:10.239> we<00:02:11.080> closed

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
is dun dun da dun dun dun dun we closed

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.320 
is dun dun da dun dun dun dun we closed
the<00:02:11.739> bypass<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.580> keeps<00:02:12.819> air<00:02:13.060> from

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the bypass and that keeps air from

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030 
the bypass and that keeps air from
moving<00:02:13.569> outside<00:02:13.870> through<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.470> system<00:02:14.799> we

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
moving outside through the system we

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880 
moving outside through the system we
also<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.580> tried<00:02:15.880> multiple<00:02:16.680> exits<00:02:17.680> through

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
also have tried multiple exits through

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.589 
also have tried multiple exits through
the<00:02:18.040> wall<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.519> can<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.819> there's<00:02:19.420> another

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the wall so you can see there's another

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.030 
the wall so you can see there's another
exit<00:02:20.080> back<00:02:20.260> here<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:20.709> through<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
exit back here to go out through the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.670 
exit back here to go out through the
wall<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:22.000> height<00:02:22.329> there's<00:02:22.930> another<00:02:23.380> one

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
wall at this height there's another one

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.610 
wall at this height there's another one
that<00:02:24.120> goes<00:02:25.120> out<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.540> wall<00:02:25.720> down<00:02:25.989> there

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
that goes out the wall down there

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.050 
that goes out the wall down there
and<00:02:26.920> there<00:02:27.099> used<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.790> went<00:02:28.000> at

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and there used to be one that went at

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.940 
and there used to be one that went at
the<00:02:28.180> wall<00:02:28.329> through<00:02:28.540> there<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.620> we've<00:02:29.769> made

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the wall through there so we've made

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.039 
the wall through there so we've made
lots<00:02:30.220> lots<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.700> modifications<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.480> try<00:02:31.810> and

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
lots lots of modifications to try and

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.620 
lots lots of modifications to try and
see<00:02:32.250> how<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.239> wall<00:02:34.420> low

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
see how it is it going at the wall low

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.750 
see how it is it going at the wall low
going<00:02:35.200> out<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> wall<00:02:35.739> high<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.370> through<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
going out the wall high or through the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.030 
going out the wall high or through the
roof<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.750> gotta<00:02:37.900> tell<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.230> through<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
roof and I gotta tell you through the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.309 
roof and I gotta tell you through the
roof<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> best<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.120> basically<00:02:41.019> if<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.200> go

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
roof is the best so basically if you go

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.500 
roof is the best so basically if you go
through<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.799> roof<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.310> end<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.940> with<00:02:43.150> two

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
through the roof you end up with two

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.080 
through the roof you end up with two
thermo<00:02:43.989> siphon<00:02:44.230> pumps<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:45.370> inside<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
thermo siphon pumps one inside the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.539 
thermo siphon pumps one inside the
barrel<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.980> rocket<00:02:48.430> mass

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
barrel and this one this rocket mass

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.110 
barrel and this one this rocket mass
heater<00:02:48.579> uses<00:02:49.450> our<00:02:49.750> pebble<00:02:50.350> system<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.910> rather

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
heater uses our pebble system so rather

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.840 
heater uses our pebble system so rather
than<00:02:52.359> being<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.630> big<00:02:52.870> con<00:02:53.170> mass<00:02:53.560> then<00:02:54.340> we've<00:02:54.639> got

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
than being a big con mass then we've got

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.199 
than being a big con mass then we've got
two<00:02:55.410> circles<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.530> duct<00:02:56.769> going<00:02:57.220> inside<00:02:57.819> here

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
two circles of duct going inside here

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.729 
two circles of duct going inside here
and<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.480> filled<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.139> with<00:02:59.260> rocks<00:02:59.530> and

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
and we just filled up with rocks and

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.129 
and we just filled up with rocks and
pebbles<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.299> little<00:03:01.510> bit<00:03:01.750> different

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
pebbles so it's a little bit different

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.140 
pebbles so it's a little bit different
and<00:03:02.260> we've<00:03:02.410> discovered<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.760> pebble

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
and we've discovered then the pebble

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.930 
and we've discovered then the pebble
style<00:03:04.510> while<00:03:05.410> being<00:03:05.590> very<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.250> portable<00:03:06.579> we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
style while being very very portable we

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.580 
style while being very very portable we
can<00:03:07.090> take<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.329> all<00:03:07.569> part<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.019> about<00:03:08.230> an<00:03:08.350> hour

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
can take this all part in about an hour

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.259 
can take this all part in about an hour
and<00:03:09.010> rebuild<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.459> somewhere<00:03:09.700> else<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.090> about

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
and rebuild it somewhere else in about

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.539 
and rebuild it somewhere else in about
an<00:03:10.420> hour<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.889> can't<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.340> with<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
an hour and you can't do that with the

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.830 
an hour and you can't do that with the
comp<00:03:12.760> systems<00:03:13.180> but<00:03:13.389> we<00:03:13.450> found<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.750> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
comp systems but we found that the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.349 
comp systems but we found that the
pebble<00:03:14.109> system<00:03:14.380> while<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.709> works<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:16.209> works

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
pebble system while it works it works

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.750 
pebble system while it works it works
about<00:03:16.569> its<00:03:16.810> third<00:03:17.230> as<00:03:17.530> well<00:03:17.859> as<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> cob<00:03:18.459> based

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
about its third as well as a cob based

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.490 
about its third as well as a cob based
system<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> nice<00:03:20.019> thing<00:03:20.049> with<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
system but the nice thing with the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.840 
system but the nice thing with the
pebble<00:03:20.680> system<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.519> whenever<00:03:21.670> we

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
pebble system is is that whenever we

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.300 
pebble system is is that whenever we
want<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.510> can<00:03:22.660> change<00:03:23.019> all<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> stuff

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
want to we can change all of the stuff

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.750 
want to we can change all of the stuff
that<00:03:24.459> we've<00:03:24.579> got<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:25.120> anytime

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that we've got going on anytime

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
that we've got going on anytime
right<00:03:27.240> now<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.660> thing<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.230> hot<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.800> don't

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
right now this thing is so hot I don't

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.500 
right now this thing is so hot I don't
want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.310> any<00:03:29.490> closer<00:03:29.730> than<00:03:30.000> about<00:03:30.210> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
want to get any closer than about this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.110 
want to get any closer than about this
it's<00:03:30.780> putting<00:03:30.990> out<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.470> much<00:03:31.680> heat<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.610> you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's putting out so much heat and you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.810 
it's putting out so much heat and you
can<00:03:33.300> feel<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.170> lot<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.890> heat<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.490> pebbles

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
can feel a lot of heat on the pebbles

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.150 
can feel a lot of heat on the pebbles
right<00:03:36.000> now<00:03:36.210> so<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:40.110> then<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.740> touch<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
right now so and then if you touch the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.740 
right now so and then if you touch the
cleanouts<00:03:41.550> they're<00:03:41.850> very<00:03:42.060> very<00:03:42.240> very<00:03:42.420> hot

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
cleanouts they're very very very hot

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.470 
cleanouts they're very very very hot
right<00:03:43.020> now<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.650> found<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:44.580> we<00:03:44.640> use<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
right now we found that when we use the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.830 
right now we found that when we use the
bypass<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> guillotine<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.600> we<00:03:48.600> can

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
bypass and the guillotine that we can

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.440 
bypass and the guillotine that we can
double<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.560> better<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.370> efficiency<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
double or better the efficiency of the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.600 
double or better the efficiency of the
rocket<00:03:51.780> mass<00:03:51.930> heater<00:03:51.960> but<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.920> course<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
rocket mass heater but of course the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.850 
rocket mass heater but of course the
downside<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.900> requires<00:03:55.350> human

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
downside of that is it requires human

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.070 
downside of that is it requires human
discipline<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.330> able<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.570> open<00:03:58.020> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
discipline to be able to open the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.480 
discipline to be able to open the
guillotine<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.680> morning<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.250> if<00:03:59.370> you

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
guillotine in the morning and if you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.370 
guillotine in the morning and if you
don't<00:03:59.790> do<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.200> will<00:04:01.350> be

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
don't do that then there will be

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.190 
don't do that then there will be
disaster<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.940> then<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.240> you<00:04:03.330> forget<00:04:03.720> to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
disaster and then if you forget to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.100 
disaster and then if you forget to
deactivate<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.430> bypass<00:04:05.820> then<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.870> sends

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
deactivate the bypass then it just sends

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.720 
deactivate the bypass then it just sends
all<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.320> heat<00:04:07.650> right<00:04:07.860> outside<00:04:08.280> rather<00:04:08.580> than

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
all the heat right outside rather than

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.470 
all the heat right outside rather than
heating<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.450> mass<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.670> downside<00:04:12.030> of

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
heating the mass so the downside of

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.530 
heating the mass so the downside of
these<00:04:12.780> awesome<00:04:13.350> features<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:14.430> requires<00:04:15.000> human

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
these awesome features is requires human

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.870 
these awesome features is requires human
disciplined<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.830> we<00:04:16.950> also<00:04:17.160> believe<00:04:17.640> that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
disciplined but we also believe that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.610 
disciplined but we also believe that
whereas<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.480> lot<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.140> rocket<00:04:19.440> mass<00:04:19.560> heater

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
whereas a lot of the rocket mass heater

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.100 
whereas a lot of the rocket mass heater
z'<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.400> have<00:04:20.610> are<00:04:21.209> able<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.690> be<00:04:21.900> able<00:04:21.959> to

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
z' that we have are able to be able to

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.740 
z' that we have are able to be able to
heat<00:04:22.440> us<00:04:22.620> space<00:04:22.980> using<00:04:23.880> one<00:04:24.300> tenth<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.690> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
heat us space using one tenth of the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.850 
heat us space using one tenth of the
wood<00:04:25.280> these<00:04:26.280> two<00:04:26.670> features<00:04:26.960> will<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.830> than

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
wood these two features will more than

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.610 
wood these two features will more than
double<00:04:29.070> back<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.120> then<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:31.170> might<00:04:31.320> know<00:04:31.470> but

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
double back so then you might know but

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.920 
double back so then you might know but
get<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.830> down<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.010> one<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.640> one<00:04:32.850> T<00:04:33.060> ahthe<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
get it down to one to one T ahthe of the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.250 
get it down to one to one T ahthe of the
wood<00:04:34.110> may<00:04:34.710> be<00:04:34.770> even<00:04:35.070> better
