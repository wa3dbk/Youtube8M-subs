00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
hello again one and a half weeks into

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.330 
hello again one and a half weeks into
the<00:03:12.790> prep<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.269> diet<00:03:14.190> everything<00:03:15.190> is

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the prep and the diet everything is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.009 
the prep and the diet everything is
going<00:03:15.610> fine<00:03:16.290> weight<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.879> 76<00:03:18.879> kg<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.720> I've

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
going fine weight is 76 kg so I've

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.330 
going fine weight is 76 kg so I've
dropped<00:03:22.230> kilos<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.370> last<00:03:24.550> week<00:03:24.910> or<00:03:25.120> so

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
dropped kilos in the last week or so

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.589 
dropped kilos in the last week or so
which<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.370> fine<00:03:27.700> because<00:03:27.849> most<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.480> was

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
which is fine because most of it was

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.030 
which is fine because most of it was
probably<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:28.989> water<00:03:29.319> from<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> excess

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
probably just water from the excess

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.120 
probably just water from the excess
carbs<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> sweets<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.920> food

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
carbs and in the sweets and the food

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.289 
carbs and in the sweets and the food
nobody<00:03:33.580> foods<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.480> ate<00:03:35.140> before<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.519> started

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
nobody foods that I ate before I started

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.500 
nobody foods that I ate before I started
the<00:03:37.420> prime<00:03:37.920> um<00:03:38.920> had<00:03:39.730> picked<00:03:40.000> up<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.299> tooth

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the prime um had picked up a tooth

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.270 
the prime um had picked up a tooth
infection<00:03:40.750> which<00:03:41.560> doesn't<00:03:41.920> really<00:03:42.040> help

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
infection which doesn't really help

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800 
infection which doesn't really help
because<00:03:42.370> I'm<00:03:42.730> back<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> antibiotics

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
because I'm back on the antibiotics

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.559 
because I'm back on the antibiotics
again<00:03:44.140> which<00:03:45.010> helps<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.610> pain<00:03:45.790> was

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
again which helps with the pain was

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.479 
again which helps with the pain was
obviously<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.260> doesn't<00:03:47.530> help<00:03:47.709> with<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.950> food

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
obviously it doesn't help with the food

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.569 
obviously it doesn't help with the food
absorption<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.260> hope<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.220> gonna<00:03:51.400> be

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
absorption so I hope it's gonna be

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.979 
absorption so I hope it's gonna be
alright<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.880> only<00:03:52.209> for<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.510> week<00:03:52.720> and

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
alright it's only for a week and

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.170 
alright it's only for a week and
hopefully<00:03:53.709> we'll<00:03:53.950> clear<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.190> as<00:03:54.519> well<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:54.970> I

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
hopefully we'll clear it as well so I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.440 
hopefully we'll clear it as well so I
won't<00:03:55.660> need<00:03:55.810> any<00:03:56.049> more<00:03:56.290> treatments<00:03:58.950> yes<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.190> saw

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.920 
things are at the moment with the weight
loss<00:04:08.849> although<00:04:09.849> I'm<00:04:10.120> holding<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.599> little<00:04:10.750> bit

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
loss although I'm holding a little bit

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.160 
loss although I'm holding a little bit
of<00:04:11.019> water<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.650> in<00:04:12.430> certain<00:04:12.700> areas<00:04:13.269> because<00:04:13.959> of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
of water and in certain areas because of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.920 
of water and in certain areas because of
the<00:04:14.440> painkillers<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.489> antibiotics<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
the painkillers and the antibiotics so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.069

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
once that's out of the way then

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.430 
once that's out of the way then
everything<00:04:21.010> should<00:04:21.039> be<00:04:21.250> back<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.609> normal
