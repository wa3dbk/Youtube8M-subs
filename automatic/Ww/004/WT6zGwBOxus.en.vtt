00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
about the fact that the pre new 52

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.740 
about the fact that the pre new 52
universe<00:00:03.950> has<00:00:04.950> been<00:00:05.220> confirmed<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:06.150> still

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
universe has been confirmed to still

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:22.519

exist<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> finale<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.990> Superman

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
exist so in the finale of Superman

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.670 
exist so in the finale of Superman
doomed<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.160> Superman<00:00:23.789> doomed<00:00:24.119> number<00:00:24.720> two<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
doomed in Superman doomed number two it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.400 
doomed in Superman doomed number two it
was<00:00:25.859> confirmed<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> final<00:00:27.390> page<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
was confirmed in the final page that the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540 
was confirmed in the final page that the
pre<00:00:28.710> new<00:00:29.070> 52<00:00:29.460> universe<00:00:29.970> still<00:00:31.160> exists<00:00:32.160> there

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
pre new 52 universe still exists there

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310 
pre new 52 universe still exists there
have<00:00:32.640> been<00:00:32.759> hints<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.660> crisis<00:00:34.170> event

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
have been hints about a crisis event

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
have been hints about a crisis event
happening<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> April<00:00:35.399> 2015<00:00:36.200> along<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
happening in April 2015 along with the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
happening in April 2015 along with the
fact<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.340> Blood<00:00:38.700> Moon<00:00:38.969> series

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
fact that there's this Blood Moon series

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
fact that there's this Blood Moon series
coming<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.140> interact<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
coming out that will interact with the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
coming out that will interact with the
multiverse<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.420> pre<00:00:42.629> new<00:00:42.840> 52

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
multiverse so I think the pre new 52

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
multiverse so I think the pre new 52
will<00:00:43.530> probably<00:00:44.010> interact<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.850> either<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
will probably interact in either of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.020 
will probably interact in either of
those<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.620> gets<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.250> excited<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
those but what gets me really excited is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
those but what gets me really excited is
the<00:00:48.180> fact<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.070> didn't

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the fact that it's still there it didn't

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.240 
the fact that it's still there it didn't
die<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.960> many<00:00:52.199> fans<00:00:52.530> were<00:00:52.710> saying<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
die off so many fans were saying that it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
die off so many fans were saying that it
just<00:00:53.489> died<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.960> fans

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
just died off but a lot of fans

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.709 
just died off but a lot of fans
including<00:00:55.890> me<00:00:56.039> hoped<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.480> just

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
including me hoped that it was just

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.560 
including me hoped that it was just
still<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> sleeping<00:01:00.000> now

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
still there just kind of sleeping now

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.689 
still there just kind of sleeping now
while<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> am<00:01:00.949> excited<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> don't

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
while I am excited for this I don't

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 
while I am excited for this I don't
think<00:01:03.329> we'll<00:01:03.510> ever<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> old

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
think we'll ever go back to the old

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
think we'll ever go back to the old
continuity<00:01:05.600> 100%<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.530> be

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
continuity 100% as much as that would be

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100 
continuity 100% as much as that would be
nice<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.510> something<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
nice but I do think something that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
nice but I do think something that
happened<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> golden<00:01:11.369> Silver<00:01:11.880> Age<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
happened in the golden Silver Age of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.260 
happened in the golden Silver Age of
comics<00:01:12.659> might<00:01:12.990> happen<00:01:13.290> once<00:01:13.860> again<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.939> then

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
comics might happen once again back then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
comics might happen once again back then
DC<00:01:15.689> published<00:01:16.049> comics<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.530> both<00:01:16.680> earth<00:01:16.950> 1

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
DC published comics from both earth 1

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
DC published comics from both earth 1
and<00:01:17.549> earth<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:18.060> side-by-side<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.740> was

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and earth two side-by-side but this was

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.219 
and earth two side-by-side but this was
eventually<00:01:20.430> stopped<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.060> crisis<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.720> Infinite

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
eventually stopped in crisis on Infinite

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.109 
eventually stopped in crisis on Infinite
Earths<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> multiverse<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.759> merged

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
Earths where the multiverse was merged

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
Earths where the multiverse was merged
together<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.320> stopped<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.740> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
together it was stopped because very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
together it was stopped because very
frequently<00:01:27.090> writers<00:01:27.659> wouldn't<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.140> which

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
frequently writers wouldn't know which

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.340 
frequently writers wouldn't know which
universe<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.549> character<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.140> you'd

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
universe a character was from so you'd

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
universe a character was from so you'd
occasionally<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> character

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
occasionally just have the character

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
occasionally just have the character
from<00:01:33.090> earth<00:01:33.360> 2<00:01:33.659> strutting<00:01:34.200> their<00:01:34.320> stuff<00:01:34.380> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
from earth 2 strutting their stuff in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.300 
from earth 2 strutting their stuff in
earth<00:01:34.950> 1<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.610> no<00:01:36.240> explanation<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:37.350> given<00:01:37.380> but

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
earth 1 and no explanation was given but

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
earth 1 and no explanation was given but
now<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> technology<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.720> create<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
now we have the technology to create a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
now we have the technology to create a
computer-based<00:01:40.950> database<00:01:41.759> where<00:01:42.390> writers

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
computer-based database where writers

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.389 
computer-based database where writers
could<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.229> type<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> character's<00:01:44.369> name

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
could just type in the character's name

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.050 
could just type in the character's name
and<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.899> earth<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.909> my

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and see which earth they are from so my

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
and see which earth they are from so my
hope<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> DC<00:01:48.960> will<00:01:49.079> published<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> new

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
hope is that DC will published the new

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.340 
hope is that DC will published the new
52<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> old<00:01:50.759> continuity<00:01:51.390> side-by-side

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
52 and the old continuity side-by-side

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
52 and the old continuity side-by-side
but<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> fact<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.299> they

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
but I do not want the fact that they

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
but I do not want the fact that they
could<00:01:54.869> interact<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> core<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
could interact to be the core of them I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
could interact to be the core of them I
just<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> exist<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> their

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just kind of want them to exist in their

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
just kind of want them to exist in their
own<00:01:59.280> universes<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> occasionally<00:02:01.049> interact

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
own universes and occasionally interact

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
own universes and occasionally interact
if<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> story<00:02:02.399> calls<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.810> idea

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
if the story calls for it the other idea

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
if the story calls for it the other idea
that's<00:02:04.350> kind<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> floating<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> two

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that's kind of floating about is the two

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.330 
that's kind of floating about is the two
universes<00:02:06.329> might<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.750> merged<00:02:07.049> together<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:08.280> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
universes might be merged together now I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.130 
universes might be merged together now I
don't<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.629> gonna<00:02:09.869> happen

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
don't really think this is gonna happen

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.130 
don't really think this is gonna happen
because<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.679> would<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> new<00:02:11.370> new<00:02:12.120> 52

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
because that would be like a new new 52

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.589 
because that would be like a new new 52
it's<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.620> too<00:02:13.920> soon<00:02:14.250> however<00:02:14.879> if<00:02:15.209> they<00:02:15.330> did

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
it's just too soon however if they did

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.570 
it's just too soon however if they did
merge<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.110> two<00:02:16.260> universes<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.040> would<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
merge the two universes I would like the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.699 
merge the two universes I would like the
history<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> Titans<00:02:18.599> brought<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:19.080> if

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
history of the Titans brought back if

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.960 
history of the Titans brought back if
you<00:02:19.860> were<00:02:19.950> gonna<00:02:20.099> do<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.459> you'd<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.730> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you were gonna do that you'd have to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.600 
you were gonna do that you'd have to
bring<00:02:21.150> back<00:02:21.330> Tim<00:02:21.720> Drake's<00:02:22.019> old<00:02:22.349> history<00:02:22.890> but

bring back Tim Drake's old history but

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.770 
bring back Tim Drake's old history but
to<00:02:23.640> do<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.000> you'd<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.330> bring<00:02:24.569> back

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to do that you'd have to bring back

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.900 
to do that you'd have to bring back
Stephanie<00:02:25.230> Browns<00:02:25.530> old<00:02:25.830> history<00:02:26.190> which<00:02:26.760> would

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
Stephanie Browns old history which would

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.490 
Stephanie Browns old history which would
mean<00:02:27.060> she'd<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.599> become<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.200> girl

mean she'd have to become that girl
again

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
again

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.559 
again
which<00:02:29.340> would<00:02:29.489> mean<00:02:29.640> Barbara<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:30.269> have<00:02:30.450> to

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
which would mean Barbara would have to

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.539 
which would mean Barbara would have to
stop<00:02:30.870> being<00:02:31.110> Batgirl<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.739> she'll<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.069> Oracle

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
stop being Batgirl and she'll be Oracle

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.100 
stop being Batgirl and she'll be Oracle
again<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.330> they'd<00:02:33.480> also<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.989> give

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
again but they'd also have to give

again but they'd also have to give
Cassie<00:02:34.650> her<00:02:34.920> old<00:02:35.160> origin<00:02:35.549> back<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:35.940> would

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
Cassie her old origin back which would

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059

would mean giving Wonder Woman her old
origin<00:02:40.500> back<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.340> means<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
origin back then it also means that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.250 
origin back then it also means that
you'd<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.120> bring<00:02:42.360> back<00:02:42.480> Nightwing<00:02:43.110> in

you'd have to bring back Nightwing in

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.380 
you'd have to bring back Nightwing in
the<00:02:43.319> position<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.830> Batman<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:44.549> Nightwing

because of his position in the Titans he

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.819 
because of his position in the Titans he

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
would have never given up being a hero

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.620 
would have never given up being a hero
and<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> whole<00:02:50.610> world<00:02:50.849> wouldn't<00:02:51.299> know<00:02:51.420> his

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and the whole world wouldn't know his

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.449 
and the whole world wouldn't know his
identity<00:02:51.780> anymore<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:53.099> then<00:02:53.250> you'd<00:02:53.370> also

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
identity anymore but then you'd also

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.130 
identity anymore but then you'd also
have<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.790> bring<00:02:53.849> back<00:02:54.090> bar<00:02:54.329> alum<00:02:54.780> which<00:02:54.930> means

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
right there because this could go on

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.069 
right there because this could go on
forever<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.430> Titans<00:03:02.910> were<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> very<00:03:03.390> core<00:03:03.780> part

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
forever the Titans were a very core part

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
of the pre new 52 universe and they

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.759 
of the pre new 52 universe and they
haven't<00:03:06.569> been<00:03:06.660> treated<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.260> very<00:03:07.560> cool

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
haven't been treated like a very cool

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.699

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
part of the universe in the new 52 so

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.080 
part of the universe in the new 52 so
it's<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.040> upsetting<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.060> just

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's really upsetting to see them just

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's really upsetting to see them just
kind<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.480> pushed<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.110> sidelines<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.860> the

she<00:03:37.859> was<00:03:37.980> killed<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.489> long<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.730> she<00:03:38.849> was<00:03:38.940> a

she was killed so long as she was a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.300

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
physical corpse the new 52 would

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.150 
physical corpse the new 52 would
continue<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.880> exist<00:03:42.510> do<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.319> feel<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.040> new

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
continue to exist do I feel like the new

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.909 
continue to exist do I feel like the new
52<00:03:44.519> should<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.150> undone<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> best

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
52 should be undone I think the best

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.979 
52 should be undone I think the best
option<00:03:47.340> would<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.639> have<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.120> new<00:03:48.239> 52<00:03:48.599> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
option would be to have the new 52 and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.020 
option would be to have the new 52 and
the<00:03:49.019> old<00:03:49.230> continuity<00:03:49.919> running<00:03:50.250> side<00:03:50.519> by<00:03:50.730> side

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the old continuity running side by side

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.500 
the old continuity running side by side
I<00:03:51.389> said<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.230> 2011<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.639> do<00:03:53.819> think<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.239> far

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
I said that in 2011 I do think it's far

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
I said that in 2011 I do think it's far
too<00:03:54.750> soon<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.169> be<00:03:55.200> restarting<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.190> continuity

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
too soon to be restarting the continuity

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.120 
too soon to be restarting the continuity
again<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.959> only<00:03:58.169> been<00:03:58.380> three<00:03:58.709> or<00:03:58.829> four<00:03:58.889> years
