way<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:27.920> toss<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.519> into<00:02:29.239> your

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
way you can just toss it into your

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.660 
way you can just toss it into your
pocket<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.959> not<00:02:30.709> worry<00:02:31.010> about<00:02:31.129> it

it's<00:02:31.909> also<00:02:32.150> heavier<00:02:32.870> than<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> standard

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.280

here<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.629> can<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:11.930> what<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.139> actually

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
here so we can see what it actually

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.890 
here so we can see what it actually
looks<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.669> has<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:13.879> touch<00:03:14.239> screen<00:03:14.720> which

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
looks like it has a touch screen which

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.809 
looks like it has a touch screen which
is<00:03:15.049> used<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.500> many<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.010> games<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.459> not<00:03:16.609> all

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
is used in many of the games but not all

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.240 
is used in many of the games but not all
of<00:03:16.970> them<00:03:17.169> therefore<00:03:18.169> when<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.379> played<00:03:18.799> video

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
to play it was never a bragging contest

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.220 
to play it was never a bragging contest
about<00:03:32.720> graphics<00:03:33.440> or<00:03:33.680> 3d<00:03:34.720> okay<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:35.870> turned<00:03:36.109> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
about graphics or 3d okay we turned it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.140 
about graphics or 3d okay we turned it
off<00:03:36.379> change<00:03:36.919> color<00:03:37.160> balance<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.790> let's<00:03:37.940> take

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
off change color balance and let's take

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.509 
off change color balance and let's take
out<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.540> standard<00:03:39.109> old-school<00:03:39.709> Nintendo<00:03:39.889> DS

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
out the standard old-school Nintendo DS

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.720 
out the standard old-school Nintendo DS
game<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.590> insert<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.620> into<00:03:42.949> the<00:03:43.400> back<00:03:43.699> of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
game and insert that into the back of

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.930 
game and insert that into the back of
the<00:03:44.090> 3ds<00:03:45.049> which<00:03:45.799> has<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> much<00:03:46.310> better<00:03:46.489> screen

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
the 3ds which has a much better screen

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.670 
the 3ds which has a much better screen
so<00:03:47.269> every<00:03:47.510> game<00:03:47.629> will<00:03:47.810> be<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> bit<00:03:48.139> sharper<00:03:48.530> on

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
so every game will be a bit sharper on

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.819 
so every game will be a bit sharper on
the<00:03:48.859> 3ds<00:03:49.250> that's<00:03:50.150> how<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.359> standard<00:03:50.840> Nintendo

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
the 3ds that's how a standard Nintendo

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.460 
the 3ds that's how a standard Nintendo

ratio as originally seen on the Nintendo

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.059 
ratio as originally seen on the Nintendo
DS<00:04:04.359> but<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.510> gameplay<00:04:05.750> is<00:04:05.989> exactly<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.859> same

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
DS but the gameplay is exactly the same

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.939 
DS but the gameplay is exactly the same
it<00:04:07.220> just<00:04:07.250> looks<00:04:07.609> sharper<00:04:08.479> so<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.319> 3ds<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.769> a

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
it just looks sharper so the 3ds is a

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.710 
it just looks sharper so the 3ds is a
nice<00:04:10.220> choice<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.790> those<00:04:10.909> looking<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.389> just

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
nice choice for those looking to just

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.319 
nice choice for those looking to just
