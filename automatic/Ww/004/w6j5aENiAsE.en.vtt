00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.100 

okay<00:01:53.910> by<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.120> time<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> other<00:01:54.930> one

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.759 

hey<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:08.599> I<00:02:08.780> guess<00:02:08.959> once<00:02:09.170> he<00:02:09.289> was<00:02:09.379> down<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.739> his

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
hey so I guess once he was down to his

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.050 
hey so I guess once he was down to his
last<00:02:10.009> cup<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.759> body<00:02:11.150> comes<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:12.940> not<00:02:13.940> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
last cup is the body comes out not that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.280 
last cup is the body comes out not that
that<00:02:14.120> makes<00:02:14.360> him<00:02:14.569> any<00:02:14.690> harder<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:16.760> right

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.559 

you're<00:02:21.829> most<00:02:22.099> bosses

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
you're most bosses

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.739 
you're most bosses
most<00:02:24.560> pulses<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.189> easier<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:25.999> you<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.209> jump

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
most pulses are easier if you just jump

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.229 
most pulses are easier if you just jump
on<00:02:26.870> their<00:02:27.049> heads<00:02:27.230> constantly<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:30.639> with<00:02:31.639> him<00:02:31.909> I

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
on their heads constantly but with him I

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.509 
on their heads constantly but with him I
think<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.870> almost<00:02:33.079> mandatory<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.219> jump

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
think it was almost mandatory you jump

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.220 
think it was almost mandatory you jump
on<00:02:34.670> his<00:02:34.790> head<00:02:34.999> if<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.299> stood<00:02:35.689> there<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.139> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
on his head if I stood there in the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
on his head if I stood there in the
center<00:02:36.469> of<00:02:36.620> their<00:02:36.829> area<00:02:37.459> fighting<00:02:37.939> him<00:02:38.120> I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
center of their area fighting him I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
center of their area fighting him I
probably<00:02:39.349> would<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.620> gotten<00:02:39.799> my<00:02:40.040> butt

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
probably would have gotten my butt

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.270 
probably would have gotten my butt
kicked<00:02:40.519> pretty<00:02:40.879> good<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:42.709> sheer<00:02:42.950> chaos

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
kicked pretty good just sheer chaos

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
every limb that came out started

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.349 
every limb that came out started
shooting<00:02:46.459> crap<00:02:46.730> back<00:02:48.549> well<00:02:49.549> let's<00:02:49.790> give<00:02:50.030> world

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
isn't don't move on the ice jump

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.990 
isn't don't move on the ice jump
everywhere<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.319> whenever<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.310> land<00:03:22.610> make
