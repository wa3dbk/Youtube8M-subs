00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.200
 of the video for more information 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.510
 and now everyone here yale or more and for 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.099
 my personal channel in Spanish and the day of 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.870
 today I bring you just a video 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.720
 quick pretty informal as you can see 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.390
 my bed is not attended and there is a 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.340
 disaster around me so what 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.789
 unique that I come to show you the day of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.860
 today in case you have seen it somewhere and 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.289
 they wonder how it is or just 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.170
 because they like to watch my videos and they are 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.869
 I appreciate a lot because it is this package of 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.129
 halo 4 which is basically the subscription 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:39.460
 gold of 12 months plus one month or 13 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.059
 months and apart includes a pen edition 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.800
 special halo 4 and do that is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.559
 fun indeed when I had 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.069
 announced this was not here in mexico 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.639
 but this one is already importing what 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.589
 which is good then they have a 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.979
 cost a little bit higher apart from 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.040
 the pen for import costs and 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.470
 etc 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.660
 but come on let's see it 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.760
 quickly as you see, I have not 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.240
 open but from what I 've seen it opens 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.960
 too easy right there you pull it and already 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.980
 there it is discovered so it is 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 pretty easy 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.860
 take out the content that can see the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.110
 box there is and here our content 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.110
 as you can see there says product of 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 import blah blah blah this has a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 cost of 800 99 pesos in game rose that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 is where I bought it maybe you can 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.440
 find cheaper if they have if they have 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.920
 lucky or after a few months already 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.090
 spend a little bit the price and here we have 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.470
 because the rest are only two pieces 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 pretty simple but 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 then he found mostly bought 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.330
 for the feather because it really looks 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.730
 interesting and this one is great me the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.470
 I was expecting a little bit smaller but 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.070
 end of accounts it looks good it looks 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.070
 fun 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.080
 and here is the tip as you can see 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.569
 then you can imagine doing your 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.050
 notes there at school with a sword 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.849
 of energy, he finds it a little bit 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.599
 uncomfortable right now that I'm grabbing 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.700
 and pretending that I write something but I 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.450
 guess they get used one 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.010
 a little uncomfortable but this one is pretty 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.280
 see if you can appreciate a little more 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 the details 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.969
 there looks more or less well the sword 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.499
 I hope it does not lack lighting 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.910
 As I tell you, I'm improvising 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:44.250
 quite this video 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.880
 and then the other content that then 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.180
 basically it is the subscription card 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.120
 gold 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.739
 of 12 months plus a month 13 month or 3 what 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.450
 which I needed because I ran out of 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.000
 hold a little and I've been like a week 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.519
 without golf and I need it to bring you more 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.950
 content that I have planned obviously 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.319
 apart from more content they will do 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.719
 many things that I'm about to announce 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.489
 so stay tuned at the ritz 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.329
 Mexico especially on Facebook and in 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.159
 twitter 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.420
 that's where I put many things but 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.370
 recently did some updates 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.280
 both to my personal facebook page 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.840
 like that of Mexico jailbreak 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.459
 there you can directly read all the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.099
 tweets without opening an account 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.159
 on twitter and follow us and so on then 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.859
 just go to facebook and be denle 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.359
 like the geroge page mexico and the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.069
 of highlands and so they are aware 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.689
 of all the news 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.250
 make sure you show them the 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.140
 updates because sometimes they are not 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.140
 sample 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.050
 Well that's basically everything I'm going to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.840
 be announcing more of this in little 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.850
 time and then we continue working in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.550
 here with mexico to be able to do 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.510
 many more and better things soon 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.340
 a surprise in the nest I know it has 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.260
 there was a good time without making a video 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.230
 for the nest I have been working on 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.569
 something like that but 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.030
 and it's taken a lot of time and I do not have 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.950
 as much free time as it would seem 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.709
 but good that has been everything for today 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:20.620
 I hope you like it and you liked it 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.860
 the feather and this is definitely 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.530
 if they buy it, keep in mind that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.320
 now what little I have touched 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.540
 it is already peeling a little bit of 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.850
 there as you can see and I have touched it 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.770
 really very carefully and that's it 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.730
 going out the plastic then it's very 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.160
 sensitive this I would say do not use it 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.180
 just have the out there of 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.529
 collection together with your collection 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.629
 leave it and that's it 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:51.449
 Well, I'm the channel logo of 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:55.639
 youtube from my personal channel 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.639
 See you soon
