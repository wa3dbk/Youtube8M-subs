00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 and known to many half-life games 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.239
 Unfortunately, the character dan has no game 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.949
 beautiful magnificent biography

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.489
 freeman 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 he is 27 years old and he is a PhD in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.699
 theoretical physics since old years 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 interested in learning teleportation 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.210
 studied the whole thing in insbruck scam 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.140
 whenever network these and then settled in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.090
 black mesa 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 and there it began opening the portal for 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 alien invasion army 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.500
 governments and much more it all 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 will see in games half-life and also in her 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 continuation half-life 2 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:34.080
 but we move in small steps to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 fourth place fourth place 4th place 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.050
 of our top takes a series of games brought my 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.210
 edge and its main character dante originally 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.950
 milo makro was not supposed to be this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 should have been a continuation known 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.300
 resident evil series of games but as a result 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.160
 the project was so different from 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.050
 Survival horror and others that his 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.810
 decided to remake a separate project and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.240
 called it to mind the screen just this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 The series has 5 games with this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.860
 four of them are canon made 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.050
 by capcom a 5 was not a jack 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.450
 creatures while the fifth is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.129
 restarting the series in it was redone 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 quite a lot of gameplay 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.590
 features as well as fully go 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 the character of Dante’s canonical history 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.150
 the protagonist of the game is the son of the legendary 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.680
 the dark knight the owner’s spards in again 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.170
 agency yes-mayo edge 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 his main job is the demon hunt 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.519
 despite their demonic roots 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 Dante does not regret anyone 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.810
 he hunts a skilled valiant warrior 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.989
 Excellent in many species 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.480
 cold and firearms in 5 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.000
 Dante's part is a semi-demon disgrace 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.520
 an angel in human form nifilimov 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.500
 still being a child dante for 100 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 the date is important saw them and started killing at that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.500
 while the demons themselves are completely 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.990
 controls the city made of gang 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.690
 terrorists and trying to destroy him 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.960

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:20.270
 that he remembers his past, but we 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:23.610
 move forward to 3rd place top three winners 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.180
 opens the very noir on the game of our top 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.520
 max payne the hero of this game is 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.400
 most depressive and pessimistic 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.990
 representatives of our top head 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.560
 the hero of this game as you could 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.130
 understand 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.410
 name is max by last name n and by the way I don't 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.540
 just said that this is the most noir 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.000
 depressed representative of our top 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.400
 it all starts 3 years ago 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.090
 max works as a cop in hell's 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.990
 kitchen 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.940
 August 22, 1998 after a long 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.250
 working day max is going home 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.810
 when his friend alex boulder offers 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.950
 give him drugs enforcement 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.440
 administration 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.600
 max refuses to get home he 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.480
 walks in and see the mess max 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.010
 understands that someone got into the house 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.000
 suddenly the phone rings 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.820
 max picks up the phone and strange woman 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.709
 asks if she got into the house of payins 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.840
 max asks to call the police on that 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.200
 gets the answer I'm afraid I can not you 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.930
 to help 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.930
 upstairs he finds his wife and daughter 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.590
 killed by psychos max kills addicts 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.200
 but there was already a post as a matter of fact here 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.750
 starts the plot of all subsequent parts 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.360
 but I advise you to play them yourself 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.270
 we move to our second place 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.780
 stamp 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.780
 second place 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.760
 second place today is full of brutality 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.070
 the pathos of the alien bastards 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.120
 because in second place are two 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.870
 character duke nukem and sirius sam 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.750
 let's characters are 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.630
 representatives of two old school jokers 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.430
 sam moan crutoysam 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.500
 it's a war hero with aliens 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.680
 sent to the past to destroy 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.840
 mental well and at the same time save the human 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.780
 kind of now he 's exterminated 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.390
 and who is this duke nukem main character 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.120
 special n us government duke 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.890
 nukem brutal mocking chief 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.450
 a hero who loves to exterminate 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.060
 alien asshole 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.050
 Well, in general, to describe these characters 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.200
 without meaning 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.050
 better to see once than to hear so 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.050
 that we move on to the winner of our top 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:48.470
 first place and so here we get to 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.050
