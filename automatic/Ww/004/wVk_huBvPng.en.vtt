00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
actually a paste however it's not always

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250 
actually a paste however it's not always
the<00:01:05.670> case<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the case that when you actually get to

the case that when you actually get to
the<00:01:07.530> bottom<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.540> jar<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> actually

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the bottom of the jar that you actually

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.670 
the bottom of the jar that you actually
get<00:01:10.799> such<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> consistent<00:01:11.729> mixture<00:01:12.560> when<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
get such a consistent mixture when you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.490 
get such a consistent mixture when you
get<00:01:13.830> sometimes<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.240> stage<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
get sometimes you get to stage that is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
get sometimes you get to stage that is
actually<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> pace<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.820> instead<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
actually a pace like this so instead of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
actually a pace like this so instead of
using<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> huge<00:01:21.570> amount<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.770> try<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
using a huge amount to actually try and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
using a huge amount to actually try and
marinate<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> meat<00:01:25.729> when<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> gets<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
marinate the meat when it gets to this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.760 
marinate the meat when it gets to this
stage<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:30.110> some<00:01:31.110> paste<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
stage is that I put some paste into the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
stage is that I put some paste into the
box<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.240> cooking<00:01:33.570> oil<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> can

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
box and use some cooking oil now it can

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.370 
box and use some cooking oil now it can
be<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:35.340> old<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.329> cooking<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
be any old that you use for cooking to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
be any old that you use for cooking to
fling<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.439> moyel

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
fling it out to make it into a moyel

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
fling it out to make it into a moyel
liquid<00:01:42.229> paste<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> can

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
liquid paste like this so that you can

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
liquid paste like this so that you can
actually<00:01:45.600> use<00:01:45.869> lesser<00:01:46.470> man<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.610> less<00:01:47.880> spicy

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
actually use lesser man and less spicy

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.580 
actually use lesser man and less spicy
as<00:01:48.570> well<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.259> coat<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.130> meat<00:01:50.159> itself

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.520 

now<00:01:54.310> there's<00:01:55.210> nothing<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.079> market<00:01:56.289> that

actually sells the peanut sauce that
goes<00:02:01.719> with<00:02:02.200> me<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.189> cannot<00:02:03.640> really<00:02:03.939> have

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
goes with me but you cannot really have

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.800 
goes with me but you cannot really have
a<00:02:04.299> satay<00:02:05.020> without<00:02:05.560> peanut<00:02:05.979> sauce<00:02:06.189> all<00:02:07.030> those

a satay without peanut sauce all those

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.479 
a satay without peanut sauce all those
great<00:02:08.229> tastes<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.709> you've<00:02:08.920> got<00:02:09.099> in<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
great tastes that you've got in the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.479 
great tastes that you've got in the
restaurants<00:02:10.420> um<00:02:10.650> they<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:12.040> make<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> up

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
restaurants um they actually make it up

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.460 
restaurants um they actually make it up
themselves<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.360> relatively<00:02:14.019> easy<00:02:14.110> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
themselves but it's relatively easy to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.589 
themselves but it's relatively easy to
make<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.250> doesn't<00:02:15.610> take<00:02:15.760> five<00:02:15.970> minutes<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.360> do

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
make it doesn't take five minutes to do

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.650 
make it doesn't take five minutes to do
so<00:02:17.099> all<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.160> need<00:02:18.549> for<00:02:18.819> making<00:02:19.150> peanut<00:02:19.360> sauce
