00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
up mail it back to us we then digitize

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.540 
up mail it back to us we then digitize
it<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> CAD<00:00:45.989> drawing<00:00:46.379> email<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> CAD

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it make a CAD drawing email on the CAD

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.100 
it make a CAD drawing email on the CAD
draw<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.059> verify<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:48.840> the

different<00:03:27.580> pieces<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.299> foam<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.959> are

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
different pieces of foam that are

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.199 
different pieces of foam that are
somehow<00:03:29.380> laminated<00:03:30.130> together<00:03:30.220> what<00:03:31.000> do<00:03:31.150> you

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
somehow laminated together what do you

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.020 
somehow laminated together what do you
do<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.900> foam<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.489> stick<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.880> one

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
do to the foam to get it to stick to one

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.830 
do to the foam to get it to stick to one
another<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:35.970> contact<00:03:36.970> cement<00:03:37.209> them<00:03:37.600> with<00:03:37.810> a

another we contact cement them with a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.310 
another we contact cement them with a
high-strength<00:03:38.590> contacted<00:03:39.459> adhesives<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
high-strength contacted adhesives so you

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.080 
high-strength contacted adhesives so you
have<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.680> put<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.450> both<00:03:43.450> pieces<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:44.079> foam

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
have to put this on both pieces of foam

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.479 
have to put this on both pieces of foam
roll<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.269> out<00:03:46.390> roll<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.799> like<00:03:48.040> traditional

you<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.920> digitize<00:06:06.430> it<00:06:06.670> here<00:06:06.910> and<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.420> you<00:06:07.630> do

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
you you digitize it here and and you do

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.210 
you you digitize it here and and you do
the<00:06:07.900> cutting<00:06:08.020> process<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.560> stage<00:06:08.890> it's

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
the cutting process that stage it's

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.100 
the cutting process that stage it's
basically<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.820> same<00:06:09.940> operate

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
basically the same operate

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.080 
basically the same operate
what<00:06:11.440> we're<00:06:11.680> doing<00:06:11.890> with<00:06:12.040> your<00:06:12.070> vote<00:06:12.430> so<00:06:13.030> you

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
what we're doing with your vote so you

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.510 
what we're doing with your vote so you
import<00:06:13.720> you<00:06:14.320> import<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:14.980> digitize

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
import you import to digitize

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.430 
import you import to digitize
information<00:06:16.450> into<00:06:16.690> your<00:06:16.720> computer<00:06:17.290> and

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
information into your computer and

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.010 
information into your computer and
that's<00:06:17.830> what<00:06:18.100> gets<00:06:18.310> it<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.790> talk<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.450> the

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
that's what gets it to talk to the

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.710 
that's what gets it to talk to the
cutting<00:06:20.320> apparatus<00:06:20.890> right<00:06:21.700> could<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:22.300> show

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
cutting apparatus right could you show

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.140 
cutting apparatus right could you show
me<00:06:22.750> some<00:06:23.200> C<00:06:23.350> deck<00:06:23.530> getting<00:06:23.860> cut<00:06:24.040> shirt<00:06:24.490> lead

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
me some C deck getting cut shirt lead

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.300 
me some C deck getting cut shirt lead
the<00:06:25.180> way
