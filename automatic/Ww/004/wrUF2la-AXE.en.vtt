other stuff like that here I changed it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.200 
other stuff like that here I changed it
to<00:01:39.420> photo<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.659> take<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:44.180> snap<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
guess I would use it to like record or

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.209 
guess I would use it to like record or
something<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:57.020> wouldn't<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> just

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
something I wouldn't use it to like just

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.789 
something I wouldn't use it to like just
go<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> make<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> movie<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> would<00:02:01.590> use<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
go out and make a movie I would use a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
go out and make a movie I would use a
different<00:02:01.890> camera<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.320> but<00:02:05.030> once<00:02:06.030> again
