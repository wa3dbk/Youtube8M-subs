00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.139
 Hello my name is Alexey Trifonov 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.589
 This issue will discuss how 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.870
 make maximum diversity in your game 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.430
 using a minimum of funds for 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.900
 the basis we take here is a drawing 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.900
 barrels and snare drum 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:48.019
 play on top of this drawing party 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:01:02.269
 cowbell quarters replace cowbell 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:01:06.170
 play eighth notes on hi-hat 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.700
 a plate of roofs on the second or fourth 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.700
 share along with snare 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:36.929
 insert snare drum 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:51.569
 between hi-hat beats, open hi-hat 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:53.610
 on the last eighth so then now 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:02:08.310
 hi-hat will open for the last 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:10.890
 the sixteenth so mark the last 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.400
 the eighth so strikes the rooftops and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.400
 snare drum 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:40.560
 let's move one sixteenth installment 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:42.930
 barrels and now play the eighth note by 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.689
 ride ride noting every quarter 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.689
 hit it down it will look like this 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.010
 and now we mix it all together and 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.010
 let's see what happens 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.590
 there is
