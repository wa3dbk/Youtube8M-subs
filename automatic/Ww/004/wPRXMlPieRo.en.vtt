00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and future you know giving you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950 
and future you know giving you
information<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:57.010> answer<00:00:57.460> questions<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.870> do

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
information to answer questions to do

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.950

different<00:00:59.260> readings<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.769> stuff<00:01:00.010> but<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
different readings and stuff but the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.060 
different readings and stuff but the
number<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.870> each<00:01:04.870> Oracle<00:01:05.560> deck<00:01:05.710> has

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
number is different each Oracle deck has

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.310 
number is different each Oracle deck has
a<00:01:06.400> different<00:01:06.850> number<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:08.200> cards<00:01:08.710> but<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:11.200> it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
a different number of cards but when it

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.620 
a different number of cards but when it
comes<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.680> tarot<00:01:11.950> cards<00:01:12.310> themselves<00:01:12.430> they<00:01:13.420> all

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
comes to tarot cards themselves they all

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.780 
comes to tarot cards themselves they all
have<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.960> same<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.890> know<00:01:15.010> number<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.400> cards

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
have the same you know number of cards

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.850 
have the same you know number of cards
but<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.630> only<00:01:16.780> difference<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.470> artwork

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
but the only difference is the artwork

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.030 
but the only difference is the artwork
so<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:19.840> comes<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.170> Oracle<00:01:20.560> cards<00:01:20.860> you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
so when it comes to Oracle cards you

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
so when it comes to Oracle cards you
could<00:01:21.190> have<00:01:22.469> similarities<00:01:23.469> in<00:01:23.920> artwork<00:01:24.310> but

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
could have similarities in artwork but

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.260 
could have similarities in artwork but
like<00:01:26.229> one<00:01:26.500> card<00:01:26.829> will<00:01:27.070> look<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.729> know<00:01:27.850> one<00:01:28.090> way

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
like one card will look you know one way

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.940 
like one card will look you know one way
and<00:01:28.570> then<00:01:28.659> another<00:01:28.689> car<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.350> be<00:01:29.469> completely

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
and then another car can be completely

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.230 
and then another car can be completely
different<00:01:30.430> looking<00:01:30.700> like<00:01:30.850> they<00:01:31.000> came<00:01:31.180> from

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
different looking like they came from

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.940 
different looking like they came from
two<00:01:31.600> completely<00:01:31.810> different<00:01:32.170> decks<00:01:32.619> for<00:01:32.860> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
two completely different decks for the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.370 
two completely different decks for the
same<00:01:33.130> artist<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.479> that's<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.079> difference

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
same artist so that's the difference

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.959 
same artist so that's the difference
between<00:01:35.439> Oracle<00:01:36.039> cards<00:01:36.399> but<00:01:36.520> we'll<00:01:36.729> talk<00:01:36.909> more

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
between Oracle cards but we'll talk more

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.230 
between Oracle cards but we'll talk more
about<00:01:37.240> oracle<00:01:37.840> cards<00:01:38.259> another<00:01:38.530> time

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.750 

so<00:01:43.810> you're<00:01:43.960> probably<00:01:44.049> wondering<00:01:44.369> how<00:01:45.369> do<00:01:45.430> you
