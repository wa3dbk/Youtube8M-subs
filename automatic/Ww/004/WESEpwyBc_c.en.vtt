hey folks satchel here all things
dentistry<00:00:02.340> calm<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.540> just<00:00:03.720> wanted<00:00:03.899> to

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
dentistry calm and I just wanted to

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.320 
dentistry calm and I just wanted to
explain<00:00:05.899> dental<00:00:06.899> composites

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
explain dental composites

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.680 
explain dental composites
they<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.769> there's<00:00:10.769> often<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.420> crazy<00:00:12.420> at

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
they are the there's often a crazy at

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.999 
they are the there's often a crazy at
every<00:00:12.960> PowerPoint<00:00:13.469> I've<00:00:13.590> looked<00:00:13.830> at

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
every PowerPoint I've looked at

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
every PowerPoint I've looked at
especially<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> resin<00:00:15.269> city<00:00:15.509> there<00:00:15.780> are

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
especially the resin city there are

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.340 
especially the resin city there are
about<00:00:16.250> 300<00:00:17.720> slides<00:00:18.720> along<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.260> they're

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
about 300 slides along and they're

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.029 
about 300 slides along and they're
painful<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.480> basics<00:00:21.990> there's<00:00:22.680> three

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
painful so the basics there's three

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.570 
painful so the basics there's three
major<00:00:23.519> components<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:25.279> composite<00:00:26.279> resin

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
major components of composite resin

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.509 
major components of composite resin
you've<00:00:26.849> got<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.599> filler<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.070> these

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you've got the filler which is these

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.080 
you've got the filler which is these
little<00:00:29.640> rocks<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.929> courts<00:00:31.759> sometimes<00:00:32.759> use

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
little rocks so courts sometimes use

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
little rocks so courts sometimes use
your<00:00:33.270> cone<00:00:33.480> iam<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.770> feel<00:00:34.980> texif<00:00:35.340> cream

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
your cone iam I like feel texif cream

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.709 
your cone iam I like feel texif cream
then<00:00:36.420> you've<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.079> silent<00:00:37.980> ater<00:00:38.510> which<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
then you've got a silent ater which in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
then you've got a silent ater which in
this<00:00:39.809> case<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> fluorescent<00:00:40.760> paint<00:00:41.760> it's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this case is fluorescent paint it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
this case is fluorescent paint it's
that's<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.590> then

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that's all I can think of and then

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's all I can think of and then
you've<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:45.030> resin<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:47.160> stick

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you've got your resin so here is a stick

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.500 
you've got your resin so here is a stick
and<00:00:47.820> seal<00:00:48.170> waterproof<00:00:49.170> adhesive<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.510> really

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and seal waterproof adhesive so really

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
and seal waterproof adhesive so really
simply<00:00:52.039> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> had<00:00:53.460> only<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.120> they've<00:00:54.239> done

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
simply if you had only and they've done

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
simply if you had only and they've done
this<00:00:54.539> before<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> only<00:00:55.230> had<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.949> resin<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
this before if you only had the resin it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
this before if you only had the resin it
just<00:00:56.760> wears<00:00:56.940> away<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> do

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
just wears away so what you want to do

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
just wears away so what you want to do
is<00:00:59.160> give<00:00:59.370> put<00:00:59.760> some<00:00:59.940> rocks<00:01:00.149> into<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.140> like

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
is give put some rocks into it just like

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.429 
is give put some rocks into it just like
concrete<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> give<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:03.000> strength

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
concrete just to give it more strength

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.750 
concrete just to give it more strength
but<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> also<00:01:04.710> want<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.309> able<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> claw

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
but you also want to be able to claw

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.080 
but you also want to be able to claw
onto<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> cylon

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
onto it so what they do is a cylon

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.200 
onto it so what they do is a cylon
aiding<00:01:09.360> agent<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.740> mean<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.700> they're<00:01:11.850> orange

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
aiding agent is I mean if they're orange

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
aiding agent is I mean if they're orange
they<00:01:12.330> look<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> goofy<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.310> Saturn<00:01:14.310> ate

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they look kind of goofy but Saturn ate

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
they look kind of goofy but Saturn ate
the<00:01:14.610> rocks<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> glue<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.680> going

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the rocks because the glue is not going

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070 
the rocks because the glue is not going
to<00:01:16.979> stick<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> rocks<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.570> after<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to stick to the rocks but after you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.880 
to stick to the rocks but after you
silent<00:01:19.650> ate<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.729> opens<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.960> that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
silent ate it it opens up and that's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
silent ate it it opens up and that's
some<00:01:25.729> chemical<00:01:26.729> structure<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.140> will

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
some chemical structure is so so it will

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
some chemical structure is so so it will
open<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.240> resin<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:31.380> bond<00:01:32.659> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
open up and then the resin will bond to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300 
open up and then the resin will bond to
the<00:01:33.780> silent<00:01:34.200> era<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:34.770> bonds<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the silent era which then bonds to the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.420 
the silent era which then bonds to the
rocks<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.200> then

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.550 

the<00:01:40.970> Eagles<00:01:41.300> your<00:01:41.450> residence<00:01:41.900> I'm<00:01:42.380> just

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
the Eagles your residence I'm just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.180 
the Eagles your residence I'm just
putting<00:01:42.800> glue<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.190> here<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.840> show<00:01:45.190> just

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
putting glue in here just to show just

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.430 
putting glue in here just to show just
to<00:01:46.400> explain<00:01:46.730> this<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.870> essentially<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
to explain this so this essentially is

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.740 
to explain this so this essentially is
your<00:01:48.650> dental<00:01:49.070> composite<00:01:49.870> and<00:01:50.870> of<00:01:50.990> course<00:01:52.750> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
your dental composite and of course this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.020 
your dental composite and of course this
is<00:01:53.930> going<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.620> Auto<00:01:54.800> cure<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
is going to this is Auto cure in the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.720 
is going to this is Auto cure in the
sense<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.360> ilk<00:01:56.690> here<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.050> its<00:01:57.230> own<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.520> ones

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
sense that ilk here on its own the ones

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.220 
sense that ilk here on its own the ones
we<00:01:58.940> typically<00:01:59.330> use<00:01:59.450> unless<00:01:59.840> you're<00:01:59.990> doing<00:02:00.080> a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
we typically use unless you're doing a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.620 
we typically use unless you're doing a
core<00:02:00.470> build-up<00:02:00.830> will<00:02:01.040> be<00:02:01.220> model<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.330> will<00:02:02.480> be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
core build-up will be model you will be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.700 
core build-up will be model you will be
light<00:02:02.840> cured<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:05.330> again<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.260> fluorescent

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
light cured and so again the fluorescent

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.000 
light cured and so again the fluorescent
orange<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.100> silent<00:02:07.520> editor<00:02:07.760> so<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
orange is a silent editor so the so the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.710 
orange is a silent editor so the so the
organic<00:02:10.300> matrix<00:02:12.520> or<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.700> resin<00:02:14.060> will<00:02:14.210> bond<00:02:14.480> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
organic matrix or the resin will bond to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.550 
organic matrix or the resin will bond to
the<00:02:14.840> rocks<00:02:15.160> which<00:02:16.160> are<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.460> filler<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.870> that's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the rocks which are the filler so that's

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.170 
the rocks which are the filler so that's
about<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.060> different

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
about it and then you have all different

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.910 
about it and then you have all different
types<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:20.900> essentially<00:02:21.770> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
types with that's essentially the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.860 
types with that's essentially the
easiest<00:02:22.310> way<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.580> describe<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.270> hope<00:02:23.720> that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
easiest way to describe it hope that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.560 
easiest way to describe it hope that
helps<00:02:24.230> Cheers
