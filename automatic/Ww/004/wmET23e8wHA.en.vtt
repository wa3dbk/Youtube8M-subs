you

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.670 

with<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.920> America's<00:00:37.490> Cup<00:00:37.520> in<00:00:38.260> 2001<00:00:39.260> with

2007 with the Saffir espanol in Valencia

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.720 
2007 with the Saffir espanol in Valencia
so<00:00:45.590> there<00:00:45.860> was<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.220> pinnacle<00:00:46.400> of<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:47.239> career

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.319 

obviously<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.230> professional<00:00:55.230> sailors<00:00:55.620> we

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
obviously as professional sailors we

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
obviously as professional sailors we
rely<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.720> what<00:00:58.470> we<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.010> our<00:00:59.100> eyes

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
rely a lot on what we see with our eyes

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.460 
rely a lot on what we see with our eyes
we<00:01:00.000> spend<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.330> lot<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.750> looking<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.290> over

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
we spend a lot of time looking out over

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.950 
we spend a lot of time looking out over
the<00:01:01.710> water<00:01:01.860> looking<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:02.940> into<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> sails<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the water looking up into the sails a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
the water looking up into the sails a
lot<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.739> filled<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
lot of you are filled with how to make a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.790 
lot of you are filled with how to make a
boat<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.390> fast<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.410> go<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
boat go fast and where to go and the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.590 
boat go fast and where to go and the
racetrack<00:01:08.190> comes<00:01:08.490> from<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.420> with

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
racetrack comes from what you see with

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.160 
racetrack comes from what you see with
your<00:01:09.630> eyes

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
your eyes

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.830 
your eyes
I<00:01:12.979> think<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> polarization<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.240> lenses

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I think the polarization of the lenses

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.290 
I think the polarization of the lenses
is<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.950> very<00:01:17.190> critical<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.000> look

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
is is very very critical when you look

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.930 
is is very very critical when you look
on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> water<00:01:19.259> looking<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.860> wind<00:01:20.040> because

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
on the water looking for wind because

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.060 
on the water looking for wind because
you<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.300> without<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> polarization<00:01:22.680> load

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you don't without the polarization load

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
you don't without the polarization load
you<00:01:23.399> don't<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> texture<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> water

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you don't get the texture of the water

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
you don't get the texture of the water
but<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.039> with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.910> good

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but with with a with a really good

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.469 
but with with a with a really good
technical<00:01:27.950> polarized<00:01:28.950> lens<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
technical polarized lens you can see the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.760 
technical polarized lens you can see the
difference<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
difference and you can see the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.190 
difference and you can see the
difference<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.250> looking<00:01:32.550> for

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.420 

especially<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.320> these<00:01:37.710> boats<00:01:37.980> where<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
especially on these boats where you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
especially on these boats where you
where<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.120> very<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.450> fast

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
where you go very very fast

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
where you go very very fast
you<00:01:40.830> gotta<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> lot<00:01:41.580> of<00:01:41.700> spray<00:01:41.940> in<00:01:42.570> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you gotta get a lot of spray in your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.030 
you gotta get a lot of spray in your
face<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.650> it's<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.070> important<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.360> get

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
face and it's quite important not to get

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
face and it's quite important not to get
obstructed<00:01:47.040> by<00:01:47.220> getting<00:01:47.550> spray<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.910> your<00:01:47.940> face

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
obstructed by getting spray in your face

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
obstructed by getting spray in your face
and<00:01:48.570> therefore<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.800> quite<00:01:50.220> important<00:01:50.700> for

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and therefore it's quite important for

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.750 
and therefore it's quite important for
us<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.150> have<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.330> class<00:01:52.260> on<00:01:52.590> which<00:01:52.830> we<00:01:53.580> can

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
us to have a class on which we can

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.310 
us to have a class on which we can
obviously<00:01:54.180> check<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> spray<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.110> water

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
obviously check the spray and the water

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.190 
obviously check the spray and the water
comes<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:56.040> nice<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.610> easy<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.090> clean<00:01:57.390> very

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
comes off nice and easy and clean very

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.870 
comes off nice and easy and clean very
quick<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:01.410> impact<00:02:01.800> X<00:02:01.979> lens<00:02:02.280> allows<00:02:03.240> us<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.810> see

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
quick the impact X lens allows us to see

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.400 
quick the impact X lens allows us to see
obviously<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.479> coefficient<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.200> water

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
obviously the coefficient on the water

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.280 
obviously the coefficient on the water
but<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> also<00:02:08.610> allows<00:02:08.940> us<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.479> instruments

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
but it also allows us to see instruments

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.030 
but it also allows us to see instruments
at<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> whole<00:02:10.800> time

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.280 

our<00:02:16.040> safety<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.550> obviously<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.360> very<00:02:17.780> important

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
our safety is obviously a very important

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.260 
our safety is obviously a very important
thing<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.560> these<00:02:18.680> boats<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.580> travel<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.060> very

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
thing on these boats we travel at very

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.050 
thing on these boats we travel at very
very<00:02:20.360> high<00:02:20.600> speeds<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.350> at<00:02:21.890> times<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.460> get<00:02:22.850> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
very high speeds so at times you get a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.240 
very high speeds so at times you get a
good<00:02:23.330> knock<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.750> your<00:02:23.780> head<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.920> what<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
good knock on your head and and what the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.760 
good knock on your head and and what the
impact<00:02:25.610> ends<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.450> does<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.410> actually

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
impact ends then it does is it actually

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.970 
impact ends then it does is it actually
allows<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.420> get<00:02:30.050> hit<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.290> get<00:02:30.770> knocked

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
allows you to to get hit and get knocked

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.440 
allows you to to get hit and get knocked
on<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> head<00:02:31.340> or<00:02:31.640> without<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.090> lenses

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
on the head or without the lenses

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.360 
on the head or without the lenses
breaking<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.830> don't<00:02:33.950> want<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> have

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
breaking you don't want to have

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.550 
breaking you don't want to have
shattered<00:02:34.610> glass<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.209> your<00:02:35.360> eyes<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.810> that's

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
shattered glass in your eyes so that's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770 
shattered glass in your eyes so that's
why<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.770> impact<00:02:37.190> X<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> good<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
why the impact X is a good thing for the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:49.380 
why the impact X is a good thing for the
safety<00:02:38.990> as<00:02:39.200> well
