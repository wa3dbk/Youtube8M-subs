project<00:00:07.529> I've<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> look<00:00:09.090> at<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> location

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
project I've have a look at the location

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400 
project I've have a look at the location
and<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.610> looks<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.389> said<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> really

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and it looks as you said like a really

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.920 
and it looks as you said like a really
odd<00:00:14.219> dry<00:00:14.820> dusty<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.960> clearly<00:00:16.410> environment<00:00:17.930> as

odd dry dusty and clearly environment as

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.349 
odd dry dusty and clearly environment as
we<00:00:19.140> discussed<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.010> face<00:00:20.250> mask<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> best

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we discussed the face mask is the best

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.500 
we discussed the face mask is the best
way<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.310> getting<00:00:23.310> relief<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.000> working

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
way of getting relief from that working

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
way of getting relief from that working
environment<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.250> thing<00:00:26.550> though<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
environment the one thing though that is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
environment the one thing though that is
different<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.170> fishing

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
different to how the fishing

different to how the fishing
professionals<00:00:29.340> wear<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> buff<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> water

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
professionals wear the buff on the water

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.080

is<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.590> most<00:00:31.859> probably<00:00:32.189> won't<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.669> too

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
is that you most probably won't have too

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.799 
is that you most probably won't have too
much<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.020> queen<00:00:34.380> wind<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> most<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
much of a queen wind and most of the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
much of a queen wind and most of the
time<00:00:36.989> especially<00:00:37.230> after<00:00:37.559> lunch<00:00:37.890> breaks<00:00:38.219> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
time especially after lunch breaks are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
time especially after lunch breaks are
say<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.360> hot<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:39.989> get

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
say it would be really hot when they get

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.040 
say it would be really hot when they get
when<00:00:40.730> people<00:00:41.730> trying<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> mount<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.750> out

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
when people trying to mount or get out

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
when people trying to mount or get out
in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> heating<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> number<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:45.870> rule

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
in the heating in so the number one rule

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
in the heating in so the number one rule
I<00:00:46.320> would<00:00:46.620> say<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.100> testing<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.610> buffing<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I would say for testing or buffing the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
I would say for testing or buffing the
heat<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.930> make<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> wet<00:00:49.410> first

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
heat is to make it wet first

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.630 
heat is to make it wet first
so<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.940> tape<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.899> buff<00:00:52.309> under<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> water

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so just tape it the buff under the water

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
so just tape it the buff under the water
until<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.809> fully<00:00:55.079> wet<00:00:55.789> rinse<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.140> just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
until it's fully wet rinse it out just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.819 
until it's fully wet rinse it out just
give<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> real<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.510> crunch<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> now

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
give it like a real good crunch and now

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.630 
give it like a real good crunch and now
comes<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> important<00:01:02.489> part<00:01:03.140> shake<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
comes the important part shake it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
comes the important part shake it
shaking<00:01:05.640> makes<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> fabric<00:01:06.479> breathable

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
shaking makes the fabric breathable

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
shaking makes the fabric breathable
again<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.820> also<00:01:08.869> activates<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
again and also activates a bit of the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
again and also activates a bit of the
cooling<00:01:10.619> effect<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.340> shaking<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
cooling effect as you're shaking it you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
cooling effect as you're shaking it you
should<00:01:12.750> feel<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> buff<00:01:14.070> fabric

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
should feel that the buff fabric

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
should feel that the buff fabric
actually<00:01:14.790> gets<00:01:15.150> cool<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.770> comes<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
actually gets cool and then comes to the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually gets cool and then comes to the
next<00:01:17.430> step<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:20.119> put<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> over<00:01:21.360> your

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
next step you take it put it over your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.179 
next step you take it put it over your
head<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:23.180> put<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> face<00:01:24.930> mask<00:01:28.009> by<00:01:29.009> now

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
head and put it up as a face mask by now

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
head and put it up as a face mask by now
you<00:01:29.250> should<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.210> cooling

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you should have a bit of a cooling

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
you should have a bit of a cooling
effect<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> really

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
effect the one thing that is really

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.289 
effect the one thing that is really
important<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> trial<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.090> make

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
important for the trial is that you make

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.170 
important for the trial is that you make
sure<00:01:36.600> everybody<00:01:37.350> has<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.460> gap<00:01:38.729> between<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
sure everybody has that gap between the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
sure everybody has that gap between the
notes<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> face<00:01:39.869> closed<00:01:40.520> because

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
notes and the face closed because

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.069 
notes and the face closed because
bringing<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> nose<00:01:42.570> will<00:01:42.899> just

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
bringing out through the nose will just

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.560 
bringing out through the nose will just
warm<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> face<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> warm<00:01:45.149> exhaust

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
warm up the face or the warm exhaust

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
warm up the face or the warm exhaust
from<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> body<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.320> goes<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> face

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
from the body just goes over the face

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
from the body just goes over the face
the<00:01:47.970> easiest<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.720> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the easiest way to do that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
the easiest way to do that
take<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.280> fingers<00:01:51.240> against<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> nose

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
take it down fingers against the nose

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
take it down fingers against the nose
against<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> nostrils<00:01:53.689> even<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.909> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
against the nostrils even like that you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
against the nostrils even like that you
don't<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.509> afraid<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> anything<00:01:58.200> but

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
don't have to be afraid of anything but

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.940 
don't have to be afraid of anything but
buffers<00:01:58.890> anti<00:01:59.600> septic<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.960> kills<00:02:01.229> germs<00:02:01.619> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
buffers anti septic it kills germs of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.630 
buffers anti septic it kills germs of
everything<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> lifetime

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
everything for a lifetime

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.760 
everything for a lifetime
that's<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:04.000> can<00:02:04.210> easily<00:02:04.510> do<00:02:04.690> that<00:02:04.770> now

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
that's they can easily do that now

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.830 
that's they can easily do that now
you've<00:02:05.979> got<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.190> here<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.790> gap<00:02:06.970> is<00:02:07.120> closed<00:02:07.450> I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you've got it here the gap is closed I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.040 
you've got it here the gap is closed I
still<00:02:08.819> advise<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.179> breathe<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.600> through<00:02:10.840> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
still advise to breathe out through the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.680 
still advise to breathe out through the
note<00:02:11.230> through<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> mouth<00:02:11.850> it's<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.180> best

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
note through the mouth it's the best

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.540 
note through the mouth it's the best
calling<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> face<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> breathe<00:02:15.370> that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
calling for the face is to breathe that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.320 
calling for the face is to breathe that
through<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> nose

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
through the nose

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.420 
through the nose
but<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.170> would<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.650> gap<00:02:17.830> close<00:02:18.130> that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
but like that would that gap close that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.020 
but like that would that gap close that
does<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> lot<00:02:18.850> other<00:02:19.510> thing<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.580> pull<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.760> gap

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
does a lot other thing is pull this gap

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.949 
does a lot other thing is pull this gap
up<00:02:22.300> yeah<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.770> then<00:02:25.770> put<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.920> sunnies<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.959> this
