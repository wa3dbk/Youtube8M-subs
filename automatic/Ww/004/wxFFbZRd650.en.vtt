00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
now let's talk about this base guys so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.539 
now let's talk about this base guys so
anyway<00:02:48.500> what's<00:02:49.500> happening<00:02:49.890> with<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.130> basis

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
anyway what's happening with this basis

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.220 
anyway what's happening with this basis
I<00:02:50.640> went<00:02:50.880> ahead<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> did<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> new<00:02:51.599> Frankenstein

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
I went ahead and did a new Frankenstein

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.660 
I went ahead and did a new Frankenstein
design<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.680> i<00:02:52.799> call<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:53.519> original

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
design as i call it was my original

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
design as i call it was my original
design<00:02:54.480> i'm<00:02:54.989> sure<00:02:55.170> other<00:02:55.349> people<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.590> done

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
design i'm sure other people have done

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.430 
design i'm sure other people have done
this<00:02:55.860> design<00:02:56.190> before<00:02:56.370> there's<00:02:56.989> actually<00:02:57.989> not

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
this design before there's actually not

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.530 
this design before there's actually not
that<00:02:58.500> many<00:02:58.860> designs<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.579> can<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.880> effectively

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
that many designs you can do effectively

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.020 
that many designs you can do effectively
for<00:03:00.930> farming<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.549> think<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
for farming I don't think this one is
