you

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.380 

because<00:00:04.009> I<00:00:04.100> believe<00:00:04.370> every<00:00:04.730> team<00:00:04.880> across<00:00:05.120> the

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
because I believe every team across the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.389 
because I believe every team across the
net<00:00:05.540> has<00:00:05.750> a<00:00:05.779> weakness<00:00:06.170> somewhere<00:00:06.319> and<00:00:06.920> if

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
net has a weakness somewhere and if

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.640 
net has a weakness somewhere and if
you're<00:00:07.520> able<00:00:07.700> to<00:00:08.000> expose<00:00:08.389> that<00:00:08.450> weakness<00:00:08.930> with

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
you're able to expose that weakness with

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.040 
you're able to expose that weakness with
your<00:00:09.860> serve<00:00:10.210> whether<00:00:11.210> it<00:00:11.360> be<00:00:11.480> a<00:00:11.509> pour<00:00:11.809> passer

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
your serve whether it be a pour passer

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.320 
your serve whether it be a pour passer
or<00:00:12.469> whether<00:00:12.710> it<00:00:12.830> be<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.250> inability<00:00:13.610> for<00:00:13.849> a

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
or whether it be the inability for a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.019 
or whether it be the inability for a
setter<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.839> run<00:00:14.990> an<00:00:15.080> offense<00:00:15.820> setting<00:00:16.820> over

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
setter to run an offense setting over

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.779 
setter to run an offense setting over
her<00:00:17.150> left<00:00:17.360> shoulder<00:00:18.400> difficult<00:00:19.400> things<00:00:19.609> like

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
her left shoulder difficult things like

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.970 
her left shoulder difficult things like
that<00:00:19.939> where<00:00:20.150> you<00:00:20.240> can<00:00:20.390> slow<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:20.779> team<00:00:21.109> down<00:00:21.350> take

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
that where you can slow a team down take

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.160 
that where you can slow a team down take
their<00:00:22.160> middle<00:00:22.460> out<00:00:22.990> anything<00:00:23.990> like<00:00:24.140> that

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
their middle out anything like that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.170 
their middle out anything like that
where<00:00:24.590> they<00:00:24.769> become<00:00:25.070> more<00:00:25.369> predictable<00:00:25.939> I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
where they become more predictable I

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.000 
where they become more predictable I
think<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:26.930> create<00:00:27.260> an<00:00:27.349> advantage<00:00:27.710> on<00:00:27.859> your

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
think you create an advantage on your

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.120 
think you create an advantage on your
side<00:00:28.630> also<00:00:29.630> after<00:00:29.840> this<00:00:30.109> to<00:00:30.679> following<00:00:30.980> this

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
side also after this to following this

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.350 
side also after this to following this
conversation<00:00:31.460> i'll<00:00:31.880> be<00:00:31.970> talking<00:00:32.119> about

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
conversation i'll be talking about

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.229 
conversation i'll be talking about
transition<00:00:33.080> and<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:34.129> think<00:00:34.370> transition<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.059> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
transition and I think transition is the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.660 
transition and I think transition is the
ultimate<00:00:35.390> connection<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:36.290> your<00:00:36.440> serve<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.040> so

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
ultimate connection to your serve and so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.460 
ultimate connection to your serve and so
obviously<00:00:38.210> i'll<00:00:38.330> get<00:00:38.479> to<00:00:38.629> that<00:00:38.659> if<00:00:39.049> you<00:00:39.229> choose

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
obviously i'll get to that if you choose

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.719 
obviously i'll get to that if you choose
to<00:00:39.650> go<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:39.830> that<00:00:39.979> after<00:00:40.220> this<00:00:40.479> so<00:00:42.729> obvious

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
to go to that after this so obvious

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.820 
to go to that after this so obvious
thing<00:00:43.940> about<00:00:44.120> serving<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.870> easiest<00:00:45.379> point<00:00:45.620> is

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
thing about serving the easiest point is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.890 
thing about serving the easiest point is
to<00:00:46.070> get<00:00:46.190> an<00:00:46.309> ace<00:00:46.519> doesn't<00:00:47.269> happen<00:00:47.390> very<00:00:47.540> often

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
to get an ace doesn't happen very often

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.660 
to get an ace doesn't happen very often
but<00:00:48.049> obviously<00:00:48.500> when<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:48.739> get<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:49.549> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
but obviously when we get that it's a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.140 
but obviously when we get that it's a
great<00:00:49.879> thing<00:00:50.530> we<00:00:51.530> also<00:00:51.680> try<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.010> serve<00:00:52.339> we<00:00:52.970> use

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
great thing we also try to serve we use

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.810 
great thing we also try to serve we use
a<00:00:53.180> three-point<00:00:53.839> passing<00:00:54.350> scale<00:00:54.619> and<00:00:54.890> for

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
a three-point passing scale and for

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.009 
a three-point passing scale and for
those<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.150> who<00:00:56.239> don't<00:00:56.420> know<00:00:56.600> what<00:00:56.839> that<00:00:56.989> is

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
those of you who don't know what that is

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.530 
those of you who don't know what that is
a<00:00:57.409> three<00:00:58.100> option<00:00:58.489> pass<00:00:58.699> allows<00:00:59.089> you<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.330> set

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
a three option pass allows you to set

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.630 
a three option pass allows you to set
all<00:00:59.720> three<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> your<00:01:00.170> hitters<00:01:00.440> okay<00:01:01.220> so<00:01:01.280> as<00:01:01.610> a

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
all three of your hitters okay so as a

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.000 
all three of your hitters okay so as a
serving<00:01:02.360> group<00:01:02.629> we<00:01:03.229> just<00:01:03.470> reversed<00:01:03.860> that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
serving group we just reversed that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.370 
serving group we just reversed that
number<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.269> server<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.689> serving<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.140> team

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
number so if a server is serving a team

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.780 
number so if a server is serving a team
into<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> 1.9<00:01:07.550> or<00:01:07.730> less<00:01:07.940> we're<00:01:08.540> pretty<00:01:08.750> happy

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
into a 1.9 or less we're pretty happy

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.920 
into a 1.9 or less we're pretty happy
above<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.880> 2-point<00:01:11.300> know<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.690> team<00:01:11.900> that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
above a 2-point know that team that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.720 
above a 2-point know that team that
means<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.470> team<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:12.920> system<00:01:13.280> quite<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.490> bit

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
means that team is in system quite a bit

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.220 
means that team is in system quite a bit
and<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.330> want<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.570> make<00:01:14.690> sure<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.960> number

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
and we want to make sure that number

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.330 
and we want to make sure that number
stays<00:01:15.530> low<00:01:16.480> we<00:01:17.480> want<00:01:17.660> to<00:01:17.810> isolate<00:01:18.340> intimidate

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
stays low we want to isolate intimidate

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.360 
stays low we want to isolate intimidate
break<00:01:19.700> down<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> specific<00:01:20.510> player<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:21.070> know<00:01:22.070> Russ

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
break down a specific player I know Russ

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.250 
break down a specific player I know Russ
said<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.760> can<00:01:22.910> try<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.450> break<00:01:23.630> down<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.840> libero

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
said you can try to break down a libero

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.200 
said you can try to break down a libero
not<00:01:24.770> necessarily<00:01:25.280> talking<00:01:25.520> about<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.820> libero

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
not necessarily talking about a libero

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.700 
not necessarily talking about a libero
but<00:01:26.780> I'm<00:01:26.840> talking<00:01:27.110> about<00:01:27.170> breaking<00:01:27.560> down<00:01:27.590> a

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
but I'm talking about breaking down a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.230 
but I'm talking about breaking down a
front<00:01:28.040> row<00:01:28.160> attacker<00:01:28.490> who<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> primary

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
front row attacker who is a primary

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.110 
front row attacker who is a primary
passer<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.020> tryline<00:01:30.380> will<00:01:31.370> often<00:01:31.850> we<00:01:32.000> will

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
passer in the tryline will often we will

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.180 
passer in the tryline will often we will
often<00:01:32.480> stay<00:01:32.810> with<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:32.990> same<00:01:33.380> passer<00:01:33.980> for<00:01:34.159> a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
often stay with that same passer for a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.160 
often stay with that same passer for a
long<00:01:34.430> time<00:01:34.700> throughout<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.030> match<00:01:35.270> while

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
long time throughout a match while

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.050 
long time throughout a match while
throwing<00:01:36.530> little<00:01:36.890> snippets<00:01:37.340> into<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.730> barrel

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
throwing little snippets into the barrel

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.760 
throwing little snippets into the barrel
while<00:01:38.390> they<00:01:38.570> cool<00:01:38.840> off<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:39.560> that's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
while they cool off and I think that's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.240 
while they cool off and I think that's
just<00:01:39.920> really<00:01:40.190> important<00:01:40.730> I<00:01:41.980> think<00:01:42.980> it's<00:01:43.070> also

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
just really important I think it's also

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.920 
just really important I think it's also
important<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.790> consider<00:01:43.820> this<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.659> know<00:01:44.720> we

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
important to consider this and I know we

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.270 
important to consider this and I know we
talked<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.320> them<00:01:45.440> you've<00:01:45.560> heard<00:01:45.740> coaches<00:01:46.130> say

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
talked to them you've heard coaches say

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.219 
talked to them you've heard coaches say
today<00:01:46.520> once<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.000> once<00:01:47.300> your<00:01:47.450> teen<00:01:47.720> takes<00:01:47.990> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
today once the once your teen takes the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.500 
today once the once your teen takes the
floor<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.520> no<00:01:49.850> longer<00:01:49.880> have<00:01:50.330> control

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
floor that you no longer have control

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.719 
floor that you no longer have control
over<00:01:50.840> them<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.530> think<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:51.920> true<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.550> a

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
over them and I think that's true in a

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.730 
over them and I think that's true in a
lot<00:01:52.760> of<00:01:52.940> aspects<00:01:53.540> there's<00:01:54.050> one<00:01:54.170> component

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
lot of aspects there's one component

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.350 
lot of aspects there's one component
that<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.100> still<00:01:55.400> do<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:55.790> believe<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
that you still do and I believe it and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.030 
that you still do and I believe it and
it's<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.659> component<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.200> use<00:01:57.500> as<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> coach

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
it's a component that I use as a coach

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.730 
it's a component that I use as a coach
you<00:01:58.310> don't<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.090> do<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.330> but<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.740> suggest

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you don't have to do this but I suggest

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.000 
you don't have to do this but I suggest
maybe<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.070> consider<00:02:01.460> this<00:02:01.610> today<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:03.140> coach

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
maybe you consider this today is I coach

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.980 
maybe you consider this today is I coach
the<00:02:04.220> game<00:02:04.370> through<00:02:04.760> our<00:02:04.880> servers<00:02:05.330> so

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the game through our servers so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.380 
the game through our servers so
typically<00:02:06.920> what<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.190> do<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.239> head<00:02:08.360> coach

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
typically what I do is as the head coach

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.170 
typically what I do is as the head coach
I<00:02:08.810> will<00:02:08.989> give<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> serving<00:02:09.619> signals<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.340> then

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
I will give the serving signals and then

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.210 
I will give the serving signals and then
I<00:02:11.209> will<00:02:11.450> give<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.690> blocking<00:02:12.140> call<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.709> blocking

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I will give a blocking call a blocking

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.840 
I will give a blocking call a blocking
call<00:02:13.430> relating<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.030> where<00:02:14.300> I'm<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
call relating to where I'm going to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.570 
call relating to where I'm going to
and<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.510> connect<00:02:15.870> those<00:02:16.020> two<00:02:16.050> things<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.890> that

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and I connect those two things and that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.880 
and I connect those two things and that
allows<00:02:17.940> me<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.960> really<00:02:19.290> strong<00:02:19.320> hold

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
allows me to have a really strong hold

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.330 
allows me to have a really strong hold
on<00:02:20.130> my<00:02:20.850> team<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:22.020> way<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> pick<00:02:23.190> apart

just<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.130> jot<00:02:38.340> down<00:02:38.370> notes<00:02:38.580> next<00:02:39.210> time<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
just a jot down notes next time in this

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.060 
just a jot down notes next time in this
rotation<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.740> server

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
rotation I'm going to have this server

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.520 
rotation I'm going to have this server
serve<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.210> particular<00:02:42.600> passer<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
serve this particular passer or this

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.890 
serve this particular passer or this
zone<00:02:43.970> because<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.300> break<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.570> they

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
zone because it's going to break up they

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.420 
zone because it's going to break up they
just<00:02:45.930> ran<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.320> slide<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.920> ran<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.160> down<00:02:47.190> our

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
just ran a slide there ran it down our

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
just ran a slide there ran it down our
throat<00:02:47.730> maybe<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.990> serve<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> short

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
throat maybe I'm going to serve a short

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.580 
throat maybe I'm going to serve a short
ball<00:02:49.680> into<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.130> zone<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.640> break<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.030> up<00:02:51.090> I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
ball into that zone to break that up I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.620 
ball into that zone to break that up I
think<00:02:52.590> having<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> ability<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.600> a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
think having the ability to do that as a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.350 
think having the ability to do that as a
coach<00:02:54.960> once<00:02:55.710> again<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.460> take<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.670> superior

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
coach once again you can take a superior

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.780 
coach once again you can take a superior
team<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.870> break<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:58.770> down<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.640> can

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
team and break them down and you can

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.790 
team and break them down and you can
beat<00:03:00.030> better<00:03:00.270> teams<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.380> than<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
beat better teams and really than you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.750 
beat better teams and really than you

same passion for serving I think it's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.780

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
starting to rally and I think it's a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300 
starting to rally and I think it's a
fantastic<00:03:30.480> skill<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.350> get<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:31.680> good<00:03:31.890> at<00:03:31.950> I

before<00:03:56.640> we<00:03:56.700> get<00:03:56.790> started<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.360> we're<00:03:57.480> on

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
before we get started just so we're on

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.810 
before we get started just so we're on
the<00:03:57.600> same<00:03:57.720> page<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.440> wrote<00:03:59.010> out<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> court<00:03:59.520> here<00:03:59.790> I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
the same page I wrote out a court here I

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.520 
the same page I wrote out a court here I
also<00:04:00.060> put<00:04:00.360> zones<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.020> put<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.320> out

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
also put zones on it I put this out

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.290 
also put zones on it I put this out
because<00:04:01.740> it's<00:04:02.040> probably<00:04:02.340> opposite<00:04:02.940> than<00:04:03.090> most

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
because it's probably opposite than most

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.470 
because it's probably opposite than most
of<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.540> use<00:04:04.070> I've<00:04:05.070> also<00:04:05.310> used<00:04:05.490> different<00:04:06.300> I've

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
of you use I've also used different I've

of you use I've also used different I've
used<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.960> myriad<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.770> different<00:04:07.890> zones<00:04:08.400> but

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
used a myriad of different zones but

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.160 
used a myriad of different zones but
this<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.030> way<00:04:09.330> of<00:04:09.450> looking<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.020> this

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
this is just way of looking at this this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
this is just way of looking at this this
is<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.440> same<00:04:10.650> way<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.860> rotate<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.640> it's<00:04:11.790> one

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is the same way you rotate so it's one

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.820 
is the same way you rotate so it's one
two<00:04:12.060> three<00:04:12.450> four<00:04:12.660> or<00:04:12.750> five<00:04:12.900> six<00:04:13.170> those<00:04:13.410> are<00:04:13.560> six

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
two three four or five six those are six

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.760 
two three four or five six those are six
