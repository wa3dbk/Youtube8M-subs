00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.879 

I<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.450> originally<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.170> into<00:00:13.380> walking<00:00:13.769> I

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I think I originally got into walking I

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.950 
I think I originally got into walking I
suppose<00:00:14.269> although<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> can't<00:00:15.570> say<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
suppose although I can't say that I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
suppose although I can't say that I
hugely<00:00:16.320> enjoyed<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.890> back<00:00:17.070> then<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.270> had

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
hugely enjoyed it back then but I we had

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.560 
hugely enjoyed it back then but I we had
a<00:00:18.449> teacher<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:18.960> school<00:00:19.250> who<00:00:20.250> who<00:00:21.060> ran<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a teacher at our school who who ran and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200 
a teacher at our school who who ran and
who<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.460> qualified<00:00:23.460> Mountain<00:00:23.760> later<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
who was a qualified Mountain later and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
who was a qualified Mountain later and
he<00:00:24.320> ran<00:00:25.320> adventure<00:00:25.769> holidays<00:00:26.070> during<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
he ran adventure holidays during the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
he ran adventure holidays during the
summer<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:28.140> had<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> few<00:00:29.910> Hill

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
summer so we had one of the few Hill

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
summer so we had one of the few Hill
walking<00:00:31.109> clubs<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.859> any<00:00:32.040> school<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:33.230> Dublin<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
walking clubs of any school in Dublin I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.910 
walking clubs of any school in Dublin I
imagined<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> yeah<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:37.110> brother<00:00:37.320> did<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
imagined so yeah my brother did it and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
imagined so yeah my brother did it and
so<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.579> did<00:00:38.640> isn't<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.079> know<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so then I did isn't it was you know it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
so then I did isn't it was you know it
was<00:00:40.620> alright<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.980> seem<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> remember<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
was alright I seem to remember just

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
was alright I seem to remember just
being<00:00:42.540> quite<00:00:42.840> knackered<00:00:43.200> by<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> whole<00:00:43.590> thing

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
being quite knackered by the whole thing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
being quite knackered by the whole thing
but<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.300> probably<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> fact

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but I think probably it was the fact

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.819 
but I think probably it was the fact
that<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:48.530> you're<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.649> letting

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that you're not you're not letting

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
that you're not you're not letting
anybody<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.840> know

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
anybody down if you don't you know

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
anybody down if you don't you know
there's<00:00:52.590> no<00:00:52.710> failing<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> score<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.760> goal<00:00:53.969> or

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
there's no failing to score a goal or

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
there's no failing to score a goal or
anything<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:56.280> long<00:00:56.430> as

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
anything like that it's just as long as

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.380 
anything like that it's just as long as
you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.270> go

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you know where you're going you can go

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
you know where you're going you can go
there<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.899> own<00:00:58.020> pace<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
there at your own pace and so there is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.880 
there at your own pace and so there is
the<00:00:59.070> team<00:00:59.370> aspect<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:01.079> particular

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the team aspect that or particular

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
the team aspect that or particular
competitive<00:01:02.370> aspect<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> think<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> was

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
competitive aspect so I think that was

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
competitive aspect so I think that was
having<00:01:04.890> been<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.309> bad<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:05.939> forms<00:01:06.420> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
having been very bad at all forms of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
having been very bad at all forms of
team<00:01:06.780> sport<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.250> felt<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
team sport and also felt it was a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
team sport and also felt it was a
certain<00:01:08.880> point<00:01:09.030> lessness<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.340> know

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
certain point lessness in in you know

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
certain point lessness in in you know
and<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> field<00:01:13.590> people<00:01:13.770> will

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and I know it's the field people will

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
and I know it's the field people will
say<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.090> Hill<00:01:15.330> walking<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
say the same about Hill walking but the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
say the same about Hill walking but the
just<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.189> whole<00:01:17.340> thing<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.520> playing<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.880> game

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
just the whole thing of playing a game

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.039 
just the whole thing of playing a game
where<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.360> kicking<00:01:18.600> something<00:01:18.750> around

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
where you're kicking something around

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
where you're kicking something around
the<00:01:19.200> place<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:19.650> chasing<00:01:19.920> something<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.400> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the place or chasing something I just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450 
the place or chasing something I just
felt<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.049> don't<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.950> thought<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
felt I don't know I just thought it was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
felt I don't know I just thought it was
silly<00:01:24.119> maybe<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.720> never<00:01:25.080> been<00:01:25.259> any

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
silly maybe because I was never been any

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.270 
silly maybe because I was never been any
good<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.810> whereas<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.979> Hill<00:01:29.100> walking

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
good at it don't whereas to Hill walking

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.980 
good at it don't whereas to Hill walking
even<00:01:29.640> though<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> probably<00:01:30.150> doesn't<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
even though it probably doesn't it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.179 
even though it probably doesn't it
always<00:01:31.140> felt<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.560> I'd<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> sense<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
always felt like I'd had a sense of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.690 
always felt like I'd had a sense of
purpose<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> wasn't<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.100> ages<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
purpose you know it wasn't for ages it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.810 
purpose you know it wasn't for ages it
was<00:01:38.790> probably<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:40.159> six<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.310> seven<00:01:41.579> years

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
was probably about six or seven years

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.090 
was probably about six or seven years
ago<00:01:42.500> not<00:01:43.500> far<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.189> driving<00:01:45.060> towards<00:01:45.420> my
