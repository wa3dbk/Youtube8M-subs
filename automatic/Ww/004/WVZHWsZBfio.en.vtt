00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 mister capuano in short, in the first minutes 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 has started with enough pasting 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.109
 teams a little contracted then came 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.820
 out of the game everyone is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 they waited but I think we did 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.400
 a big match with great dignity 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.839
 with great morality playing on each 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 ball to arezzo also in the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.189
 distribution we were good not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 we risked practically nothing then 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 there have been episodes that have us 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.880
 convicted and the referee leads 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 you probably wo n't propose 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 he was led by this climate 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 cheering because more decisions 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.649
 important 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 they have damaged us considerably 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.090
 dubious episodes on one side from the other 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 mister but the honor of having you is alive 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.510
 granted to Novara few occasions 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 especially in the first half and to be 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 punished for one to zero only by 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 then I don't know tell me the flight 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.809
 probably it was regular I don't know 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 however, the rigor on bonvissuto and arrest 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 don't give it but this is also the goal 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.270
 canceled to armor was regular saying 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 I'm saying maybe it was a moment 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.210
 distracted I didn't see him again and cold 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.040
 nod to cold at natural speed not 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.080
 I noticed and I was convinced and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 I am convinced that offside though if you 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 you tell me so you saw it through i 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 video I have no doubt however the others 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.420
 situations I think the rigor on 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 bonvissuto the first time was rigor and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 expulsion 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 the nine goals born of a foul 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.409
 drive the ball into the corner 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 he took his hands at the ninetieth 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 now I don't remember if he was cold not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.100
 I would like to err but it is part of the game 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.710
 on the 2 on the one to zero in inferiority 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.900
 numerical we had a goal ball 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.759
 Pharaoh with Panariello are fine 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 happy and proud of the performance 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.990
 of my team and I remain thrilled 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.100
 someone when they say they played 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 the match of life 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.250
 you probably don't know Capuano 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.710
 I in my life 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 I wouldn't want to lose on Wednesday either 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 and I repeat if I were the coach of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.920
 novara I would be proud to have won 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.810
 a real match against a team 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580
 important and then does not know and I do not 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.280
 it seems 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.980
 or even trained I trained it was a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.210
 great guy big player e 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.840
 I'm glad it became a 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.840
 great coach
