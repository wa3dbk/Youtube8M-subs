00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.220

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.140
 strength for brazilian college 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.550
 getting back in the gringa rockstar community 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.170
 it can hurt your plate 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.820
 so the question should have been asked 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 this since the first updates of the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.710
 Game enable the pickup option 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.750
 private are in online mode that would 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.140
 help a lot but not this we do not have to 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.179
 oak tree then consists of the following you 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.640
 goes into Creator mode is exactly 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.670
 because it only makes that home of Ozanan that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 happen in the since you will see in the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.929
 creator and you're like someone else's 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.300
 some with fly arriving already can access 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.250
 the menu and see all the game options 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.810
 including join your friends choose 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.520
 characters etc 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.920
 there you can see it's just out of greed 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 of private command where 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.189
 friend who are solo can select 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.439
 deep very fast 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.670
 will now display a method for the 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.720
 history for later in the functions 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.829
 desired 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.500
 You'll see that there's a good difference. 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.170
 you save yourself a few seconds but it's 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.120
 always the best way, the fastest and 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.300
 without coils 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.410
 so come on let's go and let's go 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.410
 get out of gt online 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.380
 this in the last step of a tip from a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.440
 this video or videos copied from the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.000
 whole community Parana malaise 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.060
 all asking for the same rhythms 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.330
 to do this brings options sessions 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 picual campaign mode is to go to the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 mode to win and then enter 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.560
 again an online session 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.480
 if you waste time on average you save 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.850
 precious seven seconds 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.319
 so if you video let him not 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.420
 it costs nothing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.150
 I really like this one favorites 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.920
 Disclosure table getting here remains 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.900

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.900
 peace to all and until the next video
