00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.820 
about it you know I can honestly say
that<00:05:14.500> I<00:05:14.680> think<00:05:15.510> black<00:05:16.510> ops<00:05:16.750> 2<00:05:17.020> will<00:05:17.530> be<00:05:17.650> better

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
that I think black ops 2 will be better

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.750 
that I think black ops 2 will be better
than<00:05:18.040> modern<00:05:18.250> warfare<00:05:18.400> 3<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.740> think<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.310> big

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
than modern warfare 3 and I think a big

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.780 
than modern warfare 3 and I think a big
part<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.210> for<00:05:22.420> me<00:05:22.600> is<00:05:22.840> that<00:05:23.790> zombies

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
part of it for me is that zombies

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.790 
part of it for me is that zombies
zombies<00:05:25.420> has<00:05:25.600> always<00:05:25.930> been<00:05:26.080> great<00:05:26.410> zombies

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
zombies has always been great zombies

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.560 
zombies has always been great zombies

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.220 
has always been my thing I love zombies
on<00:05:28.750> there<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.370> you<00:05:30.370> know<00:05:30.490> just<00:05:31.150> it's<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.780> great

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
on there and you know just it's a great

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.020 
on there and you know just it's a great
part<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.740> game<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.340> love<00:05:33.730> how<00:05:33.910> they

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
part of the game and I love how they

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.460 
part of the game and I love how they
implemented<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:34.990> obviously<00:05:35.110> it's

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
implemented that and obviously it's

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.710 
implemented that and obviously it's
starting<00:05:35.770> world<00:05:35.980> at<00:05:36.070> war<00:05:36.310> merge<00:05:37.210> in<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.540> black

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
starting world at war merge in the black

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.270 
starting world at war merge in the black
ops<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.260> how<00:05:38.350> it's<00:05:38.500> going<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.860> be<00:05:38.950> back<00:05:39.100> in

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
ops and how it's going to be back in

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.900 
ops and how it's going to be back in
black<00:05:39.370> ops<00:05:39.580> 2<00:05:40.290> but<00:05:41.290> i<00:05:41.320> also<00:05:41.410> think<00:05:41.740> black<00:05:42.550> ops<00:05:42.760> 2

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
black ops 2 but i also think black ops 2

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.060 
black ops 2 but i also think black ops 2
is<00:05:43.030> going<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.210> be<00:05:43.300> really<00:05:43.570> good<00:05:43.600> because<00:05:44.070> from

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
is going to be really good because from

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.740 
is going to be really good because from
the<00:05:45.220> first<00:05:45.250> black<00:05:45.700> ops<00:05:45.970> people<00:05:46.540> were

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
the first black ops people were

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.420 
the first black ops people were
skeptical<00:05:47.110> because<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.590> was<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> Triarch<00:05:48.190> game

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
skeptical because it was a Triarch game

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.730 
skeptical because it was a Triarch game
and<00:05:48.670> treyarch<00:05:49.090> swirl<00:05:49.600> that<00:05:49.630> war<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.620> know

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
and treyarch swirl that war and you know

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.380 
and treyarch swirl that war and you know
people<00:05:50.950> compared<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.730> call<00:05:52.090> of<00:05:52.180> duty<00:05:52.360> 4

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
people compared that to call of duty 4

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.390 
people compared that to call of duty 4
and<00:05:52.960> modern<00:05:53.230> warfare<00:05:53.350> 2<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:53.920> they<00:05:54.010> didn't

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
and modern warfare 2 and they didn't

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.090 
and modern warfare 2 and they didn't
like<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.580> compared<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.180> those<00:05:55.300> games<00:05:55.680> now<00:05:56.680> on

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
like it compared to those games now on

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.300 
like it compared to those games now on
in<00:05:58.090> my<00:05:58.360> opinion<00:05:58.630> I<00:05:59.020> think<00:05:59.320> black<00:05:59.860> ops<00:06:00.100> is<00:06:00.250> a

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
in my opinion I think black ops is a

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.250 
in my opinion I think black ops is a
very<00:06:00.550> good<00:06:00.760> game<00:06:00.910> I<00:06:01.060> think<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.360> was<00:06:01.420> stable<00:06:02.080> for

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
very good game I think it was stable for

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.160 
very good game I think it was stable for
the<00:06:02.350> most<00:06:02.530> part<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:04.210> could<00:06:04.660> honestly<00:06:04.840> say

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
the most part and I could honestly say

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.870 
the most part and I could honestly say
but<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.530> think<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.890> like<00:06:05.920> it<00:06:06.250> a<00:06:06.280> little<00:06:06.490> bit<00:06:06.700> more

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
but I think I like it a little bit more

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.470 
but I think I like it a little bit more
than<00:06:07.180> modern<00:06:07.840> warfare<00:06:07.960> 3<00:06:08.140> 1<00:06:09.130> over<00:06:09.370> 2<00:06:09.820> is

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
than modern warfare 3 1 over 2 is

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.280 
than modern warfare 3 1 over 2 is
probably<00:06:11.440> my<00:06:11.680> favorite<00:06:12.780> despite<00:06:13.780> all<00:06:14.020> you

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
probably my favorite despite all you

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.460 
probably my favorite despite all you
know<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:15.460> nukes<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.690> hackers<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:17.350> the
