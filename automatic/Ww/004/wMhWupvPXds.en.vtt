00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
just messing around just to see the new

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
just messing around just to see the new
graphics<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:35.730> pretty<00:00:35.910> cool<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can't record in high detail because my

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
can't record in high detail because my
computer<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> lanky<00:00:41.160> piece<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> shit<00:00:41.670> and

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
bit weird and some of them that were

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.700 
bit weird and some of them that were
saying<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.930> looks<00:01:47.960> better<00:01:48.140> it's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.730 
saying but I think it looks better it's
better<00:01:48.920> graphics<00:01:49.280> anyway<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:51.350> old<00:01:51.500> ones

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
better graphics anyway and the old ones

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.880 
better graphics anyway and the old ones
looked<00:01:52.750> pretty<00:01:53.750> shit<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:55.090> was<00:01:56.090> thinking<00:01:56.240> about

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
looked pretty shit I was thinking about

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.620 
looked pretty shit I was thinking about
banking<00:01:57.890> 99<00:01:58.310> construction<00:01:59.000> because<00:01:59.390> it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
banking 99 construction because it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.810 
banking 99 construction because it's
quite<00:01:59.840> cheaper<00:02:00.259> than<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.310> only<00:02:01.520> take

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
quite cheaper than it and it only take

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.650 
quite cheaper than it and it only take
me<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.000> 40<00:02:02.869> hours<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.350> do<00:02:03.500> which<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.190> I

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
me like 40 hours to do which is like I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.090 
me like 40 hours to do which is like I
didn't<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.720> probably<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.350> weekend<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.009> be
