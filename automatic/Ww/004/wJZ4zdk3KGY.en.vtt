00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.719
 Ah 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:25.340
 Timer a Fixed timer is a time-related padding 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:29.400
 Before we go into the class for the first time in the last hour 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 The market, such as judicial monitoring bovine itguyo example, when you set up 05 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.290
 Timer timer time self timer timer 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 There is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 So here is the timer and hey fixed it a fixed 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.120
 That is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 It is the No. 1 shutter button al 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.070
 That's why autoexposure is evil. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.900
 Let's go inside. 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.820
 When the day would come when the focus what happens press the shutter button 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.799
 This fixed but did not have a cold furnace fixed, so we did until now 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 Whatever works 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.640
 When there are landscapes and people are photographed, 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.120
 Because the focus is on the factories, 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.720
 I need to get out of the building for five seconds. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.830
 How is exposure exposed? 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.870
 Well, the spot is centered in the middle of business or multi- pattern. 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.770
 Off match by reducing the composition of a person to keep to fit on the screen, the map careful measurements 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.110
 It's 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.560
 How Can I change framing shop gets back to the exposure created by the low background 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 Aperture and shutter values ​​will vary as you work 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.730
 If you enter this mission backlight and the backlight back as I would face conditions moment 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.120
 When I caught it, it was in a notebook that was appropriate for weaving . 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.800
 It turns into an exposure in the background . 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:07.950
 What's in a mode that'll see you in accordance with the specimen shirts ttwilkka s 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:13.349
 In the mode, the aperture value is comfortable and the marketer changes odorlessly. 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:19.230
 So when the module swapped to compose a single shutter keeps focusing not only see 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:24.660
 This is the way to lock the exposure together . 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 The focus is fixed at the moment you press the shutter button, but the iris and soto values ​​are also irregular. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.700
 I get less . 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:35.880
 Even if you change the composition, the focus and exposure remain the same as the first half-shutter at any moment 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.170
 The setting is correct and I'm shooting. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:45.269
 So when taking backlit photos Do specialties are outside Chalmers is also why its failure 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:50.160
 Your face will be proud of your total exposure. 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:53.459
 This time, I have a menu with a half-dead timer time. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.349
 There's a lot of time to go inside. 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:03.569
 Four seconds and six seconds . 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:07.500
 Basically talking 6000's default is six seconds mwonyamyeon 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:11.220
 It's the aperture and shutter values. The meter is working now. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.290
 When six sets pass, they cook and disappear. 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.640
 Also it'll cycle is glad that that is not going to determine who contributed to that time 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.329
 If you make it a little bit longer, the aperture shutter will stay on and keep the window 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:30.900
 In case you get out of the room a little quicker. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:34.380
 If you are taking a picture of a rose, this half- flow timer will raise the dog 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.530
 I have a lot of uncomfortable moments when I go home. 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.900
 So it's the perfect place for any m-mode fixed aperture or shutter to write 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.120
 When you continue shooting, 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:54.299
 There is no limit, but a little longer 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 This is a method that can be used without knowing the schedule on both axes 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:01.739
 There are features such as 3x f type. 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.940
 The self-timer can be used Ju-On May 4th it is largely divided into two 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.069
 I will. 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:11.069
 I do not have anyone to take a tripod, so I just take 3 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.810
 If you are shooting pro second 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.799
 If you do not have a release and you shoot instead of militia, you can divide into two 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.909
 There will be. 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.909
 Let's go in every year. 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.199
 Three are coming'm Jeff Burr tie between latency of shots will be taken Vehicles 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.190
 Interval There are three 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.810
 Let's enter set time into waiting time 2 seconds 5 seconds 10 seconds 20 seconds 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.430
 There are four things. 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:44.560
 If you guys do not have a release, 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:49.960
 The'd better choose a convenient self-timer When you spend yidaejin 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:55.449
 Because it's just a t key, it's only after this second. 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:59.830
 It would be much more advantageous to take a shot or set it up a bit longer in this case . 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:04.449
 You can cut the number of shots when you come down under the shade 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:10.330
 Large number itneyo can continue to shoot nine kinds of exercises in one cut 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:16.900
 If you take a group photo If you have been pressing whenever you went rotten cow I toss one banbuk 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:21.360
 Kids just press ok will also place approximately 9 to select a crocus without 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.360
 The release mode above 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:31.790
 Timetable What's on the clock Must change to self timer 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:37.610
 The song function works. You can use the self timer as a tile . 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.050
 Inter have taken part because punishment is to regulate the amount of time doing what we connectors are 4 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.650
 As comfortable 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:46.650
 It will set us to fit the situation 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.650
 or
