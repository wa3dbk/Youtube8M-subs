00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
have patched a Windows 10 already with a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
have patched a Windows 10 already with a
tool<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:06.110> allows<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.439> sort<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.680> turn<00:02:07.950> off

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
tool that allows you to sort of turn off

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.530 
tool that allows you to sort of turn off
drivers<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.149> crashing<00:02:10.190> your<00:02:11.540> machine

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
drivers that are crashing your machine

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.750 
drivers that are crashing your machine
so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.740 
so
it's<00:02:14.760> been<00:02:14.940> interesting<00:02:15.150> I've<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.720> know

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's been interesting I've you know

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's been interesting I've you know
obviously<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.380> I've<00:02:16.530> been<00:02:16.680> running<00:02:16.860> Windows

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
obviously like I've been running Windows

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760 
obviously like I've been running Windows
10<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:18.630> primary<00:02:18.990> desktop<00:02:19.290> forever<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
10 on my primary desktop forever I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.470 
10 on my primary desktop forever I
really<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.300> lot<00:02:21.420> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
really like it I think for a lot of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.240 
really like it I think for a lot of
people<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.230> funny<00:02:22.440> because<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:23.070> didn't

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
people it's funny because what didn't

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
people it's funny because what didn't
realize<00:02:23.430> until<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.750> was<00:02:24.840> actually<00:02:24.960> talking<00:02:25.170> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
realize until I was actually talking to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.990 
realize until I was actually talking to
will<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:25.920> tested<00:02:26.340> today<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> way<00:02:26.820> they're

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
will and tested today is the way they're

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.210 
will and tested today is the way they're
rolling<00:02:27.300> out<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.780> software<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.770> reason

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
rolling out the software is the reason

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
rolling out the software is the reason
they're<00:02:29.490> staging<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.660> release<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.230> is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
they're staging the the release of it is

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.480 
they're staging the the release of it is
not<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.710> because<00:02:32.010> they're<00:02:32.160> trying<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.370> get

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
not just because they're trying to get

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.400 
not just because they're trying to get
it<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> million<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.240> billion<00:02:33.600> machine<00:02:34.110> which

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it on a million a billion machine which

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
it on a million a billion machine which
is<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.860> fantastic<00:02:35.430> marketing<00:02:35.790> number

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
is kind of a fantastic marketing number

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.990 
is kind of a fantastic marketing number
but<00:02:36.630> because<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.790> looking<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:38.910> your

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
but because they are looking at your

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.460 
but because they are looking at your
machine<00:02:39.300> figuring<00:02:39.690> out<00:02:39.750> what's<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
machine figuring out what's on it and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.680 
machine figuring out what's on it and
then<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:42.120> everything<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.600> your

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
then if they know everything on your

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.360 
then if they know everything on your
machine<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.930> compatible<00:02:43.710> then<00:02:44.040> they're

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
machine is compatible then they're

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.520 
machine is compatible then they're
giving<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.330> three<00:02:45.780> gigabyte<00:02:46.140> download

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
giving you the three gigabyte download

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.800 
giving you the three gigabyte download
to<00:02:46.650> install<00:02:46.920> Windows<00:02:47.220> 10<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> if<00:02:48.600> your

to install Windows 10 and if your

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
to install Windows 10 and if your
machine<00:02:49.020> has<00:02:49.740> hardware<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.430> known<00:02:50.580> issues

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
machine has hardware with known issues

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.350 
machine has hardware with known issues
they<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.300> delaying<00:02:51.860> until<00:02:52.860> those<00:02:53.850> repairs

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
they are delaying until those repairs

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.170 
they are delaying until those repairs
are<00:02:54.720> made<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
fascinating release it's a completely

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.980 
fascinating release it's a completely
different<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.820> Microsoft<00:03:00.510> has<00:03:00.570> built<00:03:00.840> this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
different way Microsoft has built this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.360 
different way Microsoft has built this
operating<00:03:01.380> system<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.160> really

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
operating system you know it's a really

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.290 
operating system you know it's a really
big<00:03:05.580> change<00:03:06.920> for<00:03:07.920> how<00:03:08.100> Microsoft<00:03:08.820> handles

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
big change for how Microsoft handles

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.440 
big change for how Microsoft handles
things<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.780> lot<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.050> ways<00:03:10.200> um<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:11.640> don't<00:03:12.270> know

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
things in a lot of ways um I don't know

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
things in a lot of ways um I don't know
I<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.140> lot<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:14.220> know<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> probably

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
I like it a lot you know I probably

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.430 
I like it a lot you know I probably
wouldn't<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.720> what<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.930> did<00:03:16.230> which<00:03:16.260> was

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
wouldn't do what I did which was

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.840 
wouldn't do what I did which was
immediately<00:03:16.800> installing<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.820> I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
immediately installing it you know I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.940 
immediately installing it you know I
again<00:03:18.390> I've<00:03:18.510> been<00:03:18.630> installing<00:03:19.380> I'm<00:03:19.650> running

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
again I've been installing I'm running

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.580 
again I've been installing I'm running
it<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.100> my<00:03:20.220> primary<00:03:20.640> machine<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:21.120> months<00:03:21.590> I'd

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it on my primary machine for months I'd

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.020 
it on my primary machine for months I'd
probably<00:03:22.769> ease<00:03:23.100> my<00:03:23.310> way<00:03:23.459> into<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:26.000> although<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
probably ease my way into it although I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.699 
probably ease my way into it although I
will<00:03:27.269> say<00:03:27.300> if<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.750> start<00:03:28.080> using<00:03:28.170> Windows<00:03:28.500> 10

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
will say if you start using Windows 10

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.080 
will say if you start using Windows 10
you'll<00:03:28.890> probably<00:03:29.070> find<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.430> impossible<00:03:29.580> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
you'll probably find it impossible to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.290 
you'll probably find it impossible to
use<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> Windows<00:03:31.019> 8<00:03:31.260> machine
