 Oh, this is really not what I'm really the meantime I managed to images 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:23.250
 When you really work, you have to give the other guy a feeling of love 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 Because I just can not afford 3 kkoso baby is never too busy at night 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.950

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.100
 To be honest, I am happier in the subject. 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.840
 Now, ten. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:40.489
 Now that you 've lived, you'll have a hard time loving it for the time being . 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.879
 Because there are many things I want to do, 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:50.750
 I usually want to be a first in three world choreographers. 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.280

 Reumyeon chair right now, so eat more apartments every year 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.159
 I heard that it was a breakdown or a stagnation. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 At last I finally got to say something. 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.399
 Do you know how to speak North Korean after my hand ? 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.399
 MD Now which President doengeol tteobeul wasted what happens to take 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.700

 The tuna is floating. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.870
 It's been a while since then. 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.440
 We'll have 11 minutes a day. We'll try to concentrate. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 The summer hurricane is the first time when it is clear 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.360
 I was challenged to act 5 but I was told that I did not like it 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.060
 I remember it. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:38.069
 I got a lot of it, and then I was really hard to die as I was taking the typhoon . 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:43.500
 Because I had a feeling of burden, and I did not have the desire to be good. 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 It was the right thing to not go over because it was my first major acting 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.739
 Because I had no experience in acting before that , I knew so well. 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.920
 Because of this, you will have to learn to flip an electrode and have a long respiratory weekend 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:00.900
 I thought I was a little slow here. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:06.960
 You can see it collapse a bit , but when you look at a bigger picture 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:12.720
 By choosing the nation, I would have to lay a foundation 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:17.610
 Yes, so I was greedy for good works, but I was a little harder 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.510
 I waited patiently, polished and wiped , and when I met a better work, 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.710
 Frost decided to go back to America 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.160
