00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
little off to the side it so it's kind

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.090 
little off to the side it so it's kind
of<00:03:48.730> unique<00:03:49.570> but<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.410> smooth<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:50.920> runs

of unique but it's smooth and it runs
great<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:51.820> then<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> go<00:03:52.239> into<00:03:52.390> settings

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.920 
great but then if you go into settings
and<00:03:53.890> see<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.340> video<00:03:54.550> here<00:03:54.760> up<00:03:55.420> top<00:03:55.660> we

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
and see this on video here up top we

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.100 
and see this on video here up top we
have<00:03:56.110> mode<00:03:56.680> change<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.850> see<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.330> there<00:03:58.630> what

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
have mode change you see that there what

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.440 
have mode change you see that there what
that<00:03:59.140> does<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.739> give<00:03:59.980> us<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.370> regular<00:04:01.090> standard

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
that does is give us a regular standard

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
that does is give us a regular standard
mode<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.930> then<00:04:02.140> what<00:04:02.350> they<00:04:02.470> called<00:04:02.769> starter

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
mode and then what they called starter

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.400 
mode and then what they called starter
mode<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:04.120> not<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.390> lot<00:04:04.720> different<00:04:04.750> but<00:04:05.290> it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
mode it's not a lot different but it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.020 
mode it's not a lot different but it
basically<00:04:05.739> makes<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.190> easier<00:04:06.550> for<00:04:06.580> those<00:04:06.880> that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
basically makes it easier for those that

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.130 
basically makes it easier for those that
