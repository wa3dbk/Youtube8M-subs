you want to talk now this is what it
looks<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.120> if<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.329> dig<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> hear<00:00:42.989> your

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
looks like so if you dig to hear your

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.760 
looks like so if you dig to hear your

tree branch what are you whatever you
want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> call<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> dig

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
want to call now this you want to dig

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.459 
want to call now this you want to dig
straight<00:00:53.149> across<00:00:54.149> making<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.840> main<00:00:55.079> tree

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
straight across making your main tree

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.670 
straight across making your main tree
trunk<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> tree<00:00:56.670> trunk<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.680> once

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
trunk this is the tree trunk and once

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.080 
trunk this is the tree trunk and once
you<00:00:58.829> dig<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> tree<00:00:59.370> trunks<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you dig the tree trunks you want to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.889 
you dig the tree trunks you want to
drink<00:01:00.270> dig<00:01:01.129> branches<00:01:02.129> off<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.660> each

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
drink dig branches off of it on each

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.310 
drink dig branches off of it on each
side<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.090> every<00:01:06.930> three

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
side there and there and every three

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.540 
side there and there and every three
blocks<00:01:08.360> start<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.510> new<00:01:09.720> branch

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
blocks start a new branch

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.670 
blocks start a new branch
and<00:01:13.550> if<00:01:13.970> you're<00:01:14.120> wondering<00:01:14.150> why<00:01:14.780> every<00:01:15.440> three

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
and if you're wondering why every three

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.740 
and if you're wondering why every three
blocks<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.370> because<00:01:17.180> diamonds<00:01:17.810> were<00:01:18.560> mostly

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
blocks and because diamonds were mostly

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.160 
blocks and because diamonds were mostly
today<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:22.220> they're<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.580> there<00:01:23.390> very<00:01:23.420> very

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
today and if they're in there very very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.500 
today and if they're in there very very
rarely<00:01:24.530> only<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.490> middle<00:01:25.760> diamonds<00:01:26.300> and

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
rarely only in the middle diamonds and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.020 
rarely only in the middle diamonds and
the<00:01:27.440> Diamonds<00:01:27.890> will<00:01:28.100> wrap<00:01:28.310> around<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the Diamonds will wrap around the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.350 
the Diamonds will wrap around the
diamond<00:01:29.630> vein<00:01:30.020> will<00:01:30.530> go<00:01:30.740> from<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.880> middle<00:01:32.180> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
diamond vein will go from the middle to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.330 
diamond vein will go from the middle to
the<00:01:32.960> side<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.500> as<00:01:33.710> your<00:01:34.160> mind<00:01:34.370> you'll<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:35.320> then

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
the side so as your mind you'll see then

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.740 
the side so as your mind you'll see then
now<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.460> can<00:01:37.610> make<00:01:37.760> as<00:01:38.000> long<00:01:38.210> as<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.540> want

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
now you can make as long as you want

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.940 
now you can make as long as you want
down<00:01:39.940> as<00:01:40.940> long<00:01:41.210> as<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.450> want<00:01:41.660> as<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.380> want<00:01:42.560> far

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
down as long as you want as you want far

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.410 
down as long as you want as you want far
away<00:01:44.200> mine's<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.530> fairly<00:01:45.950> large<00:01:46.610> diamond<00:01:47.240> line

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
away mine's a fairly large diamond line

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.600 
away mine's a fairly large diamond line
but<00:01:47.660> I<00:01:47.840> got<00:01:48.080> loads<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.500> diamonds<00:01:48.920> out<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.310> if

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
but I got loads of diamonds out of it if

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.300 
but I got loads of diamonds out of it if
you're<00:01:49.790> wondering<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.860> method<00:01:52.100> does

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
you're wondering so this method does

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.330 
you're wondering so this method does
work<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.420> you'll<00:01:53.570> find<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.870> all<00:01:54.160> also<00:01:55.160> what's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
work and you'll find it all also what's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.590 
work and you'll find it all also what's
up<00:01:55.550> redstone<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.130> cool<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.760> just<00:01:59.300> feel<00:01:59.450> free

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
up redstone and cool so just feel free

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.770 
up redstone and cool so just feel free
to<00:02:00.050> get<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.410> too<00:02:00.620> as<00:02:00.830> you're<00:02:01.070> digging<00:02:01.780> so

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
to get that too as you're digging so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.340 
to get that too as you're digging so
that's<00:02:03.170> basically<00:02:03.380> I'm<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.490> how<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.880> get

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
that's basically I'm that's how to get

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.120 
that's basically I'm that's how to get
the<00:02:06.550> Diamonds<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.850> easiest<00:02:08.390> bike<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.890> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the Diamonds the easiest bike and if you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.699 
the Diamonds the easiest bike and if you
want<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.610> after<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.150> do<00:02:12.050> your<00:02:12.260> little<00:02:12.500> mind

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
want to after you do your little mind

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.920 
want to after you do your little mind
down<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.610> can<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:13.820> go<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.450> few

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
down there you can just go up a few

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.440 
down there you can just go up a few
blocks<00:02:15.110> because<00:02:16.010> diamonds<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:16.820> from<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
blocks because diamonds go from the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.010 
blocks because diamonds go from the
bottom<00:02:17.630> which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.500> 0<00:02:19.220> 2<00:02:19.340> 16<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.989> just

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020
