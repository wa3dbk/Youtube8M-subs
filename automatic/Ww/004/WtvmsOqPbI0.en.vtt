00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
armor was gather I mean the way the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
us assume it was gather in the armor but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
us assume it was gather in the armor but
to<00:02:37.260> find<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.709> at<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> end<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> episode<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
to find out at the end of the episode it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.870

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the end of the episode that was pretty

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.540

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
badass so here's the thing I like the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
badass so here's the thing I like the
anime<00:02:47.970> original<00:02:48.330> scene<00:02:48.510> -<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.660> was<00:02:48.989> good<00:02:49.170> ok<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
anime original scene - it was good ok I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190 
anime original scene - it was good ok I
will<00:02:49.980> say<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.220> was<00:02:50.310> good<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:51.080> there's<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
will say it was good but there's a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.680 
will say it was good but there's a
couple<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.739> things<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.100> want<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.370> mention

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
couple of things I do want to mention

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.190

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
they they actually took out one point of

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.360 
they they actually took out one point of
actual<00:03:01.200> major<00:03:01.380> plot<00:03:01.680> point<00:03:01.950> that's<00:03:02.130> probably

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
actual major plot point that's probably

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.250

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.839 
decided to completely just axe that out
and<00:04:42.389> put<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.169> where<00:04:43.349> shelter<00:04:44.220> was<00:04:44.400> caring

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
and put it to where shelter was caring

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.260 
and put it to where shelter was caring
for<00:04:45.090> his<00:04:45.690> armor<00:04:46.289> pretty<00:04:46.560> much<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.099> that<00:04:48.000> was

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
for his armor pretty much and that was

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.430 
for his armor pretty much and that was
technically<00:04:48.720> what<00:04:49.020> happened<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:50.009> I<00:04:51.229> will<00:04:52.229> get

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
technically what happened so I will get

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.320 
technically what happened so I will get
into<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.800> actual<00:04:53.099> ending<00:04:53.490> conclusion<00:04:54.150> of

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
into the actual ending conclusion of

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.050 
into the actual ending conclusion of
that<00:04:54.389> plot<00:04:55.020> point<00:04:55.379> until<00:04:55.889> after<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:56.580> arc<00:04:56.909> is

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that plot point until after this arc is

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.749 
that plot point until after this arc is
done<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.479> case<00:04:57.810> they<00:04:58.080> decide<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:59.099> add<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.550> which

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
done in case they decide to add it which

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.040 
done in case they decide to add it which
I<00:04:59.880> highly<00:05:00.030> doubt<00:05:00.270> because<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.750> way<00:05:00.870> the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
I highly doubt because the way the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.330 
I highly doubt because the way the
events<00:05:01.380> were<00:05:01.500> displayed<00:05:01.919> they<00:05:02.130> can't

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
events were displayed they can't

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.820 
events were displayed they can't
possibly<00:05:02.880> add<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:03.569> now<00:05:03.780> because<00:05:04.050> there's

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
possibly add that in now because there's

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.409 
possibly add that in now because there's
certain<00:05:05.130> conversations<00:05:05.819> that<00:05:06.030> should<00:05:06.270> have

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
certain conversations that should have

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.820 
certain conversations that should have
