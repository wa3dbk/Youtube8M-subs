00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.733
Maiden ! Maiden ! Maiden !

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.733
Maiden ! Maiden ! Maiden !

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Maiden ! Maiden...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi !

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm waiting

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.066
in my cold cell,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
when the bell

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.066
begins to chime.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Reflecting

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.066
on my past life,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
and it doesn't

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
have much time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.333
'Cause at 5 o'clock,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
they take me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.466
to the gallows pole...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
The sands of time,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.733
for me, are running low...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Running low...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yeah !

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.200
When the priest comes to read me the last rites,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.266
I take a look through the bars at the last sights

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of a world that has gone very wrong for me...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.866
Can it be that there's some sort of error ?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.400
Hard to stop the surmounting terror,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.066
is this really the end, not some crazy dream ?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.933
Somebody please, tell me that I'm dreaming !

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.466
It's not easy to stop from screaming,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.466
words escape me, as I try to speak...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.200
Tears flow, but why am I crying ?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.466
After all, I'm not afraid of dying...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.933
Don't I believe that there never is an end ?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.933
As the guards march me out to the courtyard,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.200
somebody cries from a cell : "God be with you !"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.733
If there's a God, why does he let me go ?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.533
As I walk, my life drifts before me...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.533
Though the end is near, I'm not sorry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.400
Catch my soul, willing to fly away !

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.800
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.933
Don't worry now, I have gone.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.400
I've gone beyond to see the truth...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Yeah ! Yeah !

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.066
When you know that your time is close at hand,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.733
maybe then, you'll begin to understand...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.933
Life down here is just a strange illusion...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Come on !

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.600
Scream for me Roskilde !

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.600
Scream for me Roskilde !

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.600
Scream for me Roskilde !

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Yeah...

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.466
Hallowed be Thy name !

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Yeah...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.333
Hallowed Thy name...

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah...

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yeah...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yeah ! Yeah ...

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yeah...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[???]

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[???]

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[???]

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.933
That's it, thank you to all !

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.200
