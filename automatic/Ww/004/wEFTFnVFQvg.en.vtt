probably move ahead and get married so I
I<00:01:40.430> would<00:01:40.670> say<00:01:40.909> with<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.299> lot<00:01:41.570> challenging<00:01:42.289> but

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
I would say with a lot challenging but

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.050 
I would say with a lot challenging but
it<00:01:42.890> was<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:43.399> had<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.820> little

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
it was I think one had to be a little

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760 
it was I think one had to be a little
more<00:01:44.210> natural<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.930> do<00:01:45.079> this<00:01:45.229> because<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.619> was<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
more natural to do this because it was a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670 
more natural to do this because it was a
very<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.670> lot<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.329> women<00:01:47.659> would<00:01:47.810> associated<00:01:48.500> I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
very a lot of women would associated I

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.350 
very a lot of women would associated I
think<00:01:49.189> one<00:01:49.340> had<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.579> be<00:01:49.610> as<00:01:49.820> natural<00:01:50.240> as

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
think one had to be as natural as

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.969 
think one had to be as natural as
possible<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.140> think<00:01:51.320> that's<00:01:51.439> what<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.649> tried

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
possible and I think that's what I tried

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.919 
possible and I think that's what I tried
to<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:54.399> Farrar<00:01:55.399> talking<00:01:55.909> about<00:01:56.179> working<00:01:56.600> with

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
to do Farrar talking about working with

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.230 
to do Farrar talking about working with
and<00:01:57.079> run<00:01:57.259> off<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.710> little<00:01:57.920> feisty<00:01:58.340> panties<00:01:59.030> for

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and run off a little feisty panties for

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.910 
and run off a little feisty panties for
use<00:01:59.509> in<00:01:59.720> for<00:01:59.899> where<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.110> have<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.409> answers<00:02:00.740> by

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
use in for where you have the answers by

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
use in for where you have the answers by
working<00:02:01.189> with<00:02:01.429> it<00:02:01.549> now<00:02:02.179> at<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:02.659> because<00:02:02.929> I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
working with it now at all because I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.559 
working with it now at all because I
think<00:02:03.740> whatever<00:02:04.280> relent<00:02:04.729> interacted<00:02:05.479> with

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
think whatever relent interacted with

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.020 
think whatever relent interacted with
abroad<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.470> know<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:07.189> think<00:02:07.280> he's<00:02:07.819> my

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
abroad I think you know I think he's my

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.089 
abroad I think you know I think he's my
quasi<00:02:08.509> like<00:02:08.630> quiet<00:02:08.869> person<00:02:09.440> initially<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
quasi like quiet person initially and

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.500 
quasi like quiet person initially and
even<00:02:10.369> are<00:02:10.489> pretty<00:02:10.729> reserved<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.269> think<00:02:11.360> it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
even are pretty reserved so I think it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.420 
even are pretty reserved so I think it
took<00:02:11.599> us<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.989> little<00:02:12.530> while<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:13.069> get<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> know

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
took us a little while to get to know

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.890 
took us a little while to get to know
each<00:02:13.580> other<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.030> think<00:02:14.180> once<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.510> do<00:02:14.720> get

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
each other but I think once you do get

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.680 
each other but I think once you do get
to<00:02:15.080> know<00:02:15.110> him<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:16.000> he's<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.150> very<00:02:17.180> very

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
to know him I think he's a very very

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.180 
to know him I think he's a very very
loud<00:02:18.140> person<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:18.739> can<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.160> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
loud person one can just have a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
loud person one can just have a
conversation<00:02:19.280> with<00:02:19.910> him<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.660> I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
conversation with him so not at all I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.570 
conversation with him so not at all I
think<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.410> gotta<00:02:21.590> learn<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.040> much<00:02:22.190> from<00:02:22.370> him

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
think one gotta learn so much from him

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.220 
think one gotta learn so much from him
in<00:02:22.700> terms<00:02:22.849> you're<00:02:23.090> given<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.930> he<00:02:24.019> has<00:02:24.110> an

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
in terms you're given and he has an

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.960 
in terms you're given and he has an
actor<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> think<00:02:24.860> he's<00:02:24.950> award<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.519> much<00:02:25.760> which

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
actor I think he's award so much which

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.280 
actor I think he's award so much which
is<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.209> amount<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.019> of<00:02:27.080> work<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
is the amount of the kind of work that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.319 
is the amount of the kind of work that
he's<00:02:27.590> also<00:02:27.769> done<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.130> think<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.579> got<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.910> learn<00:02:29.030> so

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
he's also done I think I got to learn so

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.710 
he's also done I think I got to learn so
much<00:02:29.829> are<00:02:30.829> you<00:02:31.040> open<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.610> reality<00:02:32.209> lenient

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
much are you open to reality lenient

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.960 
much are you open to reality lenient
while<00:02:32.930> something<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:34.220> big<00:02:34.430> bar<00:02:34.640> I

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
while something on that is a big bar I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.210 
while something on that is a big bar I
don't<00:02:35.269> know<00:02:35.599> exactly<00:02:35.780> reality<00:02:36.560> TV<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:36.950> pretty

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
don't know exactly reality TV is pretty

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.270 
don't know exactly reality TV is pretty
big<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.599> think<00:02:39.530> today<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.950> lot<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.190> people

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
big but I think today a lot of people

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.199 
big but I think today a lot of people
are<00:02:40.700> doing<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.000> good<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:42.100> think<00:02:43.100> right<00:02:43.519> now<00:02:43.549> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
are doing that good I think right now to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.849 
are doing that good I think right now to
the<00:02:44.299> first<00:02:44.480> time<00:02:44.690> I'm<00:02:44.870> very<00:02:44.900> much<00:02:45.350> focused

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
the first time I'm very much focused

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.460 
the first time I'm very much focused
about<00:02:46.160> doing<00:02:46.700> work<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.329> about<00:02:47.660> my<00:02:47.870> film<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.440> I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
about doing work and about my film so I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.140 
about doing work and about my film so I
think<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.739> should<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.340> keep<00:02:49.459> my<00:02:49.640> focus<00:02:49.850> on

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
think I should really keep my focus on

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.359 
think I should really keep my focus on
this
