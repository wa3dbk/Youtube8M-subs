most pilots for fourth heiress will
probably<00:00:13.440> also<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.889> shown<00:00:14.190> with<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.639> million

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
probably also be shown with some million

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
probably also be shown with some million
signing<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> wanted<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.039> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
signing for but what I wanted to do this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.330 
signing for but what I wanted to do this
we<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.640> want<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> talk<00:00:18.510> about<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.990> my

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
we do want to talk about the my

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
we do want to talk about the my
expectation<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.300> pharaohs<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.020> what

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
expectation from a for pharaohs and what

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.529 
expectation from a for pharaohs and what
they<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> would<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.150> theros

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
they what I would like to see in theros

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.679 
they what I would like to see in theros
and<00:00:25.199> also<00:00:25.470> hear<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.980> were<00:00:26.160> Jewish

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
and also hear what you were Jewish

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.970 
and also hear what you were Jewish
expectations<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.019> fourth<00:00:28.320> errors<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
expectations would be fourth errors and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.939 
expectations would be fourth errors and
what<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.220> thoughts<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:30.320> theros<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> way

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
what your thoughts on theros in a way

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.520 
what your thoughts on theros in a way
here<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:32.460> expectations<00:00:33.230> what<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> really

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
here are my expectations what I really

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
here are my expectations what I really
hope<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.890> theros<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
hope for theros is that it's going to be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420 
hope for theros is that it's going to be
a<00:00:36.390> blog<00:00:37.020> dad<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.800> they're<00:00:38.160> going

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
a blog dad not that's not they're going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.940 
a blog dad not that's not they're going
to<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.700> focused<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> creature<00:00:39.930> heavy<00:00:40.260> blog

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to be focused on a creature heavy blog

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450 
to be focused on a creature heavy blog
which<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.149> felt<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> return<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> ravnica<00:00:43.890> did<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
which I felt the return to ravnica did a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760 
which I felt the return to ravnica did a
lot<00:00:44.730> especially<00:00:45.230> gatecrash<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
lot especially gatecrash with the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
lot especially gatecrash with the
evolved<00:00:47.180> Italian<00:00:48.180> blood<00:00:48.989> rush<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.530> extort<00:00:50.840> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
evolved Italian blood rush and extort it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.510 
evolved Italian blood rush and extort it
wasn't<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.649> were<00:00:52.770> bad<00:00:52.949> mechanics

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
wasn't because there were bad mechanics

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
wasn't because there were bad mechanics
it<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.530> were

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it was just that because they were

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
it was just that because they were
mechanics<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.449> focused<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
mechanics that that focused on on

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.029 
mechanics that that focused on on
creatures<00:00:59.039> the<00:01:00.079> holy<00:01:01.079> return<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.680> ravnica

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
creatures the holy return to ravnica

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.709 
creatures the holy return to ravnica
block<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.489> had<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> lot<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
block just had to have a lot of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
block just had to have a lot of
creatures<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.710> made<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.250> really

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
creatures in it which made it I really

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
creatures in it which made it I really
creature<00:01:06.390> heavy<00:01:06.689> block<00:01:06.979> it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.189> like

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
creature heavy block it's not that like

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
creature heavy block it's not that like
I<00:01:08.790> hate<00:01:09.030> creatures<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.200> always<00:01:10.890> liked<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I hate creatures but I always liked the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
I hate creatures but I always liked the
the<00:01:12.180> enjoyment<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> artifacts<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.770> on

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the enjoyment and artifacts and so on

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
the enjoyment and artifacts and so on
way<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.400> than<00:01:14.820> creatures<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.320> why<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
way more than creatures which were why I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
way more than creatures which were why I
like<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> overload<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.970> decipher<00:01:18.900> mechanic

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like the overload and decipher mechanic

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
like the overload and decipher mechanic
a<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.680> though<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.700> cipher<00:01:21.060> mechanic

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
a lot more though the cipher mechanic

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
a lot more though the cipher mechanic
turn<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:23.040> bad

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
turn out to be a really a really bad

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.149 
turn out to be a really a really bad
thing<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.970> thought<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.799> overload

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
thing I thought that the the overload

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
thing I thought that the the overload
and<00:01:26.340> cipher<00:01:26.700> mechanic<00:01:27.119> brought<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and cipher mechanic brought a little

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
and cipher mechanic brought a little
more<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> table<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> creature

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
more to the table than these a creature

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.190 
more to the table than these a creature
heavy<00:01:31.070> mechanics<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.189> had<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.930> 4k<00:01:33.930> crazy

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
heavy mechanics we had for 4k crazy

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
heavy mechanics we had for 4k crazy
mature<00:01:34.470> into<00:01:34.740> replica<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> also<00:01:36.030> why<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
mature into replica this is also why I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.289 
mature into replica this is also why I
really<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> try<00:01:37.710> theros<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> block

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
really want to try theros be a block

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.920 
really want to try theros be a block
where<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.350> mechanics<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.610> some

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
where the mechanics are going to be some

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.910 
where the mechanics are going to be some
something<00:01:42.930> we'll<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.799> little

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
something we'll have to think a little

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.480 
something we'll have to think a little
and<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:45.000> creature<00:01:45.299> heavy<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> course

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and also creature heavy it's of course

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
and also creature heavy it's of course
really<00:01:47.759> hard<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> speculate<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.869> which

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
really hard to speculate on which

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.700 
really hard to speculate on which
mechanics<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.899> Ferris

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
mechanics are going to be in in Ferris

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
mechanics are going to be in in Ferris
but<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> mechanic<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.119> been<00:01:54.299> thinking<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
but a mechanic I have been thinking of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
but a mechanic I have been thinking of
that<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.560> cool<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.700> new

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that could be really cool as it's a new

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.080 
that could be really cool as it's a new
version<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> level<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> mechanic<00:01:58.259> where

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
version of the level of mechanic where

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
version of the level of mechanic where
where<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.719> creature<00:02:00.930> developed<00:02:01.680> for

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
where if a creature developed for

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
where if a creature developed for
certain<00:02:02.159> points<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.850> could<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
certain points or they could also be in

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.709 
certain points or they could also be in
germinal<00:02:04.380> artifact<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> matter

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
germinal artifact for that matter

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.740 
germinal artifact for that matter
leveled<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.079> certain<00:02:07.500> points<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
leveled up to a certain points and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.790 
leveled up to a certain points and
and<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.979> know<00:02:10.009> reads<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:11.020> divinity<00:02:12.020> are

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
and and you know reads the divinity are

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.640 
and and you know reads the divinity are
cold<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.520> whatever<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.000> want<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.240> say<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
cold or whatever you want to say the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.950 
cold or whatever you want to say the
this<00:02:16.250> level<00:02:17.000> up<00:02:17.320> card<00:02:18.320> would<00:02:18.590> would<00:02:19.340> change<00:02:19.960> to

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
this level up card would would change to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.180 
this level up card would would change to
a<00:02:20.990> specific<00:02:21.560> guard<00:02:22.690> card<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.170> could<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
a specific guard card that could be that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.360 
a specific guard card that could be that
could<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.150> strong<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.250> had

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
could be really strong just like we had

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.730 
could be really strong just like we had
an<00:02:28.490> industry<00:02:28.880> with<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> werewolves<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.900> so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
an industry with the werewolves and so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.100 
an industry with the werewolves and so
on<00:02:30.860> where<00:02:31.070> where<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.459> car<00:02:31.940> turns<00:02:32.270> through

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
on where where the car turns through

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.130 
on where where the car turns through
another<00:02:33.410> card<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> back<00:02:34.070> side<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.810> if

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
another card on the back side and so if

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.510 
another card on the back side and so if
you<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.950> could<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.190> realized

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
you think about it it could be realized

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.390 
you think about it it could be realized
that<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> creature<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:39.320> instant<00:02:39.650> would

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
that that a creature for instant would

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.060 
that that a creature for instant would
they<00:02:40.580> live<00:02:40.820> up<00:02:41.000> through<00:02:41.330> its<00:02:42.110> ultimate<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
they live up through its ultimate and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.930 
they live up through its ultimate and
then<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.120> transform<00:02:44.690> onto<00:02:45.590> this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
then and then transform onto this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.770 
then and then transform onto this
godlike<00:02:46.989> thing<00:02:47.989> since<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.190> thurs<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:50.330> all<00:02:50.510> about

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
godlike thing since a thurs is all about

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.720 
godlike thing since a thurs is all about
the<00:02:50.959> Greek<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.440> Roman<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:52.510> theme<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.560> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the Greek and Roman a theme I I think it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.760 
the Greek and Roman a theme I I think it
it<00:02:55.730> also<00:02:55.880> represents<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.570> whole<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.739> whole

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
it also represents the whole the whole

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.160 
it also represents the whole the whole
let<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.940> creatures<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.900> world

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
let that that creatures in this world

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.210 
let that that creatures in this world
want<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> become<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.760> ultimate<00:03:02.360> scarred<00:03:02.900> in

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
want to become the ultimate scarred in

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.699 
want to become the ultimate scarred in
which<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.850> feel<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.989> mechanic<00:03:06.500> could

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
which I I feel like this mechanic could

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.640 
which I I feel like this mechanic could
be<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.810> also<00:03:08.810> could<00:03:09.050> be<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.350> fun<00:03:09.440> thing

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
be and also could be a really fun thing

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.330 
be and also could be a really fun thing
to<00:03:10.720> experiment<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:12.230> cool<00:03:12.980> thing<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
to experiment with a cool thing to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.150 
to experiment with a cool thing to
notice<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.900> terrace<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.830> Greek

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
notice is that the terrace in Greek

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.060 
notice is that the terrace in Greek
means<00:03:16.430> summer<00:03:17.090> which<00:03:18.019> could<00:03:18.350> lead<00:03:18.769> through

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
means summer which could lead through

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.780 
means summer which could lead through
that<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.090> could<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:21.100> mechanic<00:03:22.100> that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
that that we could have a mechanic that

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.390 
that that we could have a mechanic that
the<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.780> works<00:03:24.080> around<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.590> whole<00:03:24.799> summer

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the that works around the whole summer

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.259 
the that works around the whole summer
time<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.450> maybe<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.840> winter<00:03:27.560> time<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:28.040> wear<00:03:28.940> for

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
time and maybe a winter time to wear for

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.000 
time and maybe a winter time to wear for
instance<00:03:29.600> our<00:03:29.810> first<00:03:30.110> main<00:03:30.410> phase<00:03:30.440> would<00:03:30.860> be

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
instance our first main phase would be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.770 
instance our first main phase would be
summertime<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.820> our<00:03:31.970> second<00:03:32.630> main<00:03:32.750> phase

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
summertime and our second main phase

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.110 
summertime and our second main phase
would<00:03:33.110> be<00:03:33.260> winter<00:03:33.560> time<00:03:33.739> where<00:03:34.580> some

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
would be winter time where some

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.170 
would be winter time where some
creatures<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.840> other<00:03:35.989> cats<00:03:36.320> would<00:03:36.590> have

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
creatures and other cats would have

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.030 
creatures and other cats would have
synergized<00:03:38.180> through<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.690> summer<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.200> winter

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
synergized through the summer and winter

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.330 
synergized through the summer and winter
theme<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.410> again<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.709> just<00:03:42.950> purely

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
theme and again this is just purely

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.789 
theme and again this is just purely
speculation<00:03:43.970> but<00:03:44.420> they<00:03:44.600> could<00:03:45.140> be<00:03:45.170> actually

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
speculation but they could be actually

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.960 
speculation but they could be actually
be<00:03:45.950> real<00:03:46.220> nice<00:03:46.370> for<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.790> day<00:03:47.360> nights<00:03:47.890> mechanic

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
be real nice for the day nights mechanic

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.990 
be real nice for the day nights mechanic
although<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.150> did<00:03:50.329> have<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:52.610> in

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
although we did have this in in in in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.720 
although we did have this in in in in
straight<00:03:53.360> but<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:54.709> again<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.070> could<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.250> could

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
straight but but again it could be could

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.930 
straight but but again it could be could
be<00:03:55.790> fun<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.239> have<00:03:56.989> something<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.620> this

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
be fun to have something like this

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.310 
be fun to have something like this
another<00:03:58.940> cool<00:03:59.180> mechanic<00:03:59.480> for<00:03:59.810> theros<00:04:00.140> would

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
another cool mechanic for theros would

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.740 
another cool mechanic for theros would
be<00:04:00.470> working<00:04:01.010> around<00:04:01.070> having<00:04:01.850> equipments<00:04:02.510> be<00:04:02.720> a

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
be working around having equipments be a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.920 
be working around having equipments be a
big<00:04:03.380> deal<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.950> their<00:04:04.160> set<00:04:04.400> with<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.360> building

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
big deal of their set with the building

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.009 
big deal of their set with the building
your<00:04:06.530> hero<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:07.190> be<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.730> ultimate<00:04:07.820> card<00:04:08.329> for

turned<00:04:21.690> into<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.260> card<00:04:22.500> just<00:04:22.980> like<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.370> level

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
turned into a card just like the level

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.210 
turned into a card just like the level
of<00:04:24.330> mechanical<00:04:24.930> talked<00:04:25.410> about<00:04:25.650> before<00:04:25.830> that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
of mechanical talked about before that

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.880 
of mechanical talked about before that
could<00:04:27.180> actually<00:04:27.300> be<00:04:27.480> really<00:04:27.810> cool<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.320> again

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
could actually be really cool and again

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.170 
could actually be really cool and again
something<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.310> would<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.700> really<00:04:29.910> fun

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
something that would be really fun

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.950 
something that would be really fun
instead<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.260> creature<00:04:31.980> heavy<00:04:32.250> tech

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
instead of have creature heavy tech

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.570 
instead of have creature heavy tech
mechanic<00:04:33.960> wise<00:04:34.140> for<00:04:34.500> theros<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.220> was<00:04:35.340> also

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
mechanic wise for theros it was also

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.310 
mechanic wise for theros it was also
announced<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:36.120> they<00:04:36.360> have<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.810> returning

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
announced that they have a returning

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.100 
announced that they have a returning
mechanic<00:04:37.770> what<00:04:37.950> they<00:04:38.160> would<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.330> would<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.750> in

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
mechanic what they would be would be in

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.890 
mechanic what they would be would be in
Paris<00:04:40.680> which<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.820> course<00:04:41.850> really<00:04:42.390> nice<00:04:42.540> for

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
Paris which is of course really nice for

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.710 
Paris which is of course really nice for
for<00:04:43.860> people<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.280> want<00:04:44.310> this<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:45.540> only

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
for people that want this the only

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.240 
for people that want this the only
problem<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.050> see<00:04:46.080> with<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
problem I see with this is that the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.690 
problem I see with this is that the
return<00:04:48.060> mechanic<00:04:48.570> for<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.920> fun<00:04:49.920> expensing<00:04:50.490> can

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
return mechanic for a fun expensing can

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.610 
return mechanic for a fun expensing can
be<00:04:50.880> something<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.510> doesn't<00:04:51.900> really<00:04:52.020> fit<00:04:52.290> the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
be something that doesn't really fit the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.390 
be something that doesn't really fit the
whole<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.300> whole<00:04:54.330> block<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.130> can<00:04:56.130> really

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
whole the whole block and can really

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360 
whole the whole block and can really
ruin<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.240> blog<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.840> there<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:59.130> not

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
ruin the blog and there and and not

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.510 
ruin the blog and there and and not
really<00:04:59.550> do<00:05:00.330> much<00:05:00.510> other<00:05:00.840> than<00:05:01.050> then<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.340> nut

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
really do much other than then the nut

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.700 
really do much other than then the nut
shine<00:05:02.820> through<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.780> new<00:05:04.140> mechanics<00:05:04.590> are

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
shine through that the new mechanics are

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.820 
shine through that the new mechanics are
going<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:05.010> be<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.970> I'm<00:05:06.900> looking<00:05:07.410> forward<00:05:07.680> to

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
going to be so I'm looking forward to

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.340 
going to be so I'm looking forward to

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
see what the return a mechanical it is

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.800 
see what the return a mechanical it is
and<00:05:11.310> I'm<00:05:11.400> really<00:05:11.580> hoping<00:05:11.760> it's<00:05:12.090> it's<00:05:12.330> one<00:05:12.570> of

and I'm really hoping it's it's one of
course<00:05:13.260> it's<00:05:13.470> one<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.770> one<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.490> them<00:05:14.760> I<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:14.940> like
