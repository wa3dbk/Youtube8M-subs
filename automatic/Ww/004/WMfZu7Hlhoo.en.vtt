00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.080
 So now he is only 85 it is high time for a new nuclear power plant I 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.359
 thought that's about time to go until they die and time out 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.860
 Zurich now has to be especially handy to have open systems 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.900
 Strangulating Hartmann or broadcasting our lives to TV stations 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:18.470
 broadcast 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.730
 renounce 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.140
 but the EM can be remedied by two handy physicians i 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.390
 great as well 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.789
 I wish you much fun, Folger said and see you later 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.070
 so how come then to do 2 1 start with the performance calls can be free 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 be downloaded and is one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.940
 m also operations from TV the Talend sit 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 the offense in most cases violations to that already existed on the PC 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.140
 Watching TV 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 Now also available at SAP for both iPhone and iPad 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.059
 Hombeck has to say that the private channels like Spanish sat1 pro7 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.070
 or box is not available I suspect there 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.730
 there are legal problems 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.170
 that was not supported at all but if it is a nice one 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.520
 Sender selection available Service many public law like WDR NDR 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.060
 but also a few i find that one does not know the industry so very bull 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.990
 civil engineering 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.360
 But Gruner others is van der Meet the Marks the fourth 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.710
 artec IT AG for welding &amp; cutting francs 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.920
 Sort speculators and yourself 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 change in order by simply pulling 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.280
 nobody can get more memory BaFin before 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 closer information and know 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.080
 21 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.770
 it was too 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 develop but we want to complete 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.830
 The goal is a little over a month, 50 euros and so on 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.010
 The advantage of this is that no advertising 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.940
 OMV in front of the individual stations comes at the station change 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.620
 So there is advertising simplifying here with the Nordi like 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.250
 missing is this really live view which is really very nice 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 Indexes Market Landscape Cheese Start 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.740
 that usually shows a small clip thus 30 seconds 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.339
 so the television is financed, one has no arguments 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.749
 But once again, in Formula One, it's not too often 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:18.669
 changing 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:22.099
 the whole thing works both overwhelmed and w-lan means one 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.239
 can also go 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.500
 What you look for, for example, is the women's quota lifetime Essener 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.639
 interested in looking 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.059
 So far, rar is similar here as well 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.669
 Knowing exactly when wants to have quality has continued to improve 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.709
 we can all that is also a nice option here in the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.829
 full screen 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.399
 and 5 Walton 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.039
 then i can do it all over 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.669
 No Apple for the ads can be so nice it can be so many 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.489
 to let 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.840
 it is very nice options it gives the quality it is not the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.909
 best but i find 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.659
 healthy and in the end it was easy 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.259
 for example you too 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.639
 in pieces 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.149
 Stender inside 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.849
 like the 1st 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.969
 Nicole also sees a brief touch as in the beginning 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.489
 Kristina not even this time 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.239
 But then it's been the mixed ladies 50 euros but nothing went wrong 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.780
 are because the Ludolfs 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.370
 Winner because the quality on the way is very pleasant was safe 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.479
 no HD 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.659
 but that the whole cost is finally on the way out yet 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:27.659
 favorite countries 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.029
 Invensys haunt the harbor franc transmitter runs 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.499
 really really fast flies in the summer warm on the beach lays 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.109
 or a few cracks 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.189
 to watch his favorite show news which scenes 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.919
 it's all for radio and lovers 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.489
 I always had to look at APA myself 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.959
 Tie Radio de Med is the best app of all 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.819
 An is also free so you can not go wrong 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.619
 I think it's here in the state take a nice overview 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.949
 sorted by different categories the individual stations sorted 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.659
 Action «Top 100» 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.659
 Everything is possible 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.939
 Bender at Chance by music style, it can also be individual stations 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.669
 other countries 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.299
 a simpler way to find disposers is simply the one you're looking for 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.629
 variant 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.389
 The carnival clubs can be safe 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.199
 just go through the radio 7 o'clock 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.669
 m and then go to «Search» 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.630
 and after a short time we should then be displayed on the radio 7 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:36.419
 Here at the top is already in Sanaa, every guy is just bitter 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.270
 on 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.060
 and the radio show is praiseworthy that the whole thing is so easy 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.620
 Quality printing I also fine here, too, we have the opportunity 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.759
 The whole thing is to make Apple feel like reading and then hear it here too 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.830
 we can pause all year and 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.099
 keep playing the whole thing 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.939
 attacks on the memory of the iPhone should reason something stores back us 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.469
 get info where the whole thing is broadcast and what the 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.749
 main music styles is this station 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.020
 in silver 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.069
 this button 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.770
 right sample booklet 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.069
 get more information and I will see similar scene 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.300
 Under my radio I can if I have asked myself the single parking space 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.069
 completely free and easy to log in easily 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.389
 yes an e-mail notified that was it 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.990
 so they come in to be favorites 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.990
 this works for how to easily set sentence 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.409
 for this a retiree has to be from Radio 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.029
 and amplified individually singers jump 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.109
 Of course, the t-shirt is also nice when it leaves 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.139
 So can do other things Alastair can do 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.400
 in Cologne frontman would have belonged to the crisis yesterday 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.990
 It's really good too 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.520
 You can also always happy new ones 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.430
 in Favorites no recommendations Ads leave my favorite 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.740
 correspond and fanbase last belonged 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.030
 Watch the scene 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.150
 Under Infos I get a few details z 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.889
 Feedback and finally is not so fast eating all the big three 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.649
 Transmitter 4 but also just a lot of little unknowns occur on it 

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.459
 Special music genres you have not specialized on the radio 

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.459
 So there is something for everyone 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.789
 for not really nice way to hear about Ali on the way 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.620
 and I think with these two apses you are well prepared for the summer 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.520
 Year and now the time is still like today 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.340
 she is just as practical as me and the world have spoken that's the way it is 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.099
 at the free can do online storage and 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.210
 Initially, not really taking a seat opportunity 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.810
 so also his favorite show 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.099
 and his favorite club is to abstain 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.629
 In addition, this also has something extended only that this fight is 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.300
 and led quickly perform again one night of the 9th 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.800
 If they have something to solve themselves, that does not deliver big and if that 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.229
 only 25 people join in the whole thing is going on 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.499
 Seam yarn meaningfully close 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.599
 Mark van Bommel is free and delivers something 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.849
 but approve a great program 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.810
 so this is we want the chance we enjoy and of course want me 

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:28.199
 We too next time
