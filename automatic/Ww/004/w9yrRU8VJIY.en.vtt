00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
think I think you probably assume that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.990 
think I think you probably assume that
pretty<00:01:29.900> much<00:01:29.990> everybody<00:01:30.380> always<00:01:30.770> has

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
look at it and be like whatever but this

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
look at it and be like whatever but this
particular<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.850> don't<00:03:13.150> normally<00:03:13.330> is<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.690> an

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
particular I don't normally is in an

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.600 
particular I don't normally is in an
all-black<00:03:14.230> case<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> fact<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.490> got

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
all-black case so the fact that it's got

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.370 
all-black case so the fact that it's got
the<00:03:15.760> red<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:15.940> black<00:03:16.210> is<00:03:16.510> definitely<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:17.350> know

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the red and black is definitely you know

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.470 
the red and black is definitely you know
a<00:03:17.680> way<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:18.010> doing<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.610> kind<00:03:19.360> of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
a way of doing a little kind of

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.420 
a way of doing a little kind of
collaboration<00:03:20.200> there<00:03:20.350> between<00:03:20.950> everything

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
collaboration there between everything

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.170 
collaboration there between everything
you<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.330> twist<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> top<00:03:23.050> here<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:24.310> then

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
you just twist the top here and then

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.720 
you just twist the top here and then
you've<00:03:25.330> got<00:03:25.480> eyedrops<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.290> kind<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.280> cool

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
you've got eyedrops so kind of cool

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.160 
you've got eyedrops so kind of cool
I<00:03:27.760> think<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> eye<00:03:28.180> drops<00:03:28.450> are<00:03:28.630> always<00:03:28.870> really

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
I think the eye drops are always really

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.020 
I think the eye drops are always really
neat<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.530> pretty<00:03:29.830> even<00:03:30.580> just<00:03:30.730> regular<00:03:31.000> old

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
neat and pretty even just regular old

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.930 
neat and pretty even just regular old
eye<00:03:31.240> drops<00:03:31.480> look<00:03:31.630> kind<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.840> cool<00:03:31.990> like<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.350> so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
eye drops look kind of cool like this so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.460 
eye drops look kind of cool like this so
you<00:03:33.940> know<00:03:34.000> maybe<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:34.990> something<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.380> were

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.630 
you know maybe not something you were
thinking<00:03:35.770> of<00:03:35.890> if<00:03:36.070> you're<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.490> coming
