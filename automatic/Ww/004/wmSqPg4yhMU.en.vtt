00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:06.510
 Good, so it's the second day on safari and we're heading back to the Kruger National Park. The 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.450
 Today's focus will be to find animals like around the water. So we go 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.830
 should visit a waterhole maybe see some buffalo, some hippos and we will see what 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.320
 otherwise we can find. So again, it's an early start. It's about thirty-five in the morning 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.520
 and we're going to head out there. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.300
 So far, as good as the weather today. It looks like we're going to have a lot better 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.480
 visibility. We have an incredible sunrise to testify this morning. But it's cold and so we are 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.010
 already bundled. It's a lot colder than it was yesterday but the sun is coming out. us 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 yesterday has a bit of drip, so it will be warmer. Just wait for it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.000
 get warmer. And I think we're going to have even better visibility for photos and video 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.149
 in terms of taking pictures of the animals. So, exciting things! 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:51.649
 Good 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.149
 a pretty cool morning so far. We managed to seat the ever-elusive leopard. So it was 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.299
 pretty cool. And we also saw an elephant's audience just crossing the road. There was 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:49.609
 About fifteen or twenty of them, so it was also a pretty impressive sight. 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:03:08.840
 One of the coolest things I've seen today was on a waterhole. There was a crocodile 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.730
 and it's waiting for an impala to drink. And it was so close to the attack it is. like 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.530
 We almost have this ridiculous crazy scene. 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.049
 Anyway, the crocodile was unsuccessful and it ended up attacking another crocodile. and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:44.260
 we caught some of those footage. 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:09.279
 A safari point to consider is to dress with all kinds of layers. This morning it was freezing. 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.879
 I was wearing a fleece, I peeled off on a windbreaker and now afternoon 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.669
 just wear this little kind of athletic shirt. And you're wearing thick trunks. Yes, 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:05:13.449
 so i wish i had shorts now for that. 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:06:08.370
 Well, so we wrap our second day of safari. We're heading for 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.849
 the campsites soon and we are going to have our first braai for dinner and believe 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.750
 it is South African braai so it should be nice.
