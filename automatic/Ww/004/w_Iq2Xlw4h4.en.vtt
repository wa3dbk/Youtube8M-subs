this week and the end of the flow course

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.840 
this week and the end of the flow course
will<00:00:03.000> be<00:00:03.210> focusing<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.830> concept<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.400> empty

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
will be focusing on the concept of empty

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.470 
will be focusing on the concept of empty
and<00:00:05.970> full<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.799> on<00:00:07.799> movement<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> energy<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
and full and on movement of energy and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.700 
and full and on movement of energy and
our<00:00:09.750> legs<00:00:11.150> and<00:00:12.150> how<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> move<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> energy

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
our legs and how how to move the energy
in<00:00:14.009> our<00:00:14.160> legs<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.360> be

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
in our legs so that we're going to be

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.660 
in our legs so that we're going to be
able<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:16.139> balanced<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.250> all<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.580> our

movements and have a smooth flow of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
movements and have a smooth flow of
energy<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.840> our<00:00:21.960> legs<00:00:22.260> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.560> rest<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
energy up from our legs into the rest of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
energy up from our legs into the rest of
our<00:00:23.130> body<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.699> whatever<00:00:24.300> we're<00:00:24.539> doing<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:26.570> the

shoulder width apart or even a little

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.299 
shoulder width apart or even a little
wider<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.130> we're<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> rock<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> one

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
wider as we're going to rock the one

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
wider as we're going to rock the one
side<00:00:44.750> simply<00:00:45.750> transferring<00:00:46.649> weight<00:00:48.379> from<00:00:49.379> one

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
side simply transferring weight from one

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
side simply transferring weight from one
leg<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.440> imagine<00:00:56.600> our

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
leg and as we do this we can imagine our

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
leg and as we do this we can imagine our
bodies<00:00:57.930> full<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> water<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> course<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
bodies full of water which of course it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
bodies full of water which of course it
is<00:01:00.710> but<00:01:01.710> also<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.250> fluid<00:01:02.730> weight<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.359> force

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is but also that fluid weight the force

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
is but also that fluid weight the force
and<00:01:03.989> weight<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> water<00:01:04.880> that<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.939> transfer

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and weight of the water that we transfer

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660 
and weight of the water that we transfer
it<00:01:06.750> from<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.229> leg<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.549> if

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it from one leg to the other much as if

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
it from one leg to the other much as if
you<00:01:08.700> had<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.119> cups<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.200> fill<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you had two cups and you fill one up and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.780 
you had two cups and you fill one up and
impede<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> other<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.170> tip<00:01:13.790> from

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
impede the other and then you tip from

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
impede the other and then you tip from
one<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:16.140> filling<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.280> from

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
one back into the other filling out from

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.539 
one back into the other filling out from
one<00:01:17.700> side<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.200> other<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.130> becomes

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
one side to the other so one becomes

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.010 
one side to the other so one becomes
full<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.140> other<00:01:22.290> empty<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
full and the other empty so I want this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.969 
full and the other empty so I want this

leg we're now going to transfer our

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
leg we're now going to transfer our
weight<00:03:01.540> forwards<00:03:03.060> onto<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.480> front<00:03:04.780> leg

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
weight forwards onto the front leg

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.670 
weight forwards onto the front leg
filling<00:03:06.670> up<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> front<00:03:07.180> leg<00:03:07.390> being<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.500> back

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
filling up the front leg being the back

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:25.200 
filling up the front leg being the back
leg<00:03:10.620> onto<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.860> back<00:03:21.450> leg<00:03:23.850> filling<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.970> front

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
leg onto the back leg filling the front

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.850 
leg onto the back leg filling the front
they<00:03:25.360> got<00:03:25.570> keeping<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> back<00:03:26.410> leg<00:03:26.650> out

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
they got keeping the back leg out

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:43.150 
they got keeping the back leg out
keeping<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.460> body<00:03:27.720> centered<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.870> balanced

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.970 

so<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.340> next<00:03:44.550> step<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.420> take<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.500> concept

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
so the next step is to take this concept

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.280 
so the next step is to take this concept
of<00:03:47.190> emptying<00:03:47.820> Hall<00:03:48.120> even<00:03:48.390> further<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.020> see

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
of emptying Hall even further and see

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.230 
of emptying Hall even further and see
how<00:03:49.560> well<00:03:49.830> we're<00:03:50.160> emptying<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.760> filling<00:03:50.820> our

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
how well we're emptying and filling our

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.330 
how well we're emptying and filling our
legs<00:03:51.560> as<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.830> turn<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.610> one<00:03:54.420> side<00:03:54.840> our<00:03:55.710> back<00:03:56.070> leg

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
legs as we turn to one side our back leg

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.220 
legs as we turn to one side our back leg
should<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.730> full<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.360> our<00:03:57.420> front<00:03:57.660> leg<00:03:57.840> empty

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
should be full and our front leg empty

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.620 
should be full and our front leg empty
so<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.070> should<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.490> able<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.880> lift<00:04:00.120> our<00:04:00.330> front

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
so we should be able to lift our front

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.540 
so we should be able to lift our front
leg<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.910> then<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:03.960> rock<00:04:04.170> forwards<00:04:04.770> our

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
leg and then as we rock forwards our

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.160 
leg and then as we rock forwards our
front<00:04:05.880> leg<00:04:06.060> should<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.390> full<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.870> our<00:04:06.990> back

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
front leg should be full and our back

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.220 
front leg should be full and our back
leg<00:04:07.380> in<00:04:07.620> D<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.520> should<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.910> able<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.270> lift

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
leg in D so you should be able to lift

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.220 
leg in D so you should be able to lift
our<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.890> leg<00:04:11.130> couldn't<00:04:11.970> be<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.210> wait<00:04:14.210> and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
our back leg couldn't be of wait and

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.160 
our back leg couldn't be of wait and
what's<00:04:16.230> more<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:16.830> do<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:17.730> we've<00:04:18.660> truly

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
what's more as we do this if we've truly

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.320 
what's more as we do this if we've truly
transferred<00:04:19.950> our<00:04:20.100> weight<00:04:20.310> evenly<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
transferred our weight evenly in a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.110 
transferred our weight evenly in a
centered<00:04:21.750> balanced<00:04:22.110> way<00:04:22.730> we'll<00:04:23.730> be<00:04:23.910> able<00:04:24.000> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
centered balanced way we'll be able to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.090 
centered balanced way we'll be able to
do<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.330> without<00:04:24.390> rocking<00:04:25.170> or<00:04:25.380> stiffening<00:04:25.920> our

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
do it without rocking or stiffening our

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.750 
do it without rocking or stiffening our
body<00:04:26.340> will<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.180> very<00:04:27.480> gentle<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.320> easy<00:04:28.760> we

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
body will be very gentle and easy we

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.580 
body will be very gentle and easy we
want<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.210> now<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.660> begin<00:04:30.990> with<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.290> may<00:04:31.530> be

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
want to now to begin with this may be

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.150 
want to now to begin with this may be
challenging<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:33.150> may<00:04:33.330> find<00:04:33.630> yourself

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
challenging and you may find yourself

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.910 
challenging and you may find yourself
rocking<00:04:35.450> tensing<00:04:36.450> up<00:04:36.630> but<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.590> aim<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.890> to

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
rocking tensing up but the aim is to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.690 
rocking tensing up but the aim is to
stay<00:04:38.340> relaxed<00:04:39.090> as<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.420> lift<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.580> it

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
stay relaxed as you lift and do it

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.270 
stay relaxed as you lift and do it
without<00:04:42.020> leaning<00:04:43.020> backwards<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.650> forth<00:04:43.920> to

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
without leaning backwards and forth to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.160 
without leaning backwards and forth to
stay<00:04:44.460> nice<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.000> balanced<00:04:45.740> lift<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:48.870> you

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
stay nice and balanced lift so that you

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.460 
stay nice and balanced lift so that you
can<00:04:49.410> fully<00:04:49.800> empty<00:04:50.520> out<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.320> fill<00:04:52.320> up<00:04:52.500> each<00:04:53.210> leg

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
can fully empty out and fill up each leg

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.230 
can fully empty out and fill up each leg
while<00:04:55.470> remaining<00:04:55.890> nice<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.610> balanced<00:04:57.090> and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
while remaining nice and balanced and

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.480 
while remaining nice and balanced and
centered

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.129 

so<00:05:03.490> spent<00:05:03.849> some<00:05:04.030> time<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:04.449> one<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.990> one

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
so spent some time on that one that one

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.540 
so spent some time on that one that one
may<00:05:05.319> be<00:05:05.379> quite<00:05:05.710> challenging<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:08.169> last<00:05:08.550> stage

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
may be quite challenging the last stage

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.779 
may be quite challenging the last stage
in<00:05:09.819> this<00:05:10.000> is<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.289> actually<00:05:11.500> do<00:05:11.949> some<00:05:12.280> centered

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
in this is to actually do some centered

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.209 
in this is to actually do some centered
balance<00:05:13.210> stepping<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.469> actually<00:05:14.740> walk<00:05:14.979> in

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
balance stepping to actually walk in

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.420 
balance stepping to actually walk in
this<00:05:15.370> way<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> lot<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.259> us<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:18.129> we<00:05:18.250> walk

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
this way for a lot of us when we walk

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.309 
this way for a lot of us when we walk
we're<00:05:18.729> actually<00:05:19.270> committing<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.080> step

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
we're actually committing to the step

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.649 
we're actually committing to the step
and<00:05:20.620> we<00:05:21.099> essentially<00:05:21.490> actually<00:05:21.849> fall<00:05:22.240> into

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
and we essentially actually fall into

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.490 
and we essentially actually fall into
each<00:05:23.020> step<00:05:23.939> and<00:05:24.939> we're<00:05:25.569> quite<00:05:25.840> unaware<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.409> it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
each step and we're quite unaware of it

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.709 
each step and we're quite unaware of it
if<00:05:26.620> we're<00:05:26.800> walking<00:05:27.219> quite<00:05:27.669> quickly<00:05:27.909> what<00:05:28.689> we

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
if we're walking quite quickly what we

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.350 
if we're walking quite quickly what we
want<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.139> do<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.469> be<00:05:29.530> able<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.889> stay

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
want to do is to be able to stay

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.719 
want to do is to be able to stay
balanced<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.449> centered<00:05:31.979> through<00:05:32.979> every<00:05:33.400> step

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
balanced and centered through every step

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.999

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
team saying if we've been able to fully

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.740 
team saying if we've been able to fully
empty<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:39.550> fill<00:05:39.789> our<00:05:39.939> legs<00:05:40.180> this<00:05:40.449> should<00:05:40.629> be

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
empty and fill our legs this should be

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.879 
empty and fill our legs this should be
quite<00:05:40.960> easy<00:05:41.310> then<00:05:42.310> we<00:05:42.460> can<00:05:42.610> lift<00:05:42.789> one<00:05:43.029> leg

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
quite easy then we can lift one leg
