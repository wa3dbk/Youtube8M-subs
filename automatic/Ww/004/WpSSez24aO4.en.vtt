okay<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.450> here<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.989> called<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.740> honeycomb

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay this here is called the honeycomb

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay this here is called the honeycomb
stitch<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.270> honeycomb<00:00:03.510> stitch<00:00:04.279> causes

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
stitch and the honeycomb stitch causes

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.760 
stitch and the honeycomb stitch causes
the<00:00:05.549> actual<00:00:06.120> material<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.899> really<00:00:07.500> large

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the actual material to have really large

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.160 
the actual material to have really large
waves<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> material<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:09.780> you'll<00:00:09.929> have

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
waves in the material so you'll have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830 
waves in the material so you'll have
them<00:00:10.320> beautiful<00:00:11.219> up<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.820> waves<00:00:12.179> with

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
them beautiful up and down waves with

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
them beautiful up and down waves with
this<00:00:12.990> particular<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.679> again<00:00:14.160> we're<00:00:14.429> gonna

straggler here at the end because we're

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.060 
straggler here at the end because we're
going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.330> weaving<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.020> later<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
take the back over the forward and then

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519 
take the back over the forward and then
now<00:00:25.859> grab<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.910> push<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.900> you

now grab this one and push up and you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
now grab this one and push up and you
have<00:00:28.680> your<00:00:28.710> perfect<00:00:29.099> slip<00:00:29.490> knot<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> start

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have your perfect slip knot to start

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
have your perfect slip knot to start
your<00:00:30.269> project<00:00:30.750> again<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:31.740> I'm

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
your project again if you're I'm

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.200 
your project again if you're I'm
right-handed<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> put<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> on

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
right-handed so I'm going to put it on

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.180 
right-handed so I'm going to put it on
the<00:00:33.300> top<00:00:33.510> right<00:00:34.290> hand<00:00:34.710> side<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.460> pull<00:00:36.110> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the top right hand side and pull and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.319 
the top right hand side and pull and
what<00:00:38.190> we're<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.579> doing<00:00:38.910> instead<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
what we're going to be doing instead of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
what we're going to be doing instead of
before<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> criss<00:00:40.710> crossing<00:00:41.010> action

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
before we did a criss crossing action

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.920 
before we did a criss crossing action
we're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> doing<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.750> we're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we're going to be doing it but we're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.330 
we're going to be doing it but we're
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> slightly<00:00:43.950> different

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going to be doing it slightly different

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.270 
going to be doing it slightly different
so<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.090> gonna<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.390> directly<00:00:45.780> across<00:00:46.280> okay

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so we're gonna go directly across okay

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.180 
so we're gonna go directly across okay
and<00:00:47.489> underneath<00:00:48.050> plucking<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.170> over<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> then

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and underneath plucking up over and then

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.350 
and underneath plucking up over and then
we're<00:00:50.280> gonna<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.579> down<00:00:50.610> one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we're gonna go down one

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959 
we're gonna go down one
okay<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:52.739> wrap<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.850> gonna

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
okay so then wrap and then we're gonna

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.500 
okay so then wrap and then we're gonna
go<00:00:54.180> across<00:00:54.440> but<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.860> across<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.940> do

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
go across but when we go across don't do

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.290 
go across but when we go across don't do
that<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.100> happens<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.879> need<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that because what happens is you need it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
that because what happens is you need it
to<00:01:00.480> criss<00:01:00.960> cross<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> pegs<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.059> what

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to criss cross here at the pegs so what

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.399 
to criss cross here at the pegs so what
you<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.080> back

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you have to do is when you come back

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.030 
you have to do is when you come back
across<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.610> come<00:01:05.820> under<00:01:06.409> okay<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
across you come under okay and now we

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.690 
across you come under okay and now we
jump<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> next<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.700> then

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
jump down to the next one down and then

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.929 
jump down to the next one down and then
wrap<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> again<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.400> can't<00:01:14.610> go

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
wrap so again just like so we can't go

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.330 
wrap so again just like so we can't go
down<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.920> across

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
down like that we have to go down across

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
down like that we have to go down across
go<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.420> under<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:19.460> go<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:21.350> okay

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
go down and under over go down one okay

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
go down and under over go down one okay
and<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.680> we're<00:01:22.799> gonna<00:01:22.890> jump<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> why<00:01:26.970> does

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and now we're gonna jump so why does

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.280 
and now we're gonna jump so why does
this<00:01:27.420> particular<00:01:28.080> stitch<00:01:28.850> create<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> waves

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
this particular stitch create the waves

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
this particular stitch create the waves
because<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> simple<00:01:31.860> fact<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because the simple fact is is that you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
because the simple fact is is that you
don't<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.060> anything<00:01:33.270> joining<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> between

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
don't have anything joining in between

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.749 
don't have anything joining in between
so<00:01:34.560> you're<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.729> can

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
so you're gonna have this you can

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060 
so you're gonna have this you can
actually<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> zigzag<00:01:36.930> formation<00:01:37.710> right

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
actually see the zigzag formation right

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.539 
actually see the zigzag formation right
nail<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> cause<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.549> so

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
nail that it's going to cause and so

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
nail that it's going to cause and so
then<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.570> don't<00:01:42.750> link<00:01:42.960> together

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
then that so they don't link together

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.969 
then that so they don't link together
that<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.360> what<00:01:45.360> happens<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> for

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that way and what happens is is that for

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.230 
that way and what happens is is that for
this<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> front

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
this one you're going to see the front

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
this one you're going to see the front
side<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> stitches<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
side of the stitches which is the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
side of the stitches which is the
beautiful<00:01:50.310> Ridge<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.259> there's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
beautiful Ridge but then because there's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
beautiful Ridge but then because there's
a<00:01:52.560> gap<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.250> pulls<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> expands<00:01:54.540> on

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
a gap when this pulls out and expands on

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
a gap when this pulls out and expands on
your<00:01:54.810> table<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.530> wherever<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.189> doing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
your table or wherever you're doing

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
your table or wherever you're doing
you're<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> backside<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you're going to see the backside of the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
you're going to see the backside of the
stitch<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.640> groove<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
stitch which is the the groove in the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
stitch which is the the groove in the
middle<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> cause<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> group

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
middle and it's going to cause the group

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.539 
middle and it's going to cause the group
to<00:02:02.250> expand<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.030> show<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.020> wave<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> we've

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
to expand and show a wave so we've

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.520 
to expand and show a wave so we've
decided<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.270> deciding<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> enough

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
decided I'm deciding that this is enough

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.779 
decided I'm deciding that this is enough
so<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.640> just

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so if you want to go more you just

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.150 
so if you want to go more you just
follow<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.179> constraint<00:02:09.899> configuration

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
follow this constraint configuration

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.720 
follow this constraint configuration
and<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.910> before<00:02:12.270> when<00:02:12.990> we<00:02:13.080> come<00:02:13.260> across

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

I'm a trained professional okay so what
we<00:02:34.590> need<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.460> need<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
we did before so we have to come across

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.520 
we did before so we have to come across
straight<00:02:38.820> across<00:02:40.160> okay<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.370> then<00:02:42.270> over<00:02:42.780> under

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
straight across okay and then over under

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.110 
straight across okay and then over under
and<00:02:43.740> what<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.610> do<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.850> we<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
and what we have to do is we have to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
and what we have to do is we have to
jump<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.720> one<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:47.010> jump

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
jump to this one here but when we jump

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
jump to this one here but when we jump
don't<00:02:47.910> jump<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.570> because<00:02:48.930> there's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
don't jump like this because there's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.590 
don't jump like this because there's
your<00:02:49.590> next<00:02:49.830> peg<00:02:50.070> over<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
your next peg over here you have to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.560 
your next peg over here you have to
create<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.740> twist<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.480> go

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
create that that twist so you have to go

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.280 
create that that twist so you have to go
over<00:02:54.930> under<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.030> once<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.840> edge

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
over under so now once we get that edge

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.220 
over under so now once we get that edge
done<00:02:59.190> okay<00:02:59.820> we'll<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.720> follow<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
done okay we'll just have to follow the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.100 
done okay we'll just have to follow the
same<00:03:01.410> configuration<00:03:02.100> that's<00:03:02.280> already<00:03:02.550> there

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
same configuration that's already there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.100 
same configuration that's already there
okay<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:06.240> we<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> follow

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
okay so so we just have to follow

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.910 
okay so so we just have to follow
exactly<00:03:07.680> where<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.130> string<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:12.920> it's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
exactly where that string is going it's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.940 
exactly where that string is going it's
just<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.550> edge<00:03:15.450> pieces<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.740> we're<00:03:16.860> gonna

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
just on the edge pieces so we're gonna

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.630 
just on the edge pieces so we're gonna
pull<00:03:17.250> over<00:03:17.600> okay<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:19.950> can<00:03:20.430> still

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
pull over okay so there you can still

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.220 
pull over okay so there you can still
see<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.940> gap<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.390> don't<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.990> Criss

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
see the gap so you don't have the Criss

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.190 
see the gap so you don't have the Criss
crossing<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.130> see<00:03:23.520> before<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.750> we

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
crossing like you just see before so we

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.600 
crossing like you just see before so we
finished<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.770> peg<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.220> what<00:03:26.370> we're<00:03:26.490> going

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
finished on this peg so what we're going

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
finished on this peg so what we're going
to<00:03:26.640> do<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.150> grab<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> bottom<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.200> pull

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
to do is just grab the bottom and pull

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.430 
to do is just grab the bottom and pull
it<00:03:28.680> over<00:03:29.480> okay<00:03:30.480> now<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:30.870> let<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.140> go<00:03:31.290> it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
it over okay now we can let it go it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.130 
it over okay now we can let it go it
won't<00:03:31.620> fall<00:03:31.860> off<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.570> gonna<00:03:33.750> work<00:03:33.930> my<00:03:34.110> way

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
won't fall off and I'm gonna work my way

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.970 
won't fall off and I'm gonna work my way
down<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.650> peg<00:03:34.860> pegs<00:03:35.850> on<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.630> side<00:03:36.980> because

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
down the peg pegs on this side because

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.610 
down the peg pegs on this side because
that's<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.340> finished<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.060> side

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.580 

okay<00:03:46.620> now<00:03:47.250> I'm<00:03:47.340> going<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.550> flip<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.910> over<00:03:48.590> and

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
okay now I'm going to flip it over and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.440 
okay now I'm going to flip it over and
take<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.070> bottom<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.520> again<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.240> same

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
take the bottom and again the same

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.300 
take the bottom and again the same
concept<00:03:51.990> like<00:03:52.170> before<00:03:52.500> because<00:03:52.980> you've

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
concept like before because you've

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.860 
concept like before because you've
already<00:03:53.460> pulled<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.910> side<00:03:54.150> off<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.600> makes

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
already pulled this side off it makes

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.220 
already pulled this side off it makes
this<00:03:55.050> side<00:03:55.260> loosey-goosey<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:57.240> that<00:03:58.050> is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
this side loosey-goosey and that is

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.350 
this side loosey-goosey and that is
natural<00:03:58.710> that's<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.250> concept<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.940> loom

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
natural that's just the concept of loom

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.330 
natural that's just the concept of loom
knitting<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.870> don't<00:04:01.140> worry<00:04:01.320> about<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.950> if

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
knitting so don't worry about it and if

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.220 
knitting so don't worry about it and if
anything<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.630> side<00:04:03.870> when<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.140> go

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
anything you get this side when you go

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.040 
anything you get this side when you go
across<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:04.980> easy<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.580> fast<00:04:05.810> because<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.930> is

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
across is so easy and fast because it is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.680 
across is so easy and fast because it is
loose<00:04:10.580> okay<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:11.940> what<00:04:12.060> we're<00:04:12.180> gonna<00:04:12.270> do<00:04:12.510> we've

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
loose okay so what we're gonna do we've

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.570 
loose okay so what we're gonna do we've
finished<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.830> see<00:04:14.010> there's<00:04:14.220> only<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.550> a

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
finished you can see there's only one a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.370 
finished you can see there's only one a
beach<00:04:14.910> alright<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.960> we're<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.230> just

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
beach alright so we're going to just

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.320 
beach alright so we're going to just
push<00:04:16.590> down<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.519> grabbing<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:20.970> material

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
push down so grabbing your material

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.460 
push down so grabbing your material
again<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.320> then<00:04:22.550> load<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.580> again<00:04:23.820> and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
again we have to then load up again and

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.620 
again we have to then load up again and
we<00:04:25.470> are<00:04:25.560> gonna<00:04:25.650> come<00:04:25.950> over<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.390> we're<00:04:27.540> gonna

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
we are gonna come over so we're gonna

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.160 
we are gonna come over so we're gonna
come<00:04:27.900> back<00:04:28.380> across<00:04:28.910> okay<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.360> under<00:04:30.540> over

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
come back across okay so under over

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.460 
come back across okay so under over
under<00:04:31.430> over<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:33.150> now<00:04:33.780> we're<00:04:33.930> gonna<00:04:34.020> jump<00:04:34.290> to

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
under over and now we're gonna jump to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.910 
under over and now we're gonna jump to
this<00:04:34.590> one<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.610> under<00:04:36.150> over<00:04:36.810> because<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.740> had

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
this one so under over because you had

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.300 
this one so under over because you had
to<00:04:38.040> create<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:39.360> twisting<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:41.160> like

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
to create that that twisting just like

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.000 
to create that that twisting just like
so<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.570> now<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.140> follow<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.800> same

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
so so now we just follow the same

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.400 
so so now we just follow the same
configuration<00:04:44.730> that's<00:04:44.910> already<00:04:45.150> there<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:46.290> we

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
configuration that's already there so we

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.250 
configuration that's already there so we
just<00:04:46.530> come<00:04:46.740> under<00:04:47.340> over<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:47.880> then<00:04:48.480> down<00:04:48.510> under

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
just come under over and then down under

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.620 
just come under over and then down under
over<00:04:49.680> across<00:04:50.340> under<00:04:51.150> over<00:04:51.540> down<00:04:52.350> under<00:04:53.040> over

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.620 

okay<00:04:57.630> across<00:04:58.110> over<00:04:58.860> under<00:04:59.190> down<00:04:59.730> over<00:05:00.300> under

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
okay across over under down over under

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.810 
okay across over under down over under
across<00:05:01.380> over<00:05:01.710> under<00:05:03.830> okay<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.040> now<00:05:05.669> we're

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
across over under okay and now we're

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.240 
across over under okay and now we're
going<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:05.970> get<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.390> end<00:05:06.980> so<00:05:07.980> I'm<00:05:08.100> just

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
going to get to the end so I'm just

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.820 
going to get to the end so I'm just
gonna<00:05:08.340> hold<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.000> now<00:05:09.930> I'm<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.440> turning

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
gonna hold it and now I'm just turning

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.550 
gonna hold it and now I'm just turning
it<00:05:11.070> over<00:05:11.220> just<00:05:11.760> pushing<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.300> bottom<00:05:12.630> over<00:05:12.780> so

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
it over just pushing the bottom over so

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.590 
it over just pushing the bottom over so
now<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.980> let<00:05:14.100> that<00:05:14.130> go<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:15.150> know<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.390> can

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
now I can let that go you know I can

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.500 
now I can let that go you know I can
just<00:05:15.630> work<00:05:16.020> my<00:05:16.050> way<00:05:16.320> back<00:05:16.590> across<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.850> loom<00:05:18.060> so

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
just work my way back across the loom so

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.770 
just work my way back across the loom so
just<00:05:18.750> like<00:05:18.840> before<00:05:18.870> because<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.919> finished<00:05:20.160> off

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
just like before because I finished off

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.060 
just like before because I finished off
like<00:05:21.780> we're<00:05:21.930> always<00:05:22.080> going<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.410> finish<00:05:22.620> off<00:05:22.890> on

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
like we're always going to finish off on

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.400 
like we're always going to finish off on
the<00:05:23.190> same<00:05:23.370> side<00:05:23.730> so<00:05:24.510> therefore<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.050> one<00:05:25.230> this

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
the same side so therefore the one this

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.930 
the same side so therefore the one this
side<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:25.770> going<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.919> have<00:05:25.980> a<00:05:26.190> little<00:05:26.490> bit<00:05:26.700> of<00:05:26.850> a

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
side is going to have a little bit of a

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.450 
side is going to have a little bit of a
different<00:05:27.300> look<00:05:27.330> at<00:05:28.320> what<00:05:28.620> looked<00:05:29.220> a<00:05:29.310> little

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
different look at what looked a little

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.300 
different look at what looked a little
more<00:05:29.700> tense<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.840> pattern<00:05:31.590> on<00:05:31.740> top<00:05:31.770> where<00:05:32.220> the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
more tense a pattern on top where the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.560 
more tense a pattern on top where the
other<00:05:32.490> side<00:05:32.729> will<00:05:32.940> look<00:05:32.970> kind<00:05:33.479> of

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
other side will look kind of

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.900 
other side will look kind of
loosey-goosey<00:05:33.870> but<00:05:34.229> very<00:05:34.590> blending<00:05:35.070> so<00:05:35.310> it

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
loosey-goosey but very blending so it

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.530 
loosey-goosey but very blending so it
you<00:05:36.510> just<00:05:36.750> create<00:05:37.169> two<00:05:37.380> different<00:05:37.680> looks<00:05:37.979> on

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
you just create two different looks on

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.450 
you just create two different looks on
depending<00:05:39.540> on<00:05:39.630> what<00:05:39.750> side<00:05:39.990> it<00:05:40.169> goes<00:05:40.460> so

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
depending on what side it goes so

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.159 
depending on what side it goes so
because<00:05:41.760> this<00:05:41.910> is<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> little<00:05:42.570> complex<00:05:42.930> I'm

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
because this is a little complex I'm

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.650 
because this is a little complex I'm
going<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.380> go<00:05:43.470> one<00:05:43.620> more<00:05:43.770> round<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:45.030> we're<00:05:45.479> now

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
going to go one more round so we're now

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.390 
going to go one more round so we're now
finished<00:05:46.340> okay<00:05:47.720> so<00:05:48.720> I'm<00:05:48.780> pushing<00:05:49.020> down<00:05:49.400> and

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
finished okay so I'm pushing down and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.460 
finished okay so I'm pushing down and
you<00:05:50.520> can<00:05:50.669> see<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.570> configuration<00:05:52.320> of

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
you can see that the configuration of

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.529 
you can see that the configuration of
the<00:05:52.950> zigzag<00:05:53.490> is<00:05:53.700> now<00:05:53.880> coming<00:05:54.180> over<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.450> the

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
the zigzag is now coming over to the

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:55.730 
the zigzag is now coming over to the
bottom

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
bottom

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.160 
bottom
okay<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.100> let's<00:05:57.280> go<00:05:57.550> one<00:05:57.700> last<00:05:57.880> time<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:58.930> we<00:05:58.960> go

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
okay so let's go one last time so we go

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.560 
okay so let's go one last time so we go
over<00:06:00.120> okay<00:06:01.120> under<00:06:02.400> okay<00:06:03.400> and<00:06:03.610> then<00:06:04.210> straight

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
over okay under okay and then straight

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.070 
over okay under okay and then straight
across<00:06:05.220> over<00:06:06.220> and<00:06:06.970> now<00:06:07.510> down<00:06:08.880> okay<00:06:09.880> so<00:06:10.390> you

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
across over and now down okay so you

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.210 
across over and now down okay so you
just<00:06:11.230> have<00:06:11.410> to<00:06:11.470> look<00:06:11.680> that<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:12.040> make<00:06:12.190> sure

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
just have to look that you make sure

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.010 
just have to look that you make sure
that<00:06:12.400> that<00:06:12.610> Criss<00:06:13.000> crosses<00:06:13.450> at<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.660> edge<00:06:13.810> if

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
that that Criss crosses at the edge if

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.470 
that that Criss crosses at the edge if
you<00:06:14.140> do<00:06:14.290> not<00:06:14.410> crisscross<00:06:15.040> and<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:16.000> go<00:06:16.150> like

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
you do not crisscross and you go like

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.000 
you do not crisscross and you go like
this<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:19.330> you<00:06:19.390> go<00:06:19.570> like<00:06:19.690> this<00:06:19.750> what<00:06:20.590> happens

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
this and you go like this what happens

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.550 
this and you go like this what happens
is<00:06:21.220> that<00:06:21.250> when<00:06:21.580> you<00:06:21.610> go<00:06:21.790> to<00:06:21.820> push<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.330> off<00:06:22.570> you

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
is that when you go to push that off you

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.620 
is that when you go to push that off you
it's<00:06:23.980> not<00:06:24.160> it's<00:06:24.370> gonna<00:06:24.520> do<00:06:24.970> your<00:06:25.120> project<00:06:25.510> it's

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
it's not it's gonna do your project it's

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.600 
it's not it's gonna do your project it's
totally<00:06:25.960> gonna<00:06:26.080> fall<00:06:26.320> apart<00:06:26.440> so<00:06:27.160> you<00:06:27.250> have<00:06:27.430> to

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
totally gonna fall apart so you have to

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.840 
totally gonna fall apart so you have to
make<00:06:27.760> sure<00:06:27.790> it<00:06:28.180> does<00:06:28.360> do<00:06:28.600> that<00:06:28.630> criss<00:06:29.050> cross

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
make sure it does do that criss cross

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.830 
make sure it does do that criss cross
just<00:06:30.850> like<00:06:30.910> so<00:06:32.880> okay<00:06:33.880> and<00:06:34.090> now<00:06:34.270> we<00:06:34.330> just<00:06:34.630> follow

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
just like so okay and now we just follow

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.250 
just like so okay and now we just follow
the<00:06:35.050> same<00:06:35.260> configuration<00:06:39.660> and<00:06:40.660> again<00:06:40.870> it's

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
the same configuration and again it's

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.200 
the same configuration and again it's
just<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.560> matter<00:06:41.710> of<00:06:41.860> getting<00:06:42.040> used<00:06:42.640> to<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:43.060> way

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
just a matter of getting used to the way

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.190 
just a matter of getting used to the way
that<00:06:43.420> it's<00:06:43.950> twisting<00:06:45.330> on<00:06:46.330> there<00:06:46.690> and<00:06:46.840> you'll

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
that it's twisting on there and you'll

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.900 
that it's twisting on there and you'll
find<00:06:47.560> that<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:47.860> go<00:06:48.040> really<00:06:48.220> fast<00:06:48.340> I've<00:06:48.760> not

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
find that you go really fast I've not

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.810 
find that you go really fast I've not
done<00:06:49.090> a<00:06:49.150> whole<00:06:49.330> project<00:06:49.780> like<00:06:49.930> this<00:06:50.080> yet<00:06:50.920> but<00:06:51.790> I

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
done a whole project like this yet but I

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.660 
done a whole project like this yet but I
do<00:06:51.940> like<00:06:52.270> the<00:06:52.510> look<00:06:52.660> of<00:06:52.870> what<00:06:53.140> creates<00:06:53.670> creates

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
do like the look of what creates creates

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.140 
do like the look of what creates creates
a<00:06:54.760> really<00:06:55.120> kind<00:06:55.480> of<00:06:55.540> very<00:06:55.900> wavy<00:06:56.940> concept<00:06:57.940> so<00:06:58.120> I

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
a really kind of very wavy concept so I

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.550 
a really kind of very wavy concept so I
don't<00:06:58.450> know<00:06:58.540> what<00:06:58.660> you'll<00:06:58.810> be<00:06:58.960> using<00:06:58.990> it<00:06:59.380> for

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
don't know what you'll be using it for

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.990 
don't know what you'll be using it for
but<00:06:59.680> this<00:06:59.830> would<00:06:59.980> be<00:07:00.100> a<00:07:00.130> great<00:07:00.340> table<00:07:00.640> runner

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
but this would be a great table runner

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.100 
but this would be a great table runner
maybe<00:07:01.780> even<00:07:02.020> a<00:07:02.110> placemat<00:07:02.620> I<00:07:03.720> guess<00:07:04.720> the<00:07:04.840> sky's

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
maybe even a placemat I guess the sky's

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.070 
maybe even a placemat I guess the sky's
the<00:07:05.140> limit<00:07:05.320> on<00:07:05.680> what<00:07:05.800> you<00:07:05.830> can<00:07:05.950> use<00:07:06.250> this<00:07:07.080> loom

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
the limit on what you can use this loom

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.170 
the limit on what you can use this loom
knitting<00:07:08.320> for<00:07:08.590> so<00:07:09.160> this<00:07:09.370> was<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.730> honeycomb

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
knitting for so this was the honeycomb

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.560 
knitting for so this was the honeycomb
stitch<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:11.590> good<00:07:12.160> luck<00:07:12.280> with<00:07:12.490> that<00:07:12.520> and<00:07:12.850> we'll

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
stitch and good luck with that and we'll

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:27.410 
stitch and good luck with that and we'll
see<00:07:13.720> you<00:07:13.810> guys<00:07:13.960> next<00:07:14.170> time
