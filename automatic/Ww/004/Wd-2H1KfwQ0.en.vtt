00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.380
 I spoke with the charges and still wanted 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.840
 come the situations because they do not know 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.869
 They also gave me since I went to Chivas 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.360
 I tried to come did not normally 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.400
 every year we look for that it could be 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.330
 come back because we are both 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.490
 interested in puebla and me and good is given 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.010
 until now in some circumstances a 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.130
 little complicated for the club but I 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.270
 I think the managers and me and what 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.120
 I see the coaching staff and players 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 We really want to reverse this not 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.370
 I think it's not a place where 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.579
 a place in the descent table that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.590
 we would like to be more we are there and there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.570
 have to fight to get out of there 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 fight for people to return to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 stadium because they will believe in the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.650
 town and well I think we're all going with 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.239
 the same idea with the same goal and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.159
 we see very well I have that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 foreboding and that's why I accepted 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.659
 well and I love this team is my team 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 that my father used to take me 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.990
 I wore the cuauhtemoc and I dreamed some 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.149
 day wear the shirt and it's what 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 right now I'm going to do it again then 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.380
 I focus on that, no, I can not tell you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.170
 well wrong because also many times in 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.860
 football can be a team and kisses 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.289
 at the start good, well, I do not know if it was 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 also or plays very well and yet 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.509
 on the court shows you completely 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.729
 another thing not then in soccer the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.429
 last word is the court is what 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.980
 happens the results and well let's 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.130
 wait for that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.250
 I do not think I do not think we're going to save 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.610
 let's do things right and it's the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.160
 right now the goal that is in mind I 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.860
 I think this team the days that I have 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.990
 here it looks very solid if you give yourself 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.170
 account if they brought people but 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.390
 there is also there is a base that is 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 important 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.940
 there are hierarchy players and players 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 who have been champions I think we're going 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.370
 to be very very very good paper but 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.100
 also talk about our second 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.930
 objective I think right now in this 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.750
 moment that everything starts the tournament is not going 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.000
 first you have to take out the points of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.790
 local draw visitor points play 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.360
 well save us and hence things 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.360
 good will come
