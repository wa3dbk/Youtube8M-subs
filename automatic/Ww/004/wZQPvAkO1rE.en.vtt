00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
that the own the search tenkai it is

of the end of continuing continuous trap

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.900

so<00:04:00.739> if<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:00.980> play<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.370> taking<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.850> on

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
so if you play it is taking you on

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.970 
so if you play it is taking you on
search<00:04:02.209> they'll<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.930> say<00:04:03.170> no<00:04:03.410> i'll<00:04:03.739> change

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
search they'll just say no i'll change

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.340 
search they'll just say no i'll change
the<00:04:04.100> MST<00:04:04.640> it's<00:04:05.239> still<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> continuous<00:04:06.170> worth

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
the MST it's still a continuous worth

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.680 
the MST it's still a continuous worth
the<00:04:06.470> same<00:04:06.680> way<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.160> they'll<00:04:07.910> blow<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.359> before

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
the same way and they'll blow up before

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.770 
the same way and they'll blow up before
it<00:04:08.840> gets<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.320> effect<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.940> it's<00:04:11.420> best<00:04:11.600> to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
it gets the effect so it's best to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.569 
it gets the effect so it's best to
always<00:04:11.959> clear<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.650> back<00:04:12.829> row<00:04:13.070> because<00:04:13.280> people

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
always clear the back row because people

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.910 
always clear the back row because people
will<00:04:13.730> set<00:04:14.120> blinded<00:04:14.570> messy<00:04:14.900> or<00:04:15.230> same<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:15.739> he

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.120 
will set blinded messy or same as he
that's<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.940> just<00:04:17.930> thinking<00:04:18.289> you<00:04:18.590> know<00:04:18.620> strap
