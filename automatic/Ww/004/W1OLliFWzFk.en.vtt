roads and then they go and put their
game<00:01:58.270> design<00:01:58.630> twist<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.530> each<00:01:59.800> each

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
game design twist on it so each each

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.350 
game design twist on it so each each
road<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:02.200> they're<00:02:02.920> build<00:02:03.220> it's<00:02:03.640> it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
road is because they're build it's it's

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.910 
road is because they're build it's it's
designed<00:02:04.780> by<00:02:04.929> them<00:02:05.140> they<00:02:05.350> make<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:05.890> that

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
designed by them they make it so that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.880 
designed by them they make it so that
it's<00:02:06.190> fun<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.550> play<00:02:06.759> but<00:02:07.479> it's<00:02:07.600> all<00:02:07.810> based<00:02:08.619> in

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
it's fun to play but it's all based in

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.370 
it's fun to play but it's all based in
this<00:02:08.950> photo<00:02:09.190> realistic<00:02:09.580> environment<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.569> it's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
this photo realistic environment so it's

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.020 
this photo realistic environment so it's
an<00:02:11.500> accurate<00:02:11.769> location<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.610> where<00:02:12.790> rally

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
an accurate location is where rally

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
an accurate location is where rally
takes<00:02:13.330> place<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:14.019> but<00:02:14.410> we've<00:02:14.560> given<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.920> that

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
takes place but but we've given it that

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.660 
takes place but but we've given it that
game<00:02:15.310> twist<00:02:16.019> so<00:02:17.019> as<00:02:17.890> you're<00:02:18.160> seeing<00:02:18.340> in<00:02:18.519> this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
game twist so as you're seeing in this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.550 
game twist so as you're seeing in this
replay<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.360> can<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> car<00:02:19.930> moving<00:02:20.380> around

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
replay you can see the car moving around

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320 
replay you can see the car moving around
on<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.830> suspension<00:02:21.250> something<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.239> our

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
on this suspension something that our

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.670 
on this suspension something that our

physics programmers and our vehicle
handling<00:02:23.980> design<00:02:24.310> has<00:02:24.430> been<00:02:24.580> working<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.060> to

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
handling design has been working on to

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.630 
handling design has been working on to
make<00:02:26.140> sure<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.560> cars<00:02:26.799> physics<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.519> more

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
make sure that the cars physics and more

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
make sure that the cars physics and more
accurately<00:02:28.060> modeled<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.540> dirt<00:02:28.750> three<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.560> were

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
accurately modeled in dirt three we were

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.690 
accurately modeled in dirt three we were
really<00:02:29.829> happy<00:02:30.160> with<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.370> way<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
really happy with the way that the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.490 
really happy with the way that the
vehicle<00:02:31.000> handling<00:02:31.299> was<00:02:31.450> going<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.810> dirty<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
vehicle handling was going in dirty and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.860 
vehicle handling was going in dirty and
so<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.549> built<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:33.910> foundation<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.720> dirt

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
so we built on that foundation for dirt

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.289 
so we built on that foundation for dirt
three<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.549> I'm<00:02:36.549> really<00:02:36.790> happy<00:02:36.910> with<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> way

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
three and I'm really happy with the way

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.840 
three and I'm really happy with the way
it's<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.350> center<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.190> mass<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.640> car

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it's going the center of mass on the car

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.789 
it's going the center of mass on the car
now<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.239> raised<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.109> more<00:02:41.290> accurate<00:02:41.440> level

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
now is raised to a more accurate level

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.819 
now is raised to a more accurate level
and<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.670> means<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.290> player<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.680> able

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
and that means that the player is able

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.560 
and that means that the player is able
to<00:02:45.130> feel<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.640> weight<00:02:45.820> shifting<00:02:46.269> around<00:02:46.450> in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
to feel the weight shifting around in

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.060 
to feel the weight shifting around in
the<00:02:46.690> car<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.380> they<00:02:47.500> throw<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.890> car

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
the car and so they throw the car

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250 
the car and so they throw the car
sideways<00:02:48.400> into<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.910> corner<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:50.019> car

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
sideways into a corner and that car

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890 
sideways into a corner and that car
behaves<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.950> lot<00:02:51.070> more<00:02:51.250> accurately<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:52.570> top<00:02:52.780> of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
behaves a lot more accurately on top of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.330 
behaves a lot more accurately on top of
that<00:02:52.989> we've<00:02:53.170> got<00:02:53.380> more<00:02:53.410> accurately<00:02:54.010> model

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
that we've got more accurately model

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
that we've got more accurately model
client<00:02:54.640> visits<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.299> size<00:02:55.780> flexing<00:02:56.380> on

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
client visits so that size flexing on

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.140 
client visits so that size flexing on
the<00:02:56.590> rim<00:02:56.769> it's<00:02:57.310> quite<00:02:57.459> hard<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.700> pick<00:02:57.850> out<00:02:58.030> in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the rim it's quite hard to pick out in

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.809 
the rim it's quite hard to pick out in
these<00:02:58.209> replays<00:02:58.660> but<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:59.350> there<00:02:59.620> as<00:02:59.799> happening

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
these replays but is there as happening

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.369 
these replays but is there as happening
course<00:03:01.060> our<00:03:01.450> damaged<00:03:01.810> systems<00:03:01.989> always

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
course our damaged systems always

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.860 
course our damaged systems always
improved<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.040> well<00:03:03.069> so<00:03:03.549> when<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.329> smash<00:03:04.689> up

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
improved as well so when you smash up

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.929 
improved as well so when you smash up
the<00:03:04.900> car<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.650> start<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.129> feel<00:03:06.310> those<00:03:06.519> effects

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
the car you start to feel those effects

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.849 
the car you start to feel those effects
in<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.450> handling<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.709> things

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
in in the handling one of the things

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.520 
in in the handling one of the things
that<00:03:09.010> we've<00:03:09.099> got<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.400> time<00:03:09.639> out<00:03:09.819> is<00:03:10.530> punches

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
that we've got this time out is punches

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.009 
that we've got this time out is punches
so<00:03:11.889> if<00:03:12.189> you<00:03:12.310> keep<00:03:13.150> hitting<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.480> wheel<00:03:13.659> against

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
so if you keep hitting the wheel against

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.390 
so if you keep hitting the wheel against
the<00:03:14.109> side<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.439> track<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.189> will<00:03:15.310> eventually

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the side of the track it will eventually

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.640 
the side of the track it will eventually
blow<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.939> tire<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.870> keep<00:03:17.109> driving<00:03:17.379> on

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
blow the tire out you keep driving on

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.559 
blow the tire out you keep driving on
that<00:03:17.859> on<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.129> RIM<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.700> trial<00:03:18.969> of<00:03:19.060> thread<00:03:19.359> and

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
that on that RIM the trial of thread and

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.330 
that on that RIM the trial of thread and
unless<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.930> fall<00:03:20.170> off<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.319> rim<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.189> you'll

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
unless you fall off the rim so you'll

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.479 
unless you fall off the rim so you'll
start<00:03:22.209> driving<00:03:22.629> on<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.950> station<00:03:30.189> you've
