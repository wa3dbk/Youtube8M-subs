building

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.200 
building
I<00:01:53.350> usually<00:01:54.340> use<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.460> 13<00:01:55.360> by<00:01:55.540> 13<00:01:55.740> building

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
I usually use a 13 by 13 building

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.660 
I usually use a 13 by 13 building
sufficient<00:01:58.210> enough<00:01:58.620> then<00:01:59.620> I<00:01:59.800> build<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.190> large

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
sufficient enough then I build a large

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
sufficient enough then I build a large
cell<00:02:01.450> door<00:02:02.040> from<00:02:03.040> under<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.370> second

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.449 

all<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> build<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> stack

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
all right then going to build a stack

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:20.670 
all right then going to build a stack
door<00:02:13.160> there<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.280> go

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.170 

and<00:02:21.129> then<00:02:21.280> I'm<00:02:21.459> just<00:02:21.549> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.909> make<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and then I'm just going to make the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.660 
and then I'm just going to make the
deliveries<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.049> little<00:02:23.349> bigger<00:02:23.560> because<00:02:24.280> it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
deliveries a little bigger because it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.399 
deliveries a little bigger because it's
always<00:02:24.819> too<00:02:25.090> small<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.569> same<00:02:26.049> with<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
always too small and same with the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.899 
always too small and same with the

kitchen<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.939> a<00:02:49.090> cantina<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.230> eat

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
kitchen and a cantina so they can eat

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.990 
kitchen and a cantina so they can eat
for<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.569> holding<00:02:52.870> cell<00:02:53.760> supplies<00:02:54.760> we're

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
for the holding cell supplies we're

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.559 
for the holding cell supplies we're
gonna<00:02:55.120> need<00:02:55.299> is<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.629> toilet<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.829> bench

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.910 
gonna need is a toilet and a bench
preferably<00:02:58.569> if<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.140> toilet<00:02:59.530> would<00:02:59.709> work

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
preferably if the toilet would work

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.270 
preferably if the toilet would work
think<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.879> prisoners<00:03:01.329> would<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.719> that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
think the prisoners would like that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.230 
think the prisoners would like that
and<00:03:03.480> they<00:03:04.480> would<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.900> course<00:03:05.110> love<00:03:05.350> pops<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
and they would of course love pops and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.610 
and they would of course love pops and
I'm<00:03:07.240> going<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> build<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> generators<00:03:08.320> right

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
I'm going to build the generators right

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.490 
I'm going to build the generators right
now

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
now

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.100 
now
and<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:11.460> put<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> capacitors<00:03:12.330> around<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
and then put the capacitors around the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.760 
and then put the capacitors around the
generator<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:15.690> maximize<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.590> power

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
generator so we can maximize the power

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.100 
generator so we can maximize the power
use

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110

mistake use small pipes for as far as

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.870 
mistake use small pipes for as far as
it'll<00:04:23.510> go<00:04:23.630> because<00:04:24.320> when<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.310> use<00:04:25.490> large

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
it'll go because when you use large

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.270 
it'll go because when you use large
pipes<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.449> can<00:04:26.630> dig<00:04:26.900> holes<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.710> then<00:04:27.800> escape

pipes that can dig holes and then escape
the<00:04:28.550> prison<00:04:28.789> so<00:04:29.270> you'll<00:04:29.510> want<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.139> try<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.560> use

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
the prison so you'll want to try to use

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.050 
the prison so you'll want to try to use
small<00:04:31.190> pipes<00:04:31.490> as<00:04:31.669> long<00:04:32.570> as<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.900> can

all<00:04:35.630> right<00:04:35.780> my<00:04:36.650> waters<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.280> got<00:04:37.490> stuff

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:50.159 

electrical<00:04:43.599> cables<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.319> power<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:46.060> lights

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.809 

wrong<00:04:50.919> way<00:04:51.159> okay<00:04:51.370> there<00:04:51.819> we<00:04:51.879> go<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.860> it'll<00:04:53.860> it

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
wrong way okay there we go and it'll it

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.939 
wrong way okay there we go and it'll it
will<00:04:54.849> power<00:04:55.180> all<00:04:55.479> lights<00:04:55.719> within<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.229> area<00:04:56.680> so

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
will power all lights within the area so

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.910 
will power all lights within the area so
you<00:04:57.009> don't<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.719> match<00:04:58.719> it<00:04:58.900> with<00:04:58.930> all

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
you don't have to match it with all

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.990 
you don't have to match it with all
you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.300 

working<00:05:07.000> on<00:05:07.120> that<00:05:07.380> usually<00:05:08.380> takes<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.800> while<00:05:08.980> so

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
working on that usually takes a while so

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.520 
working on that usually takes a while so
I<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.670> would<00:05:10.060> click<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.390> fast-forward<00:05:11.260> button

I I would click the fast-forward button
like<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.980> did<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:13.030> would<00:05:13.270> speed<00:05:13.570> things<00:05:13.600> up

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220
