separate<00:02:14.790> entrance<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.480> stuff<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:15.780> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
separate entrance and stuff like that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.010 
separate entrance and stuff like that
and<00:02:16.050> squirrels<00:02:16.680> ourselves<00:02:17.130> away<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.020> we

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
and squirrels ourselves away and we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.230 
and squirrels ourselves away and we
started<00:02:19.440> working<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.860> prototype<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.730> no

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
started working on prototype for no

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600 
started working on prototype for no
man's<00:02:21.450> sky<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.100> didn't<00:02:23.430> show

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
man's sky and we actually didn't show

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.340 
man's sky and we actually didn't show
the<00:02:23.790> rest<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.209> team<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.140> just

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the rest of the team because we just

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.000 
the rest of the team because we just
wanted<00:02:27.140> almost<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> pressure<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
wanted almost the pressure and the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.340 
wanted almost the pressure and the
isolation<00:02:29.760> almost<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.870> start

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
isolation almost like it was it I start

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.550 
isolation almost like it was it I start
up<00:02:31.590> within<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.790> small<00:02:33.000> studio<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:34.410> had

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
up within this small studio that had

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
up within this small studio that had
proved<00:02:35.010> themselves<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.930> worked<00:02:37.170> for

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
proved themselves and so we worked for

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.510 
proved themselves and so we worked for
for<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> year<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
for a year actually on that that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.500 
for a year actually on that that
prototype<00:02:41.520> which<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.120> turned<00:02:42.390> into

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
prototype which then turned into

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.330 
prototype which then turned into
something<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:43.050> bigger<00:02:43.320> which<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.100> what<00:02:44.250> we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
something much bigger which is what we

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.360 
something much bigger which is what we
first<00:02:44.610> showed<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.330> BG<00:02:45.810> X's<00:02:46.580> for<00:02:47.580> me

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.080 

Christmas<00:02:54.299> Eve<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.930> got<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:55.760> text<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.970> then

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
Christmas Eve I got like a text and then

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
Christmas Eve I got like a text and then
called<00:02:57.420> saying<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.190> officers

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
called saying like the the officers

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.720 
called saying like the the officers
started<00:02:59.940> floods<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.730> space

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
started floods this this kind of space

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.460 
started floods this this kind of space
that<00:03:02.909> we'd<00:03:03.330> done<00:03:03.599> up<00:03:03.720> ourselves<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
crappy loaf I way you know within a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.900 
crappy loaf I way you know within a
couple<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.319> weeks<00:03:25.379> actually<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:26.190> were<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.760> were

set up and and that was definitely like
in<00:03:30.090> indie<00:03:30.900> development<00:03:31.379> in<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.030> microcosm

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
in indie development in like a microcosm

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.880 
in indie development in like a microcosm
it's<00:03:33.569> like<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> highs<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.739> you've

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's like the highs of like you've

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's like the highs of like you've
announced<00:03:35.129> again<00:03:35.430> people<00:03:36.120> others<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.870> know

the community like it games the
community<00:03:53.609> in<00:03:53.730> general<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:54.890> completely

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
community in general was completely

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.650 
community in general was completely
restored<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.640> point<00:03:56.909> you<00:03:57.150> know<00:03:57.450> and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
restored at that point you know and

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.500 
restored at that point you know and
times<00:03:58.500> like<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:58.859> is<00:03:59.069> an<00:03:59.190> e3<00:03:59.400> we've<00:04:00.000> had<00:04:00.209> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
times like this is an e3 we've had so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.080 
times like this is an e3 we've had so
much<00:04:00.690> positivity<00:04:01.470> about<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.040> game<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.910> know

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
much positivity about the game you know

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.409 
much positivity about the game you know
like<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:03.930> never<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.620> where<00:04:05.489> where

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
like you just never see that where where

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.869 
like you just never see that where where
people<00:04:07.260> really<00:04:07.410> get<00:04:07.950> behind<00:04:08.130> something<00:04:08.489> in

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
people really get behind something in

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.569 
people really get behind something in
such<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> big<00:04:09.359> way<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:10.169> that's<00:04:10.579> massively

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
such a big way then that's massively

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.550 
such a big way then that's massively
massively<00:04:11.910> meaningful<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.019> us<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.349> really

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
massively meaningful to us and really

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.410 
massively meaningful to us and really
fool<00:04:14.040> fuels<00:04:14.549> you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.730 

there<00:04:21.420> is<00:04:21.540> this<00:04:21.660> thing<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.290> sat<00:04:22.530> in

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
there is this thing that it's sat in

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.340 
there is this thing that it's sat in
this<00:04:22.890> infinite<00:04:23.520> procedurally<00:04:24.300> generated

that<00:04:30.870> we<00:04:31.550> had<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.820> idea<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.510> making<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.800> game

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
that we had the idea of making a game

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.500 
that we had the idea of making a game
that<00:04:35.390> felt<00:04:36.390> true<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:38.310> kind<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.640> scifi

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
that felt true to the kind of scifi

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.750 
that felt true to the kind of scifi
books<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:40.020> we've<00:04:40.170> grown<00:04:40.380> up<00:04:40.440> with<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.490> kind

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
books that we've grown up with the kind

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.540 
books that we've grown up with the kind
of<00:04:41.820> idea<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.750> fantasy<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.560> and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
of idea of that the fantasy of that and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.850 
of idea of that the fantasy of that and
we<00:04:44.760> wanted<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.150> deliver<00:04:45.450> on<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.560> do

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
we wanted to deliver on that and to do

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.460 
we wanted to deliver on that and to do
that<00:04:47.130> we<00:04:47.370> had<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.610> create<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.630> universe<00:04:48.870> feed

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
that we had to create the universe feed

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.900 
that we had to create the universe feed
to<00:04:49.650> explore<00:04:50.010> because<00:04:50.340> that's<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.670> feeling

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
to explore because that's the feeling

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.330 
to explore because that's the feeling
that<00:04:51.240> we<00:04:51.330> wanted<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.900> have<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.410> one<00:04:53.250> of

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
that's what's interesting to me I'm

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.440 
that's what's interesting to me I'm
really<00:05:38.250> interested<00:05:38.580> by<00:05:38.970> things<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.360> are

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
really interested by things that are

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.380 
really interested by things that are
less<00:05:39.690> descriptive<00:05:40.500> actually<00:05:41.340> unless<00:05:41.460> you

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
less descriptive actually unless you

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.410 
less descriptive actually unless you
know<00:05:42.680> hard<00:05:43.680> coded<00:05:44.130> about<00:05:44.370> what<00:05:44.580> way<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.030> have

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
know hard coded about what way you have

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.390 
know hard coded about what way you have
to<00:05:45.570> play<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.590> don't<00:05:46.770> start<00:05:47.220> with<00:05:47.280> a

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
to play it and that don't start with a

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.130 
to play it and that don't start with a
tutorial<00:05:47.820> and<00:05:48.180> it<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.450> kind<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.720> land<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.110> in

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
tutorial and it just kind of land you in

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.810 
tutorial and it just kind of land you in
and<00:05:49.410> let<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.710> off<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:50.160> make<00:05:50.280> your<00:05:50.430> own<00:05:50.550> fun

and let you off to make your own fun
having<00:05:51.600> said<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:52.110> isn't<00:05:52.410> just<00:05:52.620> like<00:05:52.830> some

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
having said that it isn't just like some

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.120 
having said that it isn't just like some
sort<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.610> empty<00:05:54.450> blank<00:05:54.840> canvas<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:56.010> know

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
sort of empty blank canvas you know

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.550 
sort of empty blank canvas you know
there<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.430> law<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.780> universe<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.440> their

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
there is a law to the universe and their

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.740 
there is a law to the universe and their
decisions<00:05:59.010> that<00:05:59.160> we<00:05:59.250> make<00:05:59.460> based<00:05:59.940> on<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.450> and

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
decisions that we make based on that and

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.510 
decisions that we make based on that and
it<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:02.280> has<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.580> personality<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:04.520> is

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
it is it has a personality and it is

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.360 
it is it has a personality and it is
generally<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.240> pretty<00:06:06.560> dangerous<00:06:07.560> place<00:06:07.950> to<00:06:08.340> be

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
generally a pretty dangerous place to be

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.730 
generally a pretty dangerous place to be
as<00:06:08.730> it<00:06:09.000> should<00:06:09.030> be<00:06:09.450> kind<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.960> sci-fi<00:06:10.200> it

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
as it should be kind of a sci-fi it

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.910 
as it should be kind of a sci-fi it
isn't<00:06:11.100> just<00:06:11.280> some<00:06:11.580> ambient<00:06:12.360> utopia<00:06:13.050> but<00:06:13.740> you

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
isn't just some ambient utopia but you

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.580 
isn't just some ambient utopia but you
are<00:06:14.100> always<00:06:14.340> in<00:06:14.670> danger<00:06:15.290> actually<00:06:16.290> everyone

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
are always in danger actually everyone

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.590 
are always in danger actually everyone
starts<00:06:17.190> on<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.520> on<00:06:17.730> a<00:06:17.760> different<00:06:18.000> planet<00:06:18.330> but

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
starts on it on a different planet but

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.120 
starts on it on a different planet but
around<00:06:18.810> starts<00:06:19.200> and<00:06:19.380> different<00:06:19.650> plan<00:06:19.800> on<00:06:19.980> the

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
around starts and different plan on the

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.180 
around starts and different plan on the
outside<00:06:20.550> edge<00:06:20.760> of<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.150> galaxy<00:06:21.920> and<00:06:22.920> they<00:06:23.040> all

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
outside edge of the galaxy and they all

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.690 
outside edge of the galaxy and they all
share<00:06:23.430> that<00:06:23.670> same<00:06:23.850> galaxy<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.920> and<00:06:25.920> for<00:06:26.490> most

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
share that same galaxy and and for most

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.880 
share that same galaxy and and for most
people<00:06:27.150> they<00:06:27.600> will<00:06:27.780> try<00:06:28.110> and<00:06:28.140> make<00:06:28.440> the

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
people they will try and make the

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.590 
people they will try and make the
journey<00:06:29.100> to<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.460> center<00:06:29.850> of<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.060> galaxy<00:06:30.210> and

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
journey to the center of the galaxy and

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.760 
journey to the center of the galaxy and
there's<00:06:30.750> a<00:06:30.810> reason<00:06:31.110> why<00:06:31.230> you<00:06:31.290> would<00:06:31.470> want<00:06:31.500> to

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
they will need to plan and they will

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.800 
they will need to plan and they will

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
need to cooperate with other players to

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.420 
need to cooperate with other players to
an<00:06:48.870> extent<00:06:49.320> and<00:06:49.670> and<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:51.810> they<00:06:52.350> will<00:06:52.620> actually

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
an extent and and and they will actually

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.910 
an extent and and and they will actually
need<00:06:53.460> to<00:06:53.640> be<00:06:53.760> quite<00:06:53.970> clever<00:06:54.240> and<00:06:54.770> there<00:06:55.770> is<00:06:55.890> a

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
need to be quite clever and there is a

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.040 
need to be quite clever and there is a
game<00:06:56.160> beyond<00:06:56.490> that<00:06:56.670> and<00:06:56.880> you<00:06:57.030> can<00:06:57.210> continue<00:06:57.930> to

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
game beyond that and you can continue to

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.100 
game beyond that and you can continue to
play<00:06:58.340> but<00:06:59.340> for<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.610> lot<00:06:59.730> of<00:06:59.790> people<00:06:59.910> that's<00:07:00.660> the

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
play but for a lot of people that's the

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.990 
play but for a lot of people that's the
core<00:07:01.470> journey<00:07:01.860> that<00:07:02.160> they<00:07:02.280> will<00:07:02.460> be<00:07:02.610> on<00:07:02.790> they

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
core journey that they will be on they

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.910 
core journey that they will be on they
will<00:07:03.180> think<00:07:03.390> I<00:07:03.630> started<00:07:04.350> out<00:07:04.500> with<00:07:04.740> the

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
will think I started out with the

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.980 
will think I started out with the
smallest<00:07:05.400> crappier<00:07:05.910> ship<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.570> could<00:07:06.750> imagine

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
smallest crappier ship you could imagine

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.620 
smallest crappier ship you could imagine
and<00:07:07.470> I<00:07:08.130> got<00:07:08.460> to<00:07:08.670> a<00:07:08.700> point<00:07:08.970> where<00:07:09.150> I<00:07:09.240> could<00:07:09.480> get

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
and I got to a point where I could get

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.510 
and I got to a point where I could get
to<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:09.930> center<00:07:10.170> of<00:07:10.380> galaxies<00:07:11.010> and<00:07:11.160> see<00:07:11.280> what

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
to the center of galaxies and see what

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
to the center of galaxies and see what
was<00:07:11.640> there

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
was there

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:25.570 
was there
and<00:07:12.660> we<00:07:13.260> want<00:07:13.470> that<00:07:13.650> to<00:07:13.800> be<00:07:13.920> significant
