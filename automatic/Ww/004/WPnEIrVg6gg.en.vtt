00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and that sort of thing so seems like a

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.770 
and that sort of thing so seems like a
very<00:02:18.970> strange<00:02:19.360> coloring<00:02:19.870> game<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:21.780> finally

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780

whilst floating through islands with
Mario<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.959> Peach<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:45.099> I<00:02:45.370> guess<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.790> sounds

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
Mario and Peach so I guess it sounds

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.370 
Mario and Peach so I guess it sounds
like<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.360> pretty<00:02:46.540> good<00:02:46.690> way<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.840> learn<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.140> count

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
like a pretty good way to learn to count

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.970 
like a pretty good way to learn to count
I<00:02:47.590> guess<00:02:49.170> we'll<00:02:50.170> probably<00:02:50.290> do<00:02:50.500> another<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.890> of

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
I guess we'll probably do another one of

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.229 
I guess we'll probably do another one of
