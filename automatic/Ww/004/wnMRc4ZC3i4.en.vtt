 the time of publication of this article is also 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.869
 It turned out that the first thing we expect is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 new personality management system 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 words of developers they started 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.090
 grab a new control system yet 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:42.450
 with the version of the game 080 and any style 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.460
 the music in the game will be the same as in a 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.570
 until the media appears there 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.030
 there will be teams of many players 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 wanted to expect the team since 80 90 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.439
 squat is a very useful thing 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 the character will move very slowly 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.609
 possible to make from old not 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.789

 hardcore i'm personally i'm not a fan of this mode 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.709
 but I think the players will appreciate it on 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.299
 mobile switching capability 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:47.539
