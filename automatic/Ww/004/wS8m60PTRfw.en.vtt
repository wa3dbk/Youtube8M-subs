00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
on this new system on the right hand

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
on this new system on the right hand
side<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> characteristics<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
side we can see the characteristics of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.219 
side we can see the characteristics of
the<00:02:04.979> weapon<00:02:05.399> equipped<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.570> here's<00:02:07.020> what's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the weapon equipped now here's what's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
the weapon equipped now here's what's
neat<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.649> he<00:02:07.979> thumbs<00:02:08.340> through<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> different

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
neat as he thumbs through the different

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
neat as he thumbs through the different
weapons<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.599> compares<00:02:10.050> them<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
weapons it compares them this one it

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.160 
weapons it compares them this one it
gives<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.489> Agri<00:02:11.849> Street<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.840> range

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
gives you more Agri Street more range

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.850 
gives you more Agri Street more range
more

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
more
handling<00:02:14.310> little<00:02:14.760> less<00:02:14.940> mobility<00:02:15.300> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
handling little less mobility little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.900 
handling little less mobility little
less<00:02:16.080> damage<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.070> those<00:02:17.250> green<00:02:17.520> bars

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
less damage you can see those green bars

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.900 
less damage you can see those green bars
so<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.170> highly<00:02:19.470> useful<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:20.370> you're

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so that could be highly useful if you're

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
so that could be highly useful if you're
not<00:02:21.150> too<00:02:21.450> knowledgeable<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.290> weapons

going to want a better gun at those
ranges

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
ranges

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.780

that's<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.110> quick<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> figure<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.220> now<00:02:35.640> how

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that's a quick way to figure out now how

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 
that's a quick way to figure out now how
about<00:02:35.910> customizing<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.840> actual<00:02:37.350> weapon<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
about customizing the actual weapon and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.490 
about customizing the actual weapon and
here<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.280> more<00:02:38.610> unique<00:02:39.240> combinations<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
here are more unique combinations of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.620 
here are more unique combinations of
course<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.430> alpha<00:02:41.820> everything<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.390> not

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
course this is alpha everything is not

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.320 
course this is alpha everything is not
in<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.430> here's<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> couple<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> sites

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
in here and here's a couple of the sites

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.880 
in here and here's a couple of the sites
that<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.720> already<00:02:45.900> been<00:02:46.110> unlocked<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that have already been unlocked with the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
that have already been unlocked with the
magnifications<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.120> battlefield<00:02:48.600> 3

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
magnifications just like battlefield 3

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.199 
magnifications just like battlefield 3
but<00:02:48.959> look<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> there's<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.830> barrel<00:02:50.280> accessory

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
but look it there's a barrel accessory

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.590 
but look it there's a barrel accessory
and<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:52.320> under<00:02:52.739> barrel<00:02:53.070> slot<00:02:53.430> now<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.330> course

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
and a under barrel slot now of course

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
and a under barrel slot now of course
it'll<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.870> more<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> suppressor

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
it'll be more here like a suppressor

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.120 
it'll be more here like a suppressor
heavy<00:02:57.180> barrel<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:58.110> all<00:02:58.350> speculation<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
heavy barrel that's all speculation of

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.340 
heavy barrel that's all speculation of
course<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.880> here<00:03:00.110> look<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
course but right here look at the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.760 
course but right here look at the
accessory<00:03:02.120> canted<00:03:03.120> iron<00:03:03.390> sights<00:03:03.770> laser

pointer<00:03:05.340> green<00:03:06.180> laser<00:03:06.540> pointer<00:03:06.720> which<00:03:07.170> we've

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
pointer green laser pointer which we've

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.510 
pointer green laser pointer which we've
seen<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:09.030> multiplayer<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.520> under

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
seen in the multiplayer and the under

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.490 
seen in the multiplayer and the under
barrel<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:12.000> course<00:03:12.660> there's<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> grip<00:03:13.230> but

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
barrel of course there's a grip but

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.090 
barrel of course there's a grip but
there's<00:03:13.680> an<00:03:13.830> angle<00:03:14.280> grip<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.150> reduces

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
there's an angle grip and it reduces

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.550 
there's an angle grip and it reduces
initial<00:03:17.150> recoil<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.110> looks<00:03:19.290> like<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
initial recoil so it looks like you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.199 
initial recoil so it looks like you
might<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.950> choice<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.519> course<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.940> first

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
might have a choice of course the first

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.600 
might have a choice of course the first
bullet<00:03:21.480> kicks<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.019> hardest<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:23.340> course

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
bullet kicks the hardest and of course

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.100 
bullet kicks the hardest and of course
you<00:03:23.790> got<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> paint<00:03:24.540> job<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.900> got<00:03:25.019> to
