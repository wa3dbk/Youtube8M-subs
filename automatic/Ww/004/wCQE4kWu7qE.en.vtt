00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

I<00:00:00.060> picked<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.570> up<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:01.020> while<00:00:01.230> ago<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:01.829> a

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I picked this up a while ago at a

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.830 
I picked this up a while ago at a
discount<00:00:02.550> store<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:03.060> thought<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.449> was<00:00:03.540> kind<00:00:03.750> of

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
discount store I thought it was kind of

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.749 
discount store I thought it was kind of
interesting<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.440> realize<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.130> cheap<00:00:05.430> thing

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
interesting I realize it's a cheap thing

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.760 
interesting I realize it's a cheap thing
and<00:00:06.029> being<00:00:06.359> drill<00:00:06.690> powered<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.290> won't<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
and being drill powered it won't be the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740 
and being drill powered it won't be the
best<00:00:07.799> but<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.610> thought<00:00:08.849> I'd<00:00:08.970> give<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.240> shot<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
best but I thought I'd give this shot I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.390 
best but I thought I'd give this shot I
have<00:00:10.050> some<00:00:10.230> stuff<00:00:10.500> laying<00:00:10.769> around<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.340> would

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
have some stuff laying around that would

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.850 
have some stuff laying around that would
make<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> little<00:00:12.030> better<00:00:12.710> this<00:00:13.710> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
make this a little better this is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
make this a little better this is
everything<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.280> came<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.730> box<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
everything that came in the box and I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.400 
everything that came in the box and I
believe<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.170> everything<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:18.230> most<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
believe that everything here is most of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:01:26.510 
believe that everything here is most of
these<00:00:19.470> things<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.949> cast<00:00:20.279> aluminum

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.030 

there<00:01:27.520> when<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.729> get<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:27.970> all<00:01:28.090> mounted<00:01:28.540> up<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
there when you get it all mounted up it

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
there when you get it all mounted up it
probably<00:01:30.850> looks<00:01:31.030> something<00:01:31.150> like<00:01:31.479> this

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.899 

you<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.619> can't<00:01:41.860> get<00:01:42.039> anything<00:01:42.280> very<00:01:42.640> big

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
you really can't get anything very big

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.060 
you really can't get anything very big
in<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.180> like<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:44.020> actually<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
in here like this is actually the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.529 
in here like this is actually the
biggest<00:01:45.460> thing<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:46.000> could<00:01:46.210> put<00:01:46.390> in

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
biggest thing that you could put in

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.760 
biggest thing that you could put in
there<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.770> two<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.219> a<00:01:48.250> half<00:01:48.429> inches<00:01:49.770> it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:30.410 
forget to tighten that down comes with a
wrench
