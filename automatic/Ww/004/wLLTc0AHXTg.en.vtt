00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.420
 English word timelapse is called 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 time-lapse shooting slow 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 flowing processes and slowly 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.009
 moving objects frame by frame with 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.020
 the same time interval between 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.869
 frames for example 1k 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.720
 let's do this let 's collect the shots in 1 video in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 we need the adobe after program 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 effects 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 double click on an empty window 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.750
 project all shot frames must be in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 they are in the same folder in order 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 between which when shooting the interval between 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 my shots were 12 seconds 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 select the first frame 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.930
 next tick is not jack sequence 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.350
 she needs to defend it means that everything 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.970
 the files will merge into one sequence which 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 we will edit 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.790
 just do not lose files from the order 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.720
 because they are going to pore numbers 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.780
 form or letter order how many 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.159
 frames per second now you plan 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 show my shooting was 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.799
 scheduled for 25 frames per 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.400
 give me a sec 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.460
 Click the right mouse button on the sequence. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.540
 choose to interpret the main footage 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 set the right value as well 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.300
 mark through sight with square 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.640
 pizza hands on with your mouse 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.210
 sequences to his eldest 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.440
 and throw on the composition icon 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.040
 ready to opposition automatically 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.650
 Created the right size of the corresponding 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.050
 photo size and need 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.090
 duration based on 25 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.100
 frames per second 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.770
 look click spent to 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.620
 play video or play button 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.130
 here in the preview window, keep in mind the video 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.510
 not displayed in the real world now 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.270
 analyze our image 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.790
 it's done beforehand it all starts when 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.430
 sunset rays on the road 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 overcome the red clouds 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.580
 smoothly plunge into darkness and appear 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.070
 street electric lighting 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.370
 I will say right away the original pictures were 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.670
 made raw and underwent 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.910
 batch processing in lightroom and i 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.380
 made five different treatments for everyone 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.990
 frames that is his mind all 5 sets with 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.270
 different color correction to change 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.300
 the length of the sequence we take it by the tail and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.000
 longing for them to take from forward you can 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.850
 change the size of the work area dragging behind 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.760
 tail slider workspace but in 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.920
 In this case, we will return to the place 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.459
 the sequence has already been automatically created 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.830
 we need the size with the need to work 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.709
 the areas are now the next step 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.530
 smooth transition from one sequence to 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.870
 another so they smoothly category 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.390
 and for that we need a slow transition 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 otherwise it will notice a slow transition. 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.980
 it's about 1 2 seconds what 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.030
 corresponds to 25 and 50 frames 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.690
 select the top layer click on the keyboard 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.290
 tempo opened tab with parameter 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.019
 opacity put the key frames 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.690
 here is one hundred percent 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.100
 opacity click on timer it 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.590
 shows hour hour minute second and frames 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.000
 add one second + 25 frame 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.020
 please we moved to set 25 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.569
 opacity value 0 in this place 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.760
 now the opacity will go smoothly into 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.340
 during this time the same will happen 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.489
 most for the rest 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.390
 eat now stand away from the monitor 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.390
 a couple of steps 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.970
 image far from perfect and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.080
 Now we will bring it in order 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.620
 This means the first problem of flicker frames and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.760
 flickr if at least one parameter your 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.330
 the camera when shooting stood on the machine then 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 changing the ratio of dark and light 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.990
 frame elements will trigger change assistance 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.630
 the brightness of the entire frame create 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.060
 adjustment layer weir mill and hour 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.530
 minute unit i.e. adjustment layer 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.720
 here and we press on it the right button 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.510
 choose effects 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.250
 attention ji pi ji bi bi 2 flickr this 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.280
 plugin that you need to get 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.440
 and install it we really need and he 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.610
 solve this problem we can change 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.780
 effect parameters in the effect controls window 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.680
 most of the cases from tweaking by 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.550
 default solves all your problems 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.190
 However, if you have a difficult case 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.520
 and it does not help you i will make a separate 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.520
 lesson with again so the plugin is next 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.550
 obvious problem image for 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.280
 wobbly which osh to avoid it 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.130
 take the heaviest tripod to shoot 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.040
 which you only have to not 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.220
 shatalo inetresno wind and if you 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.830
 good battery put the machine mode 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.390
 live view and the mirror will be all the time 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.030
 open and will not create 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.000
 extra shock jerking in 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.160
 shooting time and open fully 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.670
 aperture or use mechanical 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.950
 the lens is not jumping aperture add 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.090
 music just so you will not hear only 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.790
 in preview mode 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.630
 so we'll go into it composition 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.630
 audio preview 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.190
 to stop you a space image 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.230
 can be stabilized here in the second 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.120
 I have a picture for there are solutions for easier 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.100
 lazy 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.370
 exporting our video file let's go 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.270
 recently raider cast and throw there 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.490
 our composition is a simple setting 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.509
 repeat 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.509
 everything is the same for me 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.809
 ready to upload the file on youtube click 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.089
 a button 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:43.729
 improvement or push to stabilize 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:46.860
 on the right we see the original nailed to the left 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.940
 the result is obvious they see perfectly 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.470
 I really like 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:56.090
 save look if you need you 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.760
 can download back swear tight 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.230
 the resulting file or if the file 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.050
 meant for youtube and then this 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.800
 ideal option in the description for this 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.600
 video 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.470
 under the video I go there a few hints 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.470
 but only to the interval number you choose 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.000
 depending on shooting conditions suppose 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.150
 fast slow and so on please 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.070
 click like or subscribe to the channel and 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.670
