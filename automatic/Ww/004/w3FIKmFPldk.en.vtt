00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.320
 Thanks again for joining us because

 we want to learn to make coffee 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 flavored and what better with an expert 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.880
 Colombian that teaches us who 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.880
 we help to make these coffee 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.070
 flavored good the truth is that the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.290
 idea is that you use different ideas 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.410
 creative in your true home and that we 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.480
 we can combine the delicious coffee as 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.980
 never place and chocolate essences hears a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.050
 important thing to show you here sticks 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.970
 of vanilla that you can leave 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.670
 this pod is a bit drier but 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.920
 put it like this in between sugar makes 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 that sugar that really with an aroma 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.100
 a wonderful fragrance that goes to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 obviously highlight these coffees that you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.240
 is going to teach us how to make coffee 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.240
 instant and soluble 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.310
 what do you have here 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.020
 we have something that in Colombia we use as 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 the coconut 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.750
 although rich try in tablespoons a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.750
 spoon says 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.940
 this is like a nut and we can put 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.710
 then as it has a nutty flavor you 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.930
 we can put it down just to decorate a 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 little one a new one cut them in the world 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.620
 and we have two coffee making options 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.750
 longer than what we're going to do with this 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.670
 of course let's then add a 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.870
 of essences can be this essence 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.350
 of cocoa 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.349
 I would like to use it that what you are not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.739
 prepare sugar with a little 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.739
 vanilla 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.239
 this rigor of extension and incidence of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.239
 liquor gave 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.660
 and added the water and I added the water 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.540
 that we remember the temperature from 88 to 95 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:39.310
 and there we are going to add a little touch 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.380
 another effect this too 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.890
 let's add let's do as a 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 pencil 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.630
 in fact without foam sparingly milk and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.989
 then we add foam 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.390
 this coffee accompanies very rich very well 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.190
 especially in this climate today it is rafa 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.110
 a little bit of chocolate really is not 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.670
 we are on the foam 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.710
 and that we finished with a little 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.540
 depending on what you have your coffees 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.540
 prepared with favorites 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.540
 I see it here and Carlos possible
