the<00:00:41.430> update<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.149> wondering<00:00:42.360> why<00:00:42.780> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the update now I'm wondering why they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
the update now I'm wondering why they
put<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.160> article<00:00:44.670> insta-kill

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
put that in this this article insta-kill

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
put that in this this article insta-kill
drop<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.440> shouldn't<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> something

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
drop that that shouldn't be something

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.650 
drop that that shouldn't be something
that's<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.670> significant<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that's so significant it's just a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
that's so significant it's just a
powerup<00:00:49.020> among<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.100> things<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
powerup among all the other things that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
powerup among all the other things that
we<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.700> zombies<00:00:51.090> easter<00:00:51.270> eggs<00:00:51.539> new

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

we have in zombies easter eggs new
weapons<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.680> stuff<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
weapons and all that stuff so that that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
weapons and all that stuff so that that
rings<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> bell<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.510> why<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:54.899> they

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
rings a bell right there why would they

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
rings a bell right there why would they
be<00:00:55.289> putting<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.770> even<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
be putting that in there even with the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
be putting that in there even with the
instant<00:00:57.090> kill<00:00:57.210> drop<00:00:57.480> being<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.050> effective

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
instant kill drop being so effective

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
instant kill drop being so effective
like<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> power<00:00:59.030> basically<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> Wonder

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
like a power basically like a Wonder

still there saying it's still the
hardest<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> map<00:01:05.189> ever<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.790> trying<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
hardest on the map ever just trying to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.399 
hardest on the map ever just trying to
find<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> decent<00:01:06.510> weapon<00:01:06.840> without<00:01:06.930> falling<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
find a decent weapon without falling to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
find a decent weapon without falling to
your<00:01:07.439> death<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> challenge<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
your death as a challenge which is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
your death as a challenge which is
really<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.479> sketching<00:01:10.020> me<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.200> there

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
really really sketching me out there

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
really really sketching me out there
trying<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> find<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> decent<00:01:11.369> weapon<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
trying to find a decent weapon that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.310 
trying to find a decent weapon that
makes<00:01:12.180> me<00:01:12.330> believe<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> weapons<00:01:13.140> aren't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
makes me believe that the weapons aren't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
makes me believe that the weapons aren't
very<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.590> either<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.729> zombies<00:01:15.090> are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
very good either that or the zombies are

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
very good either that or the zombies are
much<00:01:15.330> more<00:01:15.509> difficult<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.960> kill<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.409> something

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
much more difficult to kill or something

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
much more difficult to kill or something
like<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.479> hope<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> new

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like that but I really hope the new

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.090 
like that but I really hope the new
Wonder<00:01:19.080> weapon<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.070> there

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
Wonder weapon if there is one there

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
Wonder weapon if there is one there
better<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.090> much<00:01:21.900> more<00:01:22.140> effective

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
better be one is much more effective

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
better be one is much more effective
than<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> jack<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.270> for

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
than the jack on that is that is for

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
than the jack on that is that is for
certain<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.710> said<00:01:25.890> trying<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
certain but they said trying to go

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
certain but they said trying to go
around<00:01:26.580> without<00:01:26.790> phony<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> challenge

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
around without phony that is a challenge

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.819 
around without phony that is a challenge
so<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.960> assuming<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so I'm assuming is gonna be a lot of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
so I'm assuming is gonna be a lot of
like<00:01:29.100> random<00:01:29.700> holes<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> ground<00:01:30.720> Ricky

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
like random holes in the ground Ricky

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
like random holes in the ground Ricky
just<00:01:31.170> fall<00:01:31.409> through<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> dies<00:01:31.920> its<00:01:32.250> most<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
just fall through and dies its most of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
just fall through and dies its most of
the<00:01:32.729> pass<00:01:32.939> through<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> level<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.500> way

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the pass through the level are one way

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140 
the pass through the level are one way
only<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.280> easy<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.670> split<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
only it's easy to get split up for the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
only it's easy to get split up for the
rest<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.509> team<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.380> also<00:01:38.009> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
rest of your team that is also very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
rest of your team that is also very
sketchy<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.720> gonna<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.960> much<00:01:40.110> more<00:01:40.259> cost<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
sketchy it's gonna be much more cost of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
sketchy it's gonna be much more cost of
phobic<00:01:40.979> than<00:01:41.130> transit<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> like

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
phobic than transit and I kind of like

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.310 
phobic than transit and I kind of like
that<00:01:42.390> though<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:42.990> smaller

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that though I do like the smaller

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
that though I do like the smaller
tighter<00:01:43.950> Maps<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.640> having<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> run

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tighter Maps then having to have a run

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
tighter Maps then having to have a run
around<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> fog<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.829> run<00:01:47.310> freaking

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
around all in the fog and run freaking

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.980 
around all in the fog and run freaking
forever<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.930> to

go to get jug or something like that so
it's<00:01:50.790> gonna<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.030> more<00:01:51.149> vertical<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:51.720> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it's gonna be more vertical which is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
it's gonna be more vertical which is
cool<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:53.100> far<00:01:53.430> too<00:01:53.460> easy<00:01:53.640> to
