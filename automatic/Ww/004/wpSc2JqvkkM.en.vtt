really bored and I felt like doing

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460 
really bored and I felt like doing
random<00:01:20.220> shit<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.810> because<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> kill

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
random shit and because this was a kill

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.370 
random shit and because this was a kill
figured<00:01:23.250> I'd<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.640> Elmo<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.299> anyways<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.350> yeah

figured I'd see Elmo it anyways so yeah

so<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.189> seriousness<00:01:26.220> though<00:01:27.000> um<00:01:27.360> why<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so in all seriousness though um why I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 
so in all seriousness though um why I
think<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> kap-40<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> overpowered<00:01:30.060> weapon

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
think the kap-40 is a overpowered weapon

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.749 
think the kap-40 is a overpowered weapon
now<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.680> tend<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> lot

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
now as you can see I tend to get a lot

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
now as you can see I tend to get a lot
of<00:01:32.820> kills<00:01:33.180> farther<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:35.100> you

it's not that hard to get kills and I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.800 
it's not that hard to get kills and I
feel<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.900> gun<00:01:40.229> shouldn't<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> classified<00:01:41.549> a

not really special gun but a submachine

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
not really special gun but a submachine
gun<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.939> opinion<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.950> mainly<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
gun in my opinion and mainly just

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.520 
gun in my opinion and mainly just
because<00:01:53.159> how<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> reacts<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
because how it reacts and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.820 
because how it reacts and
facts<00:01:55.190> even<00:01:55.880> on<00:01:56.090> some<00:01:56.420> submachine<00:01:57.049> guns<00:01:57.470> you

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
facts even on some submachine guns you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.760 
facts even on some submachine guns you
get<00:01:58.010> even<00:01:58.310> less<00:01:58.490> quality<00:01:59.210> over<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.049> kap-40<00:02:00.619> if

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
get even less quality over the kap-40 if

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.140 
get even less quality over the kap-40 if
you<00:02:00.830> know<00:02:00.920> what<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.100> mean<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.000> don't

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
think the kap-40 is overpowered weapon I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.750 
think the kap-40 is overpowered weapon I
don't<00:02:33.739> know<00:02:33.800> if<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.100> correct<00:02:34.340> me<00:02:34.550> if<00:02:34.610> I'm

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
wrong or anything but maybe is there

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
wrong or anything but maybe is there
going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> be<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.800> patch<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.400> haven't<00:02:38.090> seen

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
going to be a patch I haven't seen

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
going to be a patch I haven't seen
anybody<00:02:38.690> else<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> video<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.500> how<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.310> a

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
anybody else do a video on how this is a

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.509 
anybody else do a video on how this is a
horrid<00:02:40.870> weapon<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.500> don't<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.430> if

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
horrid weapon but I don't know if

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.949 
horrid weapon but I don't know if
there's<00:02:43.700> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.030> patch<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:44.480> something

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
there's going to be a patch or something

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.710 
there's going to be a patch or something
to<00:02:45.440> decrease<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> amount<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.120> power<00:02:47.480> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
to decrease it the amount of power it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.020 
to decrease it the amount of power it
has<00:02:47.870> because<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> really<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:49.670> just

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
has because it really is it's just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.750 
has because it really is it's just
really<00:02:50.360> good<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.260> only<00:02:51.650> issue<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.130> find<00:02:52.610> with

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
really good the only issue I find with

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.970 
really good the only issue I find with
it<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.209> make<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.450> less<00:02:53.930> overpowered<00:02:54.709> it's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it to make it less overpowered it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.009 
it to make it less overpowered it's
similar<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.000> executioner<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.870> guys

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
similar to the executioner if you guys

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.539 
similar to the executioner if you guys
know<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.410> that's<00:02:57.650> overpowered<00:02:58.130> because<00:02:58.400> it's

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
know how that's overpowered because it's

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.729 
know how that's overpowered because it's
like<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> little<00:02:59.209> shotgun<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.620> sort

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
like a little shotgun and you can sort

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.289 
like a little shotgun and you can sort
of<00:03:00.890> carry<00:03:01.070> two<00:03:01.310> shotguns<00:03:01.820> around<00:03:02.150> without

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
of carry two shotguns around without

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.720 
of carry two shotguns around without
having<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.890> what's<00:03:04.400> called<00:03:04.459> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
having the the what's called the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.000 
having the the what's called the
overkill<00:03:05.269> perk<00:03:05.829> basically<00:03:06.829> what<00:03:06.980> I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
overkill perk basically what I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.710 
overkill perk basically what I
personally<00:03:07.579> think<00:03:07.760> with<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.090> weapon<00:03:08.360> here

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
personally think with this weapon here

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
personally think with this weapon here
is<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.410> similar<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.100> executioner<00:03:10.790> where's

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
is it similar to the executioner where's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.759 
is it similar to the executioner where's
it's<00:03:11.209> really<00:03:11.540> overpowered<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.260> weapons

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
it's really overpowered with weapons

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.610 
it's really overpowered with weapons
strength<00:03:13.250> not<00:03:14.060> length<00:03:14.480> well<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.959> mean<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.440> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
strength not length well I mean this is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.740 
strength not length well I mean this is
a<00:03:15.650> lot<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.610> get<00:03:16.760> hit<00:03:16.940> markers<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.420> shots

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
a lot you can get hit markers and shots

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.310 
a lot you can get hit markers and shots
a<00:03:17.959> lot<00:03:18.019> longer<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.310> can<00:03:19.430> see<00:03:19.670> enum<00:03:20.320> thing

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
a lot longer as you can see enum thing

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.020 
a lot longer as you can see enum thing
you<00:03:21.470> can<00:03:21.650> see<00:03:21.890> pretty<00:03:22.430> soon<00:03:22.730> because<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:22.970> do

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
you can see pretty soon because I do

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.110 
you can see pretty soon because I do
switch<00:03:23.359> over<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.959> other<00:03:24.140> class<00:03:25.120> these

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
switch over to the other class these
