00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.240 
stick your paper in there and crimp it
you<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:35.720> squeeze<00:02:36.720> down<00:02:36.990> on<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.590> then

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you would squeeze down on it and then

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.140 
you would squeeze down on it and then
you<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:39.560> run<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.710> through<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.000> give

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you just run it through there and give

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.220 
you just run it through there and give
it<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.540> poor<00:02:43.350> negated<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.960> would<00:02:46.140> look

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it that poor negated it would look

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.350 
it that poor negated it would look
really<00:02:46.290> cool<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
really cool to like if it was like a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 
really cool to like if it was like a
metallic<00:02:48.750> silver<00:02:49.380> paper<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.980> could<00:02:50.100> look<00:02:50.280> like

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
metallic silver paper it could look like

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.840 
metallic silver paper it could look like
corrugated<00:02:50.970> metal<00:02:51.410> anyway<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.550> kind<00:02:53.790> of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
corrugated metal anyway this is kind of

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.830 
corrugated metal anyway this is kind of
like<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> corrugated<00:02:54.990> cardboard<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.540> I'm

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
like a corrugated cardboard look so I'm

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.960 
like a corrugated cardboard look so I'm
going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.800> ahead<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.040> started<00:02:59.640> hearing

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
going to go ahead and started hearing

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.390 
going to go ahead and started hearing
some<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.450> down<00:03:00.630> not<00:03:01.380> sure<00:03:01.410> exactly<00:03:02.100> where

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
some of this down not sure exactly where

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
some of this down not sure exactly where
I'm<00:03:02.490> going<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:04.040> vague<00:03:05.040> idea

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
I'm going with this I have a vague idea

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.160 
I'm going with this I have a vague idea
but<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.270> set<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.840> stone<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:09.660> never<00:03:09.900> is

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
but it's not set in stone it never is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.080 
but it's not set in stone it never is
set<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.590> stone<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:11.250> there's<00:03:11.520> always<00:03:11.850> room

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
set in stone right there's always room

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.270 
set in stone right there's always room
for<00:03:12.890> there's<00:03:13.890> always<00:03:14.250> wiggle<00:03:14.580> room<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:16.350> I'm

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
for there's always wiggle room so I'm

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.300 
for there's always wiggle room so I'm
doing<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.510> slightly<00:03:18.959> more<00:03:19.530> towards<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
doing this slightly more towards the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.670 
doing this slightly more towards the
bottom<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.850> am<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.090> top<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.690> card<00:03:22.500> by

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
bottom that I am the top this card by

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.850 
bottom that I am the top this card by
the<00:03:22.709> way<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.040> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.280> open<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:24.860> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the way is going to open like this and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.770 
the way is going to open like this and
I'm<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.350> adhere<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:30.120> top<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.660> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
I'm going to adhere this on top of that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.400 
I'm going to adhere this on top of that
and<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:36.120> remember<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:37.580> textured<00:03:38.580> papers

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
and just remember that textured papers

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.820 
and just remember that textured papers
sometimes<00:03:40.410> are<00:03:40.709> harder<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.750> get<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:43.020> stick<00:03:43.320> so

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
sometimes are harder to get to stick so

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.790 
sometimes are harder to get to stick so
you<00:03:43.920> want<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.250> make<00:03:44.280> sure<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.800> put

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
you want to make sure that you put

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.460 
you want to make sure that you put
plenty<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.280> adhesive<00:03:47.910> although<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.510> don't<00:03:49.080> tend

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
plenty of adhesive although I don't tend

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.440 
plenty of adhesive although I don't tend
to<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.770> problem<00:03:50.250> as<00:03:50.610> many<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.360> you

the<00:04:39.470> way<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.680> looks<00:04:39.740> just<00:04:44.050> make<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.260> more

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the way that looks just make it a more

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.070 
the way that looks just make it a more
manageable<00:04:45.650> link<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:50.150> I'm<00:04:50.480> going<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.690> take<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
manageable link so I'm going to take the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.540 
manageable link so I'm going to take the
modern<00:04:51.470> label<00:04:51.860> pinch<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:53.020> pinch<00:04:54.020> out<00:04:55.060> three

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
modern label pinch and pinch out three

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:06.040 
modern label pinch and pinch out three
of<00:04:58.550> these<00:05:03.970> ok<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.030> i<00:05:05.240> have<00:05:05.270> three<00:05:05.630> of<00:05:05.720> those<00:05:05.840> in
