00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
&gt;&gt; The story of 2010/2011 season of Beram Kayal in Celtic can be told from the end

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Fans' player of the Year, That was the Skipper for one game was injured twice during the season

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Between all of that he managed to impress Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish and to be Neil Lennon's Favorite 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You can almost forget the loss of The Championship to rangers And the statement from the beginning of the season: "I am not going to be a player for practice"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Music]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Applause]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;&gt; My first game in the Europea league game and I Am in the starting lineup in Celtic Park.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It gave me Shivers, 60,000 spectators.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In the Second minute I Tackled good and I saw Neil Lennon is cheering me. It started here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
&gt;&gt; I didn't like going to school, I waited it to be 10:30 to go to practice

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
&gt;&gt; At least he was drawing well

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
&gt;&gt;The transition from Maccabi Haifa to Celtic was not easy.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Number of rounds before the end the season Kayal had to undergo surgery. His team didn't look as good as it was and the team lost the championship.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Some of the fans did not like that and did 1+1 when Kayal moved to Celtic

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
&gt;&gt;The club, Maccabi Haifa, is very dear to me and I love it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Sometimes the media are trying to harm.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I went to the doctor who said it was Clear Hernia. If the doctor says that, so what more do you need to do?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
To say I'm sorry to bag for forgiveness? I didn't do anything wrong and I gave my all to this club in years.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I went to Elisha Levi and told him that I have a good offer in progress.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:43.000
My progress is also the progress of the club. I was happy Maccabi Haifa took the championship this year. I would be happier if they took the Double.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
&gt;&gt; Not long after starting the season and the good momentum, Kayal undergo another groin surgery

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately after a few games I was injured and Couldn't continue, I started the season in an amazing way and had bad luck.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The Biggest thing I took was my come back in January, Which was a good thing to me

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
&gt;&gt; The sympathy among Celtic fans started to get momentum. 'Even spider man and Superman read comic books of Beram Kayal'

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
was written in one fans forum, This sentence encouraged more like: 'Kayal does not shave he just look in the mirror and tell the bird to fall'.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He just needed one thing- First Goal

00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:10.000
&gt;&gt; [Broadcasting The Goals]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
&gt;&gt; Look at the manager how happy he is

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:27.000
&gt;&gt; In That game the captain  was suspended. The manager comes out and tells me 'Beram, You are the captain'.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It was amazing. I had gooseflesh.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
After the game against the Rangers someone from the management came and told me

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
'Sir Alex Ferguson complimented you and said you are the leader of Celtic in the middle'.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That's what made me happy, more than what the press said, because I was so sure he was talking and I was very flattered.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
&gt;&gt; 0:0 draw in the last Old Firm of the season put Celtic in the driver seat.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Five games before the end of the season Celtic and rangers started the fight. Neill Lennon's boys Stumbled.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
&gt;&gt; I was Injured and finished the season, we also lost the championship. This day is a black day for me.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
In the locker room the manager asked what we feel and then he said something very true.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
He said we are a new team and that he saw that everyone contributed. That's where we want to start next season.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We finished in a good taste and hunger for more. From that point it will continue. There will be more.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
&gt;&gt; Whoooo. What a sweet victory. You think you can beat me at home? In Celtic park someone takes points?
