didn't continue building the house which
makes<00:03:53.590> no<00:03:53.799> sense<00:03:54.040> why<00:03:54.220> would<00:03:54.430> they<00:03:54.549> give<00:03:54.729> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
makes no sense why would they give a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.199 
makes no sense why would they give a
shit<00:03:54.849> if<00:03:55.000> she<00:03:55.209> built<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.510> house<00:03:55.629> or<00:03:55.870> not<00:03:56.040> and
