we<00:00:04.770> didn't<00:00:05.040> actually<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:05.700> gonna

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
we didn't actually think it was gonna

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.940 
we didn't actually think it was gonna
happen<00:00:06.000> until<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.870> day<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.200> came<00:00:07.379> riding<00:00:07.620> by

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and we saw just like little mounds of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.470 
and we saw just like little mounds of
dirt<00:00:09.840> dug<00:00:10.110> up<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.500> really<00:00:10.679> Park<00:00:11.550> then<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.330> came

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
dirt dug up and really Park then we came

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.089 
dirt dug up and really Park then we came
by<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> week<00:00:12.929> later<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> sure<00:00:13.559> enough<00:00:13.590> they

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
by a week later and sure enough they

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.090 
by a week later and sure enough they
were<00:00:14.130> building<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.839> also<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
were building it so it was also that the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.689 
were building it so it was also that the
weight<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.699> fast<00:00:25.279> as<00:00:26.279> far<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> goes

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
weight was really fast as far as it goes

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
weight was really fast as far as it goes
like<00:00:27.090> there's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> lot<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> flow<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> park

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
like there's a lot of flow to the park

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
like there's a lot of flow to the park
and<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> lot<00:00:29.369> more<00:00:29.550> space<00:00:29.789> than<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and there's a lot more space than the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.669 
and there's a lot more space than the
other<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> lot<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.500> features

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
other one so there's a lot more features

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
other one so there's a lot more features
to<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.510> get<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.630> riding<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
to actually get your riding in and not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
to actually get your riding in and not
just<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.950> snaked<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.670> everybody<00:00:36.090> else<00:00:36.149> I

just get snaked out by everybody else I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.729 
just get snaked out by everybody else I
really<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> fact<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> they

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
really like the fact that they

really like the fact that they
incorporated<00:00:38.340> more<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> plaza<00:00:39.030> feature

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

with it the stair sets the hubbas and
the<00:00:41.700> ledges<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:44.010> have

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the ledges just because it's a we have

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
the ledges just because it's a we have

corporated<00:00:54.360> Street<00:00:54.600> features<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.110> keep

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
corporated Street features that keep

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770 
corporated Street features that keep
kids<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.520> from<00:00:56.730> bugging<00:00:56.910> businesses<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> the

kids but from bugging businesses in the
town<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> fact

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
town you know so I really like the fact

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
town you know so I really like the fact
that<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.210> put<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.840> stair<00:01:01.140> set<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that they put this stair set in the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.139 
that they put this stair set in the
whole<00:01:01.829> street<00:01:02.129> section<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> all

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
whole street section just kind of all

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
whole street section just kind of all
close<00:01:03.390> together<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
close together and then they put the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
close together and then they put the
Taurani<00:01:04.739> training<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> outside<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
Taurani training on the outside of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
Taurani training on the outside of the
park<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.500> creates<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:08.070> nice<00:01:08.280> flow<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
park so it just creates one nice flow of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
park so it just creates one nice flow of
a<00:01:08.820> part<00:01:09.119> first<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.500> old<00:01:10.710> one

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
a part first is just like the old one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469 
a part first is just like the old one
that<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.220> goes<00:01:11.400> around<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> circle<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that just goes around in a circle and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
that just goes around in a circle and
it's<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:13.110> lap<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> over

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it's just the same lap over and over

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
it's just the same lap over and over
again<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.640> pretty<00:01:15.299> much<00:01:15.479> endless

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
again it's just pretty much endless

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.890 
again it's just pretty much endless
possibilities<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.710> far<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.509> honestly<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> have

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
possibilities so far I honestly I have

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.010 
possibilities so far I honestly I have
never<00:01:19.259> seen<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:20.490> 75%<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> people<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
never seen about 75% of the people that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
never seen about 75% of the people that
come<00:01:22.170> skate<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
come skate here and I think that just

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.870 
come skate here and I think that just
shows<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.619> skatepark<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.580> brought

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
shows how much the skatepark has brought

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
shows how much the skatepark has brought
people<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.470> impact<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
people out and it has that impact on

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.969 
people out and it has that impact on
people<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> come<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.200> come<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> skate

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
people to come out and come to the skate

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
people to come out and come to the skate
park<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.880> these<00:01:33.119> things<00:01:33.420> rather<00:01:33.869> than

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
park and do these things rather than

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
park and do these things rather than
just<00:01:34.500> go<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.950> old<00:01:35.070> blown-out<00:01:35.369> skate<00:01:35.820> park

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just go to an old blown-out skate park

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
just go to an old blown-out skate park
but<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.979> more

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but just you know it's gonna get more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
but just you know it's gonna get more
ruined<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> hurt

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
ruined and you're just gonna go hurt

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.109 
ruined and you're just gonna go hurt
yourself<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.400> can't<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.909> your

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
yourself because you can't you know your
