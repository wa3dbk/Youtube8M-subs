00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.980
 half-life finally old men 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.500
 I meant retiro sleep with the best channel 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 games heard your requests and made 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 release about this game so 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 let's not hesitate and without further ado 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.609
 let's start to reveal the incredible 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.609
 and an interesting half-life story 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.040
 and instead of the splash screen, I’m saying that we don’t 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.239
 get half-life 3 we get only 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.010
 big fat dick and so in my year 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.960
 birth is not yet born 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.559
 thundered all over the world and company 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.659
 valve 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.850
 it was created by two people from 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.649
 microsoft and michael harrington 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.190
 of which of course no one knows 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.620
 geyby newell fat old man enough 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.509
 make games that make in any 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.610
 case these two guys are having seen 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:04.330
 serials secret materials and beyond 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.939
 the possible 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.430
 as well as having read steven king 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.360
 comes up with a half-life game 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.030
 sci-fi story about how 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.890
 due to an unsuccessful experiment in our world 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.939
 through only spatial portal 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.640
 snuck in 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.710
 aliens and close it can only 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.850
 one person person whose name 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.860
 gordon freeman 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.560
 can 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.750
 why did I take this photo anyway you 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.840
 play as a very silent engineer 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.700
 a scientist who implicitly follows 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 all the instruction that gets in the course 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.480
 games 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.180
 little son about thinking with his head 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.370
 although maybe it's good for the whole game 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.510
 he doesn't say a word because n knows what 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.510
 lurking in his mind 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.990
 in fact, I’ll have enough fun 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.540
 this masterpiece so prepare your 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.280
 farts to seriousness tacit right 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.640
 on and constant monitoring of everything from 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.050
 first person is thoughtful 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.570
 psychological inducing force 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.370
 player feel part of the plot and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.300
 hold a bunch of free games 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.360
 of time 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.860
 bite the job guys i want you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 warn that we won't disassemble 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.220
 each half-life part separately we 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.080
 let's talk only about its features and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 individual characters since if we 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.310
 let's start discussing each half-life series 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.620
 but just the way I want it will take 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.769
 about an hour maybe even shorter 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.380
 continue half-life and no quests as 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.239
 open world well, like all locations 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.880
 connected but to go to the next 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.709
 need to wait out the download open world 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 just does not allow the engine itself 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.330
 By the way about him the engine was bought and a little 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.510
 converted from popular at that time 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.040
 games quake what is there with me now 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.989
 pleasure for hacked if you then 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.850
 gone but we are talking about half-life and 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.650
 single nonlinear moment 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.510
 is the ending of the game where we 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.700
 have to choose either to obey 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.560
 jim well either return to zen 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.780
 alien world in which we are waiting for only 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.450
 death push ups we'll talk separately 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.170
 like the most mysterious and it seems the most 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.900
 meaningful characters of the half-life universe 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.880
 and here is an interesting fact of the game portal series 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.280
 takes place in the same universe that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.599
 half-life games 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.970
 the only thing is unclear which ones 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.040
 time intervals occur action 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.380
 in both games because at the beginning of the second 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.910
 half-life we find out that we were frozen 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 several decades and at the beginning 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.319
 the second portal find out what were 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.540
 already conserved for several hundred years 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.489
 I looked for a bit and found what I found in 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.410
 the end of the first portal when strokes sing 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.840
 song on credits by about the second 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.670
 minute go the next words go away and 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.860
 leave me i think i would prefer 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.720
 stay inside maybe you will find 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.510
 someone else will help you 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.760
 may be merci and ellipsis in the same 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.830
 moment down on the left of the screen 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.030
 numbers and characters drawn symbol 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.799
 black mesa back to our topic in 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.290
 the second half-life and the plot took just 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.750
 awesome momentum and I speak immediately to 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.519
 all created episodes of course to 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.830
 make this release I played in each 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.440
 of them and I will say right away what is huge 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.630
 amount of plot information is simply not 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.459
 It will turn out to be a spoiler for 1 release 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.970
 so we'll talk about parts 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.430
 games 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.160
 and specifically about a character named Jane 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.990
 in fact his name is unknown 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.050
 the fact that in America so called man 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.760
 from the city government like gym and 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.080
 passing half-life you probably noticed 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.510
 that this neatly dressed man 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.220
 quite often watching you and at the end he 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.110
 says you did everything right 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.250
 further it appears in all true 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.720
 half-life parts 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.180
 and increasingly start on you 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.010
 work if at first he says 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.990
 that he has a tenant and that 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.669
 subsequent passage jimin gives 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.039
 understand that now he has appeared 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.720
 personal interests are known only 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.090
 the following abilities are jim na 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.680
 he can put stasis this state 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.020
 similar frosts but somewhere in there 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.090
 less outside space can not be 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.340
 killed by ordinary weapons and can 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.020
 can move in space by some 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.630
 way to influence people's minds 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.630
 and also stop the events in need him 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.130
 moment but he also has weaknesses because 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.259
 the game has a moment when the Vortigonts 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.539
 appears in purple irradiation and 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.610
 rescues freeman from under the action of jim n 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.020
 and also there are moments where jim and himself 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.120
 says he ca n't watch 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.789
 Freeman as much as he would like 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.979
 and that he has limitations and here's another 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.840
 interesting thing in the last one released 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.060
 addition to portal 2 can stumble 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.009
 on this picture in person 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.169
 costume this is cave johnson founder 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.400
 apertures but honestly whom he to you on 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.130
 really reminds 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.380
 seems to be somewhere here and the connection is groped 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.180
 portal with half-life but very, very 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.280
 dimly and in general I prepare for release 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.930
 I read so many crazy theories that 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.180
 I had a thought to create more 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.759
 one program but more on that later, what about 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.009
 half-life 3 then looked through and read 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.599
 and all interviews with geyb newwell we 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.919
 we see that he constantly evades 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.750
 questions about this game 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.280
 if in one interview valve is diligent 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.780
 half life of the busy in another 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.190
 interview they say more importantly 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.810
 develop a new engine 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.699
 no one at the moment 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.370
 can say for sure when it comes out 3 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.470
 half-life and whether it ever came out 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.180
 so hackneyed theme that mom is 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.090
 Internet is no longer counted 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.599
 so we only have husband and ca 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.470
 wait and search for news on the Internet 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:33.820
 spending more time behind the monitor 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.820
 without getting up from the computer 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.560
 auto fat dick and that's it as always 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.820
 maximum information minimum time 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.440
 thanks for watching friends put
