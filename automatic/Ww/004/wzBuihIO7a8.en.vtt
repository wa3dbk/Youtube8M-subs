 these that are like a witches style 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.780
 you can not negotiate with them if you give them 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.909
 emerald 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.909
 to a tree 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's go up and show what I 've 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 done and what the mod is about 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 will be 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.830
 remember the frankenstein movies 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.830
 Well, this movie will come true here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.740
 with this mode you can create 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.060
 different types of mod joined by this 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.550
 what is a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 sombrei keeper spider and this one um 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.270
 Kripper skeleton zombie spiders or 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.159
 I want to call you 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 we have modified their genes so that 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.700
 remain so 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.500
 you will say how do I do this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 when you believe is this machine that I know 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 thus 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460
 do not have to do 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.300
 good 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.960
 do not have to do or take them out of the way 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.780
 creative 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.230
 these are the items that bring brings a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.480
 heart 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 this is a very cool base 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.650
 Well, you can protect yourself with it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.310
 and stabbing 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 there is a great 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.319
 this book I do not know what it will be 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.409
 doing 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.360
 they have no function 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.870
 brings a brain lungs the altar 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.319
 blood portion of position of I do not know 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.170
 I think it's a needle and a face click 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.100
 now they will say they will simply be there in 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.060
 the bed is not 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.060
 for rain water 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.330
 and we will need to put this here 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.709
 if I'm not wrong 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.180
 and at the same the other 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.760
 now what will we do to give them life 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.520
 then we hit the shift and click 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.520
 right here and our mod will be created 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.990
 then it will close that you have created 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.250
 they are very cool they look good they look good 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.250
 if they attack you I think so 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.270
 so that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.540
 not because they did not appear in all the 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.540
 little corner 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.709
 low 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.460
 In short, that is the way he likes the most 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.560
 this gadget 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.020
 I do not know what function it has 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.300
 how is a beta the way to percent 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.630
 you need the main transport to be able 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.850
 pitch it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.310
 it seems to me that the fort mantra is a very 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.969
 good application for mods makes them 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.360
 that did not grow in almost 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.269
 and this has been the review of the way 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.829
 now we move on to the good installation already 

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:53.159
 we are here in the installation first 

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:57.409
 that everything will install the minecraft force 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:00.949
 we will go to home r think all windows 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:03.900
 and we put an app data percentage 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.729
 percentage to accept 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.310
 to send each roaming as always 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:13.430
 let's go to minecraft to bing 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.970
 and here also incredible we will open with 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.970
 winrar 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.550
 now we minimize this we put 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.210
 ancash force 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.350
 we have here 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.150
 around here and all this to delete the folder 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.800
 metallicity you have not forget is always 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.800
 the overflow if it will not crash 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.040
 from fuck to minecraft 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.170
 select any file of the 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.550
 controlled as always and 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.630
 preferably down so you do not 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.820
 put some folder and we play everything 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.010
 we wait to accept the story that 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.650
 seen the force marks now so that 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.660
 create your micro force folders open 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.590
 the minecraft 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.000
 and we enter and will load here a little something 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.700
 it has to be to fill it all up for 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.120
 that you create the folders in the letter 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.920
 also a minecraft point we close the 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.880
 in grace now we take the folder of 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.780
 mod 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.289
 in this case mansi black and we're going to cut 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.719
 or copy let's go here 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.270
 we go backwards we will have to create a 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.719
 folder called mod here we have the 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.719
 binder 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.009
 now we go to look if it was 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.009
 installed 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.840
