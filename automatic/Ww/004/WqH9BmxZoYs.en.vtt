00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:09.640
 I thought I was tired. 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.289
 Can't wave again 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.564
 Wings without goals 

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:16.088
 I tried to fly over the window 

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:17.713
 Temperature makes the body 

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:19.741
 Feeling frustrated again 

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.266
 I smile is not pretending 

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.899
 I chase because of desire 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.354
 I am rushing to the body 

00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:26.103
 Every sunshine 

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:27.729
 I fell and grew up. 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.106
 I cry is a release 

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:30.647
 I exist is not an illusion 

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:32.558
 I don't care if I am stubborn 

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.145
 Craving for love 

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:35.685
 Suffered a bit of injury 

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:37.249
 To protect my faith 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.114
 Become stronger 

00:01:39.114 --> 00:01:40.600
 Rampage for obstinacy 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.195
 Tell you a lie 

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:45.306
 Don't say I have been unable to find directions. 

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.746
 Give crazy to love again 

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:48.603
 Suffered a bit of injury 

00:01:48.603 --> 00:01:50.182
 To protect my faith 

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:51.808
 Become stronger 

00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:53.309
 Rampage for obstinacy 

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:54.888
 Tell you a lie 

00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:57.055
 Looking at others, I disdain 

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:00.949
 Flying forward 

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:47.443
 I thought I was tired. 

00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:49.161
 Can't wave again 

00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.413
 Wings without goals 

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.937
 I tried to fly over the window 

00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:55.516
 The temperature makes the body feel depressed again 

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:57.559
 I smile is not pretending 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.076
 I chase because of desire 

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:00.655

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:02.234
 I am rushing to the body 

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:04.022
 Every sunshine 

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:05.577
 I fell and grew up. 

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:06.808
 I cry is a release 

00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:08.433
 I exist is not an illusion 

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:11.011
 I don't care if I am stubborn 

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:13.542
 Craving for love 

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:15.121
 Suffered a bit of injury 

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.614
 To protect my faith 

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.310
 Become stronger 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.912
 Rampage for obstinacy 

00:03:19.912 --> 00:03:21.483
 Tell you a lie 

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:24.595
 Don't say I have been unable to find directions. 

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.320
 Give crazy to love again 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.969

00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:39.982
 Flying forward 

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:45.533
 Craving for love 

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:47.073
 Suffered a bit of injury 

00:03:47.073 --> 00:03:48.722

 Looking at others, I disdain 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.515
 Flying forward
