00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
as if you're going against a much

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
as if you're going against a much
stronger<00:00:39.420> defender<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.200> much<00:00:40.379> longer<00:00:40.800> arms

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
stronger defender with much longer arms

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.930 
stronger defender with much longer arms
how's<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> sound<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.899> me<00:00:43.940> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
how's that sound can you do it for me so

how's that sound can you do it for me so
that's<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> way<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> works<00:00:46.140> with

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that's the kind of the way it works with

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.340 
that's the kind of the way it works with
training<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> definite<00:00:48.149> good<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.200> do

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
training is a definite good thing to do

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
training is a definite good thing to do
because<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.870> not<00:00:52.140> only<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> train<00:00:53.600> game

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
because you not only want to train game

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
because you not only want to train game
like<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> harder<00:00:56.820> than

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
like you want to make it harder than

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
like you want to make it harder than
again<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> gay<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.469> be

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
again you want to go to a gay and be

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
again you want to go to a gay and be
like<00:00:58.829> oh<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> easier<00:00:59.730> than<00:00:59.789> practice<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
like oh this is easier than practice is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
like oh this is easier than practice is
easy<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.820> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.239> right<00:01:03.510> before

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
easy so if you do this right before

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
easy so if you do this right before
playing<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> game<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.220> did

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
playing in a game which is what we did

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
playing in a game which is what we did
it's<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.119> much<00:01:06.299> easier<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.750> finish<00:01:07.049> with

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it's just much easier to finish with

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
it's just much easier to finish with
contacts<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:08.970> getting

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
contacts because you're not getting

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
contacts because you're not getting
attacked<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.830> defender<00:01:11.280> nearly<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.670> hard

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
attacked by your defender nearly as hard

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
attacked by your defender nearly as hard
there<00:01:12.420> defender<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:13.229> arms<00:01:13.680> aren't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
there defender other arms aren't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.609 
there defender other arms aren't
actually<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.670> long<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> kickboard

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
actually as long as with the kickboard

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.850 
actually as long as with the kickboard
so<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.280> super<00:01:17.549> useful<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.799> who<00:01:19.799> do

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so it's really super useful so who do

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.990 
so it's really super useful so who do
you<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.210> 10<00:01:21.290> 12<00:01:22.290> repetitions<00:01:22.680> each<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
you like 10 12 repetitions each I don't

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490 
you like 10 12 repetitions each I don't
really<00:01:24.180> keep<00:01:24.360> count<00:01:24.689> whatever<00:01:25.020> feels<00:01:25.320> good

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
really keep count whatever feels good

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
really keep count whatever feels good
whatever<00:01:25.950> makes<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> tired<00:01:26.659> always<00:01:27.659> ending

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
whatever makes you tired always ending

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
whatever makes you tired always ending
on<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.409> any<00:01:28.829> wanna<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.340> super<00:01:29.790> important

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
on a make any wanna make super important

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200 
on a make any wanna make super important
for<00:01:30.799> confidence<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.220> learning<00:01:32.610> it's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
for confidence and for learning it's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
for confidence and for learning it's
always<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> hand<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> Mac<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:34.560> matter<00:01:34.710> how

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
always got a hand on a Mac no matter how

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
always got a hand on a Mac no matter how
many<00:01:34.979> times<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> takes<00:01:35.430> although<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> isn't

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
many times it takes although this isn't

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
many times it takes although this isn't
necessarily<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.590> hardest<00:01:38.549> thing<00:01:38.790> because

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
necessarily the hardest thing because

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.719 
necessarily the hardest thing because
there<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.479> labs<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.229> even<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> context

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there are labs and even with the context

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
there are labs and even with the context
it's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.899> every<00:01:43.049> time<00:01:43.350> but

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's not going to go in every time but

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's not going to go in every time but
it<00:01:43.680> should<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> high<00:01:44.130> percentage<00:01:44.340> shot<00:01:45.140> but

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it should be a high percentage shot but

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
it should be a high percentage shot but
these<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> trick<00:01:47.250> practicing

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
these are really a trick practicing

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.710 
these are really a trick practicing
grant<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> ones<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:51.600> your

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
a lot of generating the force against

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.680 
a lot of generating the force against
the<00:03:01.380> push<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:02.220> control<00:03:03.120> your<00:03:03.240> way<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.570> way

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
to the hoop so we switched it up at this

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.670 
to the hoop so we switched it up at this
point<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.880> my<00:03:09.090> turn<00:03:09.650> phil<00:03:10.650> was

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
