00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
does require a little breaking in so

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.099 
does require a little breaking in so
you'll<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.910> lift<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.239> over<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.750> little<00:03:34.930> bit

this one uses a similar style sort of
like<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.330> bow<00:04:38.450> magic<00:04:38.840> series<00:04:39.610> where<00:04:40.610> it

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
like the you bow magic series where it

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.810 
like the you bow magic series where it
stands<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:43.130> you've<00:04:43.310> got<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.790> know

stands like this so you've got you know
three<00:04:44.120> notches<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:45.230> two<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.220> three<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.240> you

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
three notches one two and three so you

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.700 
three notches one two and three so you
know<00:04:47.570> cup<00:04:47.750> three<00:04:47.960> different<00:04:48.200> levels<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.590> how

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.870 
know cup three different levels of how
you<00:04:48.770> want<00:04:48.920> to<00:04:49.010> set<00:04:49.160> in<00:04:49.310> actually<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:49.730> know<00:04:49.820> you

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
common questions that I get quite a bit

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.570 
common questions that I get quite a bit
when<00:05:36.660> reviewing<00:05:37.020> cases<00:05:37.230> so<00:05:37.710> I'll<00:05:38.160> go<00:05:38.370> through

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
when reviewing cases so I'll go through

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.720 
when reviewing cases so I'll go through
a<00:05:38.640> few<00:05:38.880> of<00:05:38.910> those<00:05:39.830> for<00:05:40.830> this<00:05:40.950> case<00:05:41.160> I<00:05:41.370> really

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
a few of those for this case I really

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.460 
a few of those for this case I really
doubt<00:05:41.850> first<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.450> all<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:42.720> it<00:05:42.840> would<00:05:42.960> fit<00:05:43.200> in

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
doubt first of all that it would fit in

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.010 
doubt first of all that it would fit in
the<00:05:44.220> shell<00:05:44.460> hit<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:44.760> shell<00:05:44.970> part<00:05:45.180> here<00:05:45.330> with

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
the shell hit the shell part here with

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.100 
the shell hit the shell part here with
kind<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:46.530> know<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.650> body<00:05:47.900> protector<00:05:48.900> on<00:05:49.080> it

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
kind of you know a body protector on it

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.760 
kind of you know a body protector on it
like<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.890> zagg<00:05:50.250> or<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.820> know<00:05:50.910> one<00:05:51.030> of<00:05:51.060> those<00:05:51.180> BSE

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
like a zagg or you know one of those BSE

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.750 
like a zagg or you know one of those BSE
protectors<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:52.950> really<00:05:53.400> doubt<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.550> would

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
protectors I really doubt it would

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.370 
protectors I really doubt it would
because<00:05:54.030> it's<00:05:54.180> such<00:05:54.600> a<00:05:54.630> tight<00:05:54.870> fit<00:05:55.140> I<00:05:55.170> mean

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
because it's such a tight fit I mean

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.830 
because it's such a tight fit I mean
it's<00:05:55.470> got<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.590> snap<00:05:56.010> in<00:05:56.190> this<00:05:56.310> shell<00:05:56.580> so<00:05:56.850> first

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
it's got a snap in this shell so first

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.050 
it's got a snap in this shell so first
off<00:05:58.050> I<00:05:58.170> doubt<00:05:58.440> if<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:58.860> have<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.130> rear<00:05:59.490> sort<00:05:59.940> of

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
off I doubt if you have a rear sort of

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.920 
off I doubt if you have a rear sort of
protection<00:06:00.540> I<00:06:00.900> doubt<00:06:01.200> it'll<00:06:01.500> fit<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:01.710> here<00:06:02.930> too

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
protection I doubt it'll fit in here too

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.750 
protection I doubt it'll fit in here too
when<00:06:04.440> you<00:06:04.530> fold<00:06:04.830> this<00:06:05.130> all<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.460> way<00:06:05.490> back

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
when you fold this all the way back

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.020 
when you fold this all the way back
behind<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.600> iPad<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.850> magnetic<00:06:08.850> the

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
behind the iPad the magnetic the

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.940 
behind the iPad the magnetic the
magnetic<00:06:09.450> you<00:06:09.810> know<00:06:09.930> feature<00:06:10.170> does<00:06:10.440> not<00:06:10.650> turn

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
magnetic you know feature does not turn

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.550 
magnetic you know feature does not turn
off<00:06:11.100> your<00:06:11.220> display<00:06:11.610> like<00:06:11.790> some<00:06:12.000> do<00:06:12.150> and

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
off your display like some do and

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.930 
off your display like some do and
another<00:06:13.560> big<00:06:13.770> feature<00:06:13.890> people<00:06:14.280> ask<00:06:14.460> me<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.700> do

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
another big feature people ask me to do

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.760 
another big feature people ask me to do
is<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.240> show<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:15.720> what<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:15.930> looks<00:06:15.960> like<00:06:16.260> like

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
is to show you what it looks like like

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.460 
is to show you what it looks like like
that<00:06:17.010> so<00:06:17.760> as<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.300> can<00:06:18.390> see<00:06:18.600> it<00:06:18.840> does<00:06:19.050> fold<00:06:19.290> back

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
that so as you can see it does fold back

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.470 
that so as you can see it does fold back
pretty<00:06:19.740> nicely<00:06:20.010> it<00:06:20.760> doesn't<00:06:21.060> add<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.180> whole<00:06:21.300> lot

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
pretty nicely it doesn't add a whole lot

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.120 
pretty nicely it doesn't add a whole lot
of<00:06:21.600> bulk<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.140> in<00:06:22.320> fact<00:06:22.560> I<00:06:22.710> think<00:06:22.890> it<00:06:22.950> kind<00:06:23.040> of

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
of bulk and in fact I think it kind of

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.100 
of bulk and in fact I think it kind of
adds<00:06:23.280> some<00:06:23.610> some<00:06:24.030> side<00:06:24.270> grip<00:06:24.570> on<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.840> sides

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
adds some some side grip on the sides

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.270 
adds some some side grip on the sides
here<00:06:25.380> so<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.710> can<00:06:25.800> kind<00:06:25.920> of<00:06:25.950> hold<00:06:26.040> it<00:06:26.160> like

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
here so you can kind of hold it like

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.910 
here so you can kind of hold it like
that<00:06:26.460> so<00:06:27.420> that's<00:06:27.900> not<00:06:28.050> bad<00:06:28.290> at<00:06:28.410> all<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.740> like<00:06:28.800> I

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
that so that's not bad at all and like I

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.340 
that so that's not bad at all and like I
said<00:06:28.980> see<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.460> the<00:06:29.850> funk<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:31.050> magnet

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
said see the the funk the the magnet

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.510 
said see the the funk the the magnet
doesn't<00:06:31.620> go<00:06:31.740> off<00:06:31.890> or<00:06:32.070> anything<00:06:32.250> like<00:06:32.400> that

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
doesn't go off or anything like that

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.520 
doesn't go off or anything like that
when<00:06:32.850> it's<00:06:32.970> in<00:06:33.090> that<00:06:33.150> position<00:06:33.360> I'm<00:06:33.870> extremely

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
when it's in that position I'm extremely

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.730 
when it's in that position I'm extremely
happy<00:06:35.010> with<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.570> it's<00:06:36.570> great<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.290> second

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 
protects all around the case sort of

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.409 
protects all around the case sort of
unlike<00:07:27.020> the<00:07:27.169> the<00:07:27.529> in<00:07:27.649> case<00:07:28.059> magazine<00:07:29.059> jacket<00:07:29.360> I

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
unlike the the in case magazine jacket I

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.239 
unlike the the in case magazine jacket I
did<00:07:29.569> a<00:07:29.599> review<00:07:29.869> on<00:07:29.929> how<00:07:30.259> it<00:07:30.889> kind<00:07:30.979> of<00:07:31.069> leaves

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:31.249 
did a review on how it kind of leaves

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:32.769 
did a review on how it kind of leaves
the<00:07:31.429> bottom<00:07:31.759> and<00:07:31.909> top<00:07:32.089> open<00:07:32.479> this<00:07:32.599> one

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:32.779 
the bottom and top open this one

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:34.419 
the bottom and top open this one
obviously<00:07:32.959> does<00:07:33.439> not<00:07:33.469> so<00:07:33.830> it<00:07:33.949> covers<00:07:34.159> all

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:34.429 
obviously does not so it covers all

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:37.480 
obviously does not so it covers all
bases<00:07:34.550> with<00:07:35.089> this<00:07:35.209> case<00:07:35.419> and<00:07:36.099> in<00:07:37.099> my<00:07:37.339> opinion

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
bases with this case and in my opinion

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.159 
bases with this case and in my opinion
this<00:07:38.419> I<00:07:38.659> would<00:07:39.080> not<00:07:39.259> consider<00:07:39.589> this<00:07:39.830> bulky

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
this I would not consider this bulky

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.540 
this I would not consider this bulky
there's<00:07:42.169> a<00:07:42.319> lot<00:07:42.499> more<00:07:42.529> bulkier<00:07:42.979> cases<00:07:43.399> see

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
there's a lot more bulkier cases see

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.129 
there's a lot more bulkier cases see
this<00:07:43.759> does<00:07:43.939> not<00:07:44.089> add<00:07:44.330> a<00:07:44.360> ton<00:07:44.749> of<00:07:44.779> bulk

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:45.139 
this does not add a ton of bulk

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:46.749 
this does not add a ton of bulk
