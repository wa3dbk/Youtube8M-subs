 Hi, I'm the cunning bruno I sandro 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.889
 muds 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 we see talking about our passion for 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.009
 paper and wall fabric I was created 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.919
 by day and by grandmother then is I always wanted 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.749
 a grandmother's grandmother's house knows 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.449
 the choice of the wallpaper neither here in 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.529
 started by the passion that we have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.909
 by porcelain 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.220
 we have this company collection 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:35.070
 macau that is all blue and 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.570
 white and I wanted him too 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.830
 disappear if a little in the room 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 dinner did not want him to stay 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.900
 neat stuff and everything, and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 has this wallpaper called by 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.190
 ceramics of ralph loren who married 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.650
 perfectly a dish was going to fail 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 some photo albums photos of my 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.670
 childhood 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.610
 and then I saw my birthday on my lap 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 of my sister blowing on the cake and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.320
 wall had exactly these dishes for 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 coincidence also has a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.479
 feature is the river house too. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.329
 here , they have similarities 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.899
 The bookcase is always red and 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.450
 the bedroom is the victory of 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.289
 June which is a passion between the master can 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.539
 to drive 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.219
 I think all washrooms of any house 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.770
 It has to be special, I think it has to 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.439
 have photos that have to have flower I think 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.310
 have to have some tissue paper 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.310
 more elaborate 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.790
 I'm passionate about wallpaper is 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.840
 this wallpaper is actually a 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.970
 panel 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.790
 It has medium beginning and end does not have to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.330
 repetition then it is a panel that can 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.570
 be used on a wall such as this 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.360
 perhaps one type of 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.520
 role that I love that tells a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 story with beginning middle and end is a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.800
 forest is beautiful thing in this technique 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.100
 to illustrate that they are small habits 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 that are forming the design according to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.790
 the intensity here of 161 to my room 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.790
 become a more poetic corner but it is 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.900
 Playful maybe it snows I dine nominated in the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.900
 white and black forest
