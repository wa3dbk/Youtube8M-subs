00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
some granola bars and I used to eat

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.940 
some granola bars and I used to eat
these<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.090> lot<00:02:50.510> before<00:02:50.960> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.320> put<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.620> pray

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.550 
these a lot before going to put and pray
so<00:02:52.760> because<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.420> missed<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.960> I<00:02:54.110> was<00:02:54.260> looking

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
so because I missed them I was looking

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.400 
so because I missed them I was looking
at<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.860> ingredients<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.960> they<00:02:56.960> don't<00:02:57.260> have

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
at the ingredients and they don't have

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.950 
at the ingredients and they don't have
any<00:02:57.770> gluten<00:02:58.040> ingredients<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.330> if<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.780> have

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
any gluten ingredients but if you have

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.110 
any gluten ingredients but if you have
celiac<00:03:00.410> stay<00:03:00.800> away<00:03:01.070> from<00:03:01.130> them<00:03:01.520> because<00:03:01.700> they

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
celiac stay away from them because they

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720 
celiac stay away from them because they
do<00:03:02.180> not<00:03:02.360> claim<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.230> blue<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.470> gray<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.580> they

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
do not claim to be blue and gray so they

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.880 
do not claim to be blue and gray so they
might<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.180> processed<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.020> facility<00:03:06.200> would

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
might be processed in a facility would

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.330 
might be processed in a facility would
put<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:08.030> because<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.870> not<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.830> sensitive

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
put in but because I not that sensitive

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.950 
put in but because I not that sensitive

here we're looking at the organic eggs
and<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:52.110> there's<00:03:52.319> anything<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.010> would

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and if there's anything I would

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.759 
and if there's anything I would
recommend<00:03:53.580> getting<00:03:54.000> at<00:03:54.269> costco<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:55.140> would

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
recommend getting at costco it would

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.309 
recommend getting at costco it would
definitely<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.700> organic<00:03:57.150> eggs<00:03:57.390> because<00:03:57.780> I

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
definitely be the organic eggs because I

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.130 
definitely be the organic eggs because I
feel<00:03:59.129> like<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.400> pay<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.670> lot<00:04:00.060> more<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.750> them<00:04:00.900> at

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
feel like you pay a lot more for them at

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.240 
feel like you pay a lot more for them at
other<00:04:01.620> grocery<00:04:02.310> stores<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:04.560> think<00:04:05.040> it's

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
other grocery stores and I do think it's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.370 
other grocery stores and I do think it's
important<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:05.940> organic<00:04:06.390> eggs<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.050> know<00:04:07.110> you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
important to get organic eggs I know you

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.470 
important to get organic eggs I know you
can't<00:04:07.800> eat<00:04:07.980> organic<00:04:08.550> everything<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.390> just

can't eat organic everything it's just

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.380 
can't eat organic everything it's just
impossible<00:04:10.019> with<00:04:10.650> eggs<00:04:11.010> though<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.730> chicken

impossible with eggs though and chicken

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.509 
impossible with eggs though and chicken
I<00:04:12.630> feel<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:12.989> it's<00:04:13.170> very<00:04:13.380> hormonal<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.370> it

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
I feel like it's very hormonal and it

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
I feel like it's very hormonal and it
really<00:04:14.760> makes<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.239> different<00:04:15.630> speaking<00:04:16.410> of
