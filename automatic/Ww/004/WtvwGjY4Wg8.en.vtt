00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.870
 that magnetic pass good because this 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.510
 bloom boxing of the new vivo x play 3 is 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.730
 the first mobile with screen 2 here we go 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.619
 let's see 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.750
 we already have the mobile on the table and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.689
 good for those who do not know the brand 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.869
 I live tell you that it is a mobile brand 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.759
 Chinese relatively young and good what 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.289
 bought in the allied store and together with 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.750
 the terminal sent me a small 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.130
 capacitive pencil here you have it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.130
 a zinc cutter 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.130
 and a cover for the for the terminal to 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.170
 simple sight appears of good quality already 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.800
 I will go telling experiences through 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 twitter and others 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.890
 let's start with the unboxing as 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 you see a bigger square box than 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.230
 normal and good I have a small 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 serigraphy 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.170
 in the form of circles apart from the logo 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.299
 of the terminal 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.470
 that is, each box was open because 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.990
 in theory the state 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.090
 google play and apart from them they check 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.509
 that all the accessories come before 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.930
 send the good package we already have here 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.930
 the bug 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.759
 and the truth is that in the hand for what 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 big that feels pretty pretty 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.009
 light good see you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.329
 here we have 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.570
 it is not moving 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 I have to investigate how good it is 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.040
 here we have screen protectors 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.340
 instructions and other 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.000
 and a housing for the mobile this does not 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 I expected that I 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.390
 and a good part of what we have, I have not 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.340
 said the tool for the extraction 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 from the tray or lose like that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.560
 we keep opening and good here 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 we have the power adapter that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 As you can see, it is not valid for Spain 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.959
 we have the data cable 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.500
 and we have the headphones 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 they say it sounds pretty good 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.190
 I do not think it is everything but good 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.890
 live x play tss has some measures of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.220
 15 as 8 centimeters high 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.540
 82 centimeters wide and 87 millimeters 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 of thickness all of 174 grams in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.710
 gando technical specifications has 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.250
 a 6-inch ips screen with 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.890
 resolution 2 ca and a density of 490 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.470
 pixels per inch a processor 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.080
 snapdragon 800 to 2 against written 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.350
 zeros and 3 gigs of ram a memory 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.660
 32gb internal do not expand a camera 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.900
 5- megapixel front and rear 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.200
 3 megapixels and a 3200 battery 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.200
 milliamps 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.350
 well we have the terminal on the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.510
 table and first of all I'll put next 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.230
 of g2 for example so you can see the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 difference in size 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 and on the other side I put the most 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.450
 is a bit higher than example 2 and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.140
 as you see, much bigger than the g2 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.140
 logically 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.030
 and good at the top logically 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.360
 we have the headset the sensors the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.500
 camera the vigo logo the screen and 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.980
 well below we have three buttons 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.010
 tactile kick home and menu up 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.319
 we find the jack for 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.390
 headphones left part 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.720
 the ticket for good the flag for 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.060
 micro if it's micros and eye and good down 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.659
 we find the entrance to 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 micro usb the microphone right side we 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.480
 we found the buttons to go up 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.480
 japo numen off and on 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.660
 and good in the back we found 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.730
 with the camera the flash a reader of 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.300
 Fingerprints and speakers 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.480
 up and down they say they have a chip 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.610
 dedicated by sound and it really sounds 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.360
 well it points out that it has a metal frame 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.689
 very similar to the iphone the truth to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.840
 Profile iPhone and that is that is in 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.740
 white color although in the video it seems 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.740
 silver is white 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.919
 the plastic backs 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.069
 but the truth is that it feels very 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.780
 good quality and it feels pretty 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.599
 light with the size that has the truth 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.830
 that weight is very much achieved a weight 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.750
 much like having the pro 2 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.570
 so in the next video then 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.930
 they started the comparatives and surely 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.730
 as is a little known to greg too 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.080
 also analysis exclusively of 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.660
 terminal so you can see what the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.250
 software the customization layer and 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.590
 good and the performance that it has 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.610
 basically so nothing we see in the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.610
 next astroboy video
