00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.890 
it apart I realized that I could switch
the<00:01:35.579> batteries<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.060> very<00:01:36.299> quickly<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> very

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the batteries out very quickly and very

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.450 
the batteries out very quickly and very
easily<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> comes<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
easily because it comes with a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
easily because it comes with a
pre-loaded<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.570> battery<00:01:39.930> cartridge<00:01:40.470> which

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
pre-loaded two battery cartridge which

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
pre-loaded two battery cartridge which
is<00:01:40.770> spare<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.310> comes<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.909> set<00:01:42.150> already

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
is spare it comes with one set already

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
is spare it comes with one set already
installed<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.229> ready<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.860> soon<00:01:43.950> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
installed so it's ready to go as soon as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
installed so it's ready to go as soon as
you<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.210> different<00:01:45.540> LEDs

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you get it it's got two different LEDs

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
you get it it's got two different LEDs
and<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> course<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.710> LEDs<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and of course we know that LEDs are a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340 
and of course we know that LEDs are a
lot<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.640> durable<00:01:48.030> than<00:01:48.360> incandescent<00:01:48.810> bulbs

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
lot more durable than incandescent bulbs

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
lot more durable than incandescent bulbs
we<00:01:49.799> hit<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> once<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.880> LED<00:01:51.299> comes<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.750> we

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
we hit it once and one LED comes on we

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
we hit it once and one LED comes on we
hit<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> twice<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> second<00:01:53.310> LED<00:01:53.640> comes<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
hit it twice and the second LED comes on

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
hit it twice and the second LED comes on
and<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.540> different<00:01:54.869> versions

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and there are different versions

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
and there are different versions
available<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.799> different<00:01:55.829> color<00:01:56.310> lights<00:01:56.640> as

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
available with different color lights as

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
available with different color lights as
well<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.270> hit<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.409> turns

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
well I hit it one more time and it turns

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
well I hit it one more time and it turns
off<00:01:58.829> let's<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> look<00:01:59.549> at<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.060> use

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
off let's take a look at how we can use

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.670 
off let's take a look at how we can use
this<00:02:00.479> while<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.960> duty<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.500> more

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this while we're on duty to be more

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
this while we're on duty to be more
efficient<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.310> maybe<00:02:02.700> even<00:02:02.820> safer<00:02:03.299> the
