00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.950
 [music] 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello to you danil bukkreev and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 today I want to talk about this tripod 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 it used to be very popular on the site 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.710
 aliexpress she has her merits 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.369
 their shortcomings but once they bought up 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.470
 simply 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.060
 a lot of it appeared 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 video bloggers and everyone wanted to buy 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 cheaper tripod I honestly do not remember now 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 how much did you buy it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.250
 under the video there will be a link to my order on 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.940
 snapshot can see 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.100
 but in mind about 10-12 dollars it cost 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.860
 This tripod has its merits and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 its drawbacks 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.149
 say he's just junk 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.160
 or is he just super start probably all 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.149
 of the merits 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 dignity it used to be its price 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.710
 connection with the dollar I do not even know 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 now profitable or not was its price then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.660
 all he was really cheap was his 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 the size is very compact that is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090
 fine you can carry with you if 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 somewhere you need a very easy not 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.010
 bulky super yes and in principle 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.140
 relatively and less reliable 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.450
 the publisher is less so it is reliable 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.700
 of the minuses immediately I want to note this 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 fragility 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.250
 the fact that it crumples easily breaks easily and 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.320
 all that and indeed I don’t know for sure 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.939
 this is the most and here is its height 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 maximum height of one hundred and five centimeters 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.890
 that is, if you want to shoot yourself 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
 just there is a package at the table or something 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 at a low so not high altitude 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.119
 then it is suitable for you if not then 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.650
 you can hardly take pictures of yourself 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.070
 unless of course you are small or 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.399
 do not sit there in general such cases are well here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.040
 all these things are quite reliable 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.110
 yes these are all locks they are reliable 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 nothing they never let me down 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.270
 the only thing that these legs are well and not 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.460
 very bending yes some pressure 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 or somewhere there you can pull 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.649
 really good bend and here 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.630
 see even when i fix anyway 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.490
 they are like that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.209
 hat cap and yes that is a little 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.450
 staggering with fixation of course better then 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.730
 has legs are not super reliable in the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.650
 nothing to show what else on it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.640
 I broke down in the process of seeing here 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 this regulator 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.220
 just cranking i mean we don't 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.680
 can regulate our 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.980
 pillow as we can not call it all 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.870
 this one is basically reliable reliable 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.360
 fastening is a pen by the way 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 quite securely fixes the position 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.430
 become him well i mean everything is ok so 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.430
 what else of the minuses what happened with 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.920
 With this tripod, this thing is for me. 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.340
 do not like tweet how hard I 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.470
 do it all pull well that is in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.709
 process time he stopped became 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.450
 stuck or is it possible to reduce this thing 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.730
 shifted maybe from here should 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.599
 keeps was twisting this pin 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 Well yes you can see the dent is influential 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.540
 where the tripod itself was fixed well 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.220
 Of course here, too, there is a dent that is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.650
 stupid some way of fixing that is 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.620
 he is a port and then these are jerky 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.410
 close this whole thing or this 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.750
 Here are the main shortcomings and here I am 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.299
 noticed the process of using the data 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 tripod it for example using to 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.280
 put extra light somewhere on 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.120
 Well he can put the table so 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.489
 way you that is quite low 35 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.549
 not 36 centimeters somewhere on the site 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.769
 Unknown I see that there can be direct 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.889
 the composition of something even shoot not to put 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.989
 its on the floor well, in general, we conclude 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.959
 This tripod has its merits and 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.150
 its flaws if you basically 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.500
 willing to tolerate its fragility if you don’t 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.930
 need to wear anywhere do not need to shoot 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.209
 set high on high 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.230
 the camera can then be purchased 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.090
 you will not regret yes he can not tell you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.519
 which is forever, but it serves for a while 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.049
 if you need something more reliable well 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.780
 then it is better to consider others 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.290
 the options are basically on this all i 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 told you my opinion 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.879
 And on a tripod, Kim used pretty 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.920
 I hope you liked it for a long time 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.920
 for watching up to new videos
