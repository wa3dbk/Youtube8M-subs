00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.779
 guys girls all I am with 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.000
 in need and is here we meet 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.620
 a day of mods you already know that all 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 days of the year here where you have a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.230
 marc will already be version 2.7 19.8 1.6 lo 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 that is but here I have seen you adorn and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.960
 in the channel has Kristen 's 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 reproduction with the mods for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.910
 different versions of agreement and said 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.560
 this is going to start 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.029
 good the truth that is for this mode 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.430
 you need to continue to put the sound that 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.750
 it is important and good and many more things 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.330
 that I am going to tell you now because you are going to 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.150
 to flip, as you can see, is a vote on 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.340
 villagers here I have two soldiers and I do not know 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 if you see them with their noses and what else 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.360
 is what we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.910
 enslave we are going to use them let's 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 take line but a pair of scissors and let's 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.530
 sell to soldiers and we're going to make a 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
 and we want to cut the scissors 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.940
 scissors you will treat her in the nose 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 ok and a nose you're going to take it and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.079
 let's do the same with all the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.120
 villagers agree once you have 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.309
 all the medium sized cortaditos the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.399
 noses and they can be noses 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 well look two things very simple the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.369
 first of all is to come here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.619
 and without water without having water feeling a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.750
 as the typical crop that you put with 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.219
 water to suck and do not nag no 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.409
 you need to have water in agreement is 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.539
 the hardest thing in this way and you're going to give it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 here and as you see we are going to plant 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.530
 villagers agree to also ask 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.789
 here four in four 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 today are theaters together everything that 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.899
 you want and without any problem it's worth it and not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.179
 if you see that little by little they start to 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.780
 grow villagers in our land of 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.880
 culture voucher are different as you see and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.119
 they are going to give us also a 10 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 then obviously more antennas are going to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.799
 get but if you're going to get villages 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.110
 two chalices and for and to be able to do so 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.060
 only girls this kind of village do not know 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.189
 Extracts from others without having to have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 doors and farms by leaving them then 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.479
 It's a mod that will take away that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.189
 work from above as a country go 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.720
 growing they are growing is one is a 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.520
 vanity you do not have to feed them or stay 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.460
 made they just grow and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.350
 order you also add the mod 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.200
 you can put the nose ballet such 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 so I put it on and now the finger 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 in all rules 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.630
 very good what we do with the nose votes 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.640
 and 6 in the mine according what you have 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.220
 what to do is imagine that you are 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 looking for emeralds in the mountain 6 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.910
 general class leave only the biome of 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.860
 mountain you would have to approach 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.020
 agreement and the nose that would begin to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 moving is a bit annoying having to give 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.820
 f5 to say he moves his nose does not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.060
 moves because in front frontal but good 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.060
 It is a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.700
 it's something new if I tell you that in 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.069
 versions higher than this today what 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 they are going to put the nose to have sounds 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.120
 every time you approach an emerald 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 so then if you see this engine what 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.670
 downloads and adds that then hey to be that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.800
 activates a version higher than mine 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.410
 agreement and this little one is already 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.990
 last mod of aligned you steal the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.209
 noses slavers them a bit and then 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.190
 apart then you use them to search 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.530
 according emeralds and already this is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.750
 everything if you like other noses of reik 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.770
 subscribe and a guys help me more 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.770
 better until later
