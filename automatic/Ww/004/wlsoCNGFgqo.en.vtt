 elf eyebrows and it comes as a sidewalk and a 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.410
 dust and I'm going to use the powder the 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.770
 Shadow will also use the pencil 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 mac eyebrows in brunet color this that 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.009
 is here and to work the magic of 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.520
 everything I will use a concealer in 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.570
 cream this is from the brand logs and this is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.140
 the color line and my language ok with the tri 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 means of I'll grab me and I will 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.330
 pass over the eyebrows 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.330
 this is to start giving them color and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.030
 Besides, this product makes the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.770
 little hairs stay in one place ok ya 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.590
 that the axes are dark I'm going to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.950
 grab the mac pencil in brunet and I'll 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.220
 to start defining the eyebrows by 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.400
 medium and what I want to do is start 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.980
 Give it a little shape 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.600
 on the down side as well as on the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.960
 side up but start on the side 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 down 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.340
 and I'm adding color 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.340
 and definition 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.190
 ok that is in both axes and as 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.280
 you can see this eyebrow is a little higher 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.620
 and a little more round here and it 's tending 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.390
 to be a little flatter and what I 'm going to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.900
 do is add a bit of this height 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.870
 and this curve on this side here for 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.180
 make them look a little more similar and what 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.620
 I keep doing with my mac pencil or 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.170
 that since they are a little more they seemed 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.990
 I will continue now with the elf duo and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.650
 I'm going to grab it with an angled brush 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.590
 this the 208 of mac and now I concentrate 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.160
 what is the front and as you see 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.590
 I will try to do as a line 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.560
 down here 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.230
 and I'm going to join the upper part forward with 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.739
 what we have already done 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.250
 I will fill this area following well 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.250
 upwards 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.560
 blurring what in 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.280
 although now that I have my eyebrows already 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.959
 as I want I can leave them like this but the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.060
 idea of this video is to show you the magic 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.040
 of the proofreader and here I have my 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.200
 corrector that I will use it with this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 little brush that is here simply 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.650
 just a little bit of this color that is the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.410
 medium and we're going to start cleaning 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.050
 under the eyebrows 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.160
 and this is going to be an effect like if you 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.080
 you just passed the wax and you just 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.640
 clean your eyebrows what comes here 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.830
 in front 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.970
 is that you're going to do it like a 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.970
 hairline like a hairline 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.140
 A) Yes 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.630
 and from there they will grab that corrector and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.440
 they're going to start doing down to 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.440
 blur it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.040
 little by little and even here 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.519
 and now he blurs it and I hold my finger 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.750
 and it blurred what it was when it diffused 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.760
 what is very close to the eyebrows 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.709
 because then you're going to damage what 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.709
 you did up and here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.950
 it simply diffuses it in this way 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.750
 You are playing your crime 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.110
 there's also up there are people who 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.300
 they do it from here to here but I 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.300
 like to concentrate on what is 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.210
 the arc 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.780
 because I think that's where 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.160
 need as more 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.320
 as a correction or to be cleaned and here 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.680
 up I do not put much but a 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.680
 poquitico 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.200
 he blurred it 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.210
 with the finger 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.060
 see how this part looks a bit more 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.390
 illuminated and like that eyebrows looks more 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.710
 defined and cleaner they know as if 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.180
 I just left the beauty salon like this 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.190
 well then that's how the final look was 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.639
 already with makeup 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.889
 look how the eyebrows were 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.659
 it's true that they look pretty as I do 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.030
 gave him at first the eyebrows are raw 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.310
 two sisters not twin I imagine 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.189
 that many of you will understand me from 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.770
 that can not be done equally but tried 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:24.699
 to make it as similar as possible and 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.800
 with him the trick of the concealer as it 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.659
 It has made much much easier for me 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.009
 clean them and make them look more 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.509
 pretty so I hope that I have 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.099
 liked the video 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.129
