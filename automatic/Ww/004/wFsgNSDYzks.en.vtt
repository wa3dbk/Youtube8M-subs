00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

I<00:00:00.120> often<00:00:00.539> talk<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:00.870> my<00:00:00.960> swimmers<00:00:01.260> about<00:00:01.669> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
I often talk to my swimmers about the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.530 
I often talk to my swimmers about the
similarities<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.920> using<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.980> car<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.670> ice<00:00:06.060> where

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
similarities of using a car on ice where

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.509 
similarities of using a car on ice where
there's<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.990> slipping<00:00:07.859> as<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.069> try<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> go

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
there's this slipping as we try to go

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.759 
there's this slipping as we try to go
faster<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> same<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.469> our

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
faster and it's the same in our

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.060 
faster and it's the same in our
freestyle<00:00:11.330> especially<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.570> initial

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
freestyle especially in that initial

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
freestyle especially in that initial
setting<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.400> platform<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.299> travel

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
setting up that platform to travel

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.859 
setting up that platform to travel
forward<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.340> absolutely<00:00:17.940> crucial<00:00:18.210> that

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
forward now it's absolutely crucial that

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.599 
forward now it's absolutely crucial that
when<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.470> whole<00:00:19.710> connection<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
when we get that whole connection to the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
when we get that whole connection to the
core<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.810> shift<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.400> core<00:00:23.960> towards

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
core there's a shift of the core towards

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
core there's a shift of the core towards
the<00:00:25.109> hands<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.400> using<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> momentum

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the hands and then using the momentum

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
the hands and then using the momentum
and<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:29.000> force<00:00:30.000> from<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> stroke

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and the force from here on to the stroke

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.479 
and the force from here on to the stroke
to<00:00:32.790> shift<00:00:33.149> into<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> next<00:00:33.989> stroke<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to shift into the next stroke this is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
to shift into the next stroke this is
the<00:00:35.610> fastest<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.420> freestyle<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the fastest way to do freestyle and the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
the fastest way to do freestyle and the
timing<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> crucial<00:00:39.110> one<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
timing of this is crucial one of the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
timing of this is crucial one of the
things<00:00:40.379> that's<00:00:40.469> common<00:00:41.040> amongst<00:00:41.370> great

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
things that's common amongst great

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
things that's common amongst great
freestyle<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.110> generally<00:00:43.379> find<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
freestyle is is you generally find that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.569 
freestyle is is you generally find that
the<00:00:44.460> fingers<00:00:44.910> immediately<00:00:45.980> face<00:00:46.980> downwards

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the fingers immediately face downwards

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
the fingers immediately face downwards
or<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:48.239> early<00:00:48.690> part<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> stroke<00:00:49.379> there's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
or very early part of the stroke there's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.180 
or very early part of the stroke there's
this<00:00:50.399> power<00:00:51.090> part<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> make

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this power part here so we want to make

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
this power part here so we want to make
sure<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:54.000> whether<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> high

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
sure that whether we're going the high

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
sure that whether we're going the high
elbow<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.129> distance<00:00:56.579> freestyle<00:00:57.090> or

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
elbow like in the distance freestyle or

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
elbow like in the distance freestyle or
the<00:00:57.899> deeper<00:00:58.320> stroke<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> fingers

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the deeper stroke that the fingers

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
the deeper stroke that the fingers
directly<00:01:00.690> face<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> bottom<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> pool<00:01:02.190> as

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
directly face the bottom of the pool as

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
directly face the bottom of the pool as
they<00:01:03.090> shift<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.870> transfer<00:01:04.830> their<00:01:05.100> weight

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
they shift and transfer their weight

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
they shift and transfer their weight
forward<00:01:05.939> over<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> stroke<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.830> right

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
forward over the stroke now right

through the hole back into the freestyle

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
through the hole back into the freestyle
we<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.070> sure<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> wrist<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> very

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
we want to make sure the wrist is very

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.830 
we want to make sure the wrist is very
firm<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.530> still<00:01:14.189> keep<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.150> pressure

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
firm and we still keep that pressure

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740 
firm and we still keep that pressure
that<00:01:16.409> feel<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> water<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.479> end

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that feel on the water at the back end

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
that feel on the water at the back end
of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> stroke<00:01:19.170> once<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> whole<00:01:20.640> set

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of the stroke once we get this whole set

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
of the stroke once we get this whole set
up<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> stroke<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.689> we're<00:01:21.810> travelling

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
up with a stroke and we're travelling

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890 
up with a stroke and we're travelling
forward<00:01:22.530> our<00:01:23.430> body<00:01:23.759> needs<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> rotate<00:01:24.360> over

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
forward our body needs to rotate over

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
forward our body needs to rotate over
the<00:01:25.259> stroke<00:01:25.619> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.880> exit

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the stroke into the exit

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.999 
the stroke into the exit
they're<00:01:27.810> quite<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.170> we're<00:01:28.409> making<00:01:28.680> mistake

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
they're quite off we're making mistake

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.810 
they're quite off we're making mistake
as<00:01:29.159> swimmers<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.650> accelerate<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> push<00:01:32.610> all

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
as swimmers to accelerate and push all

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
as swimmers to accelerate and push all
the<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:32.939> back<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.479> cost<00:01:34.049> tension<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the way back which cost tension here in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.640 
the way back which cost tension here in
the<00:01:35.189> shoulder<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.659> locks<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> swimming

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the shoulder and just locks the swimming

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.890 
the shoulder and just locks the swimming
I<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.150> soon<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> hand

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I like to see that as soon as the hand

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
I like to see that as soon as the hand
gets<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> belly<00:01:40.860> button<00:01:41.130> area<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
gets to about the belly button area it's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
gets to about the belly button area it's
like<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> karate<00:01:42.810> chop<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> freestyle

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
like a karate chop into the freestyle

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
like a karate chop into the freestyle
the<00:01:44.759> reason<00:01:45.149> why<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.899> an

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the reason why I just think it's an

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the reason why I just think it's an
easier<00:01:46.560> movement<00:01:47.329> through<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> stroke<00:01:49.040> into

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
easier movement through the stroke into

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
easier movement through the stroke into
back<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> next<00:01:51.090> stroke<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
back into the next stroke of the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
back into the next stroke of the
recovery<00:01:52.320> depending<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.890> doing

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
recovery depending if you're doing

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
recovery depending if you're doing
distance<00:01:53.790> freestyle<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.479> sprint<00:01:55.380> freestyle

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
distance freestyle or sprint freestyle

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
distance freestyle or sprint freestyle
so<00:01:56.399> once<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> belly<00:01:57.329> button<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so once I get to the belly button and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
so once I get to the belly button and
they're<00:01:57.899> travelling<00:01:58.380> forward<00:01:58.649> there's<00:01:59.310> an

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
they're travelling forward there's an

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.450 
they're travelling forward there's an
acceleration<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.320> talked<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.159> front

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
acceleration as I talked about the front

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
acceleration as I talked about the front
part<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> stroke<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.240> slower<00:02:03.659> we're

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
part of the stroke it's slower we're

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.069 
part of the stroke it's slower we're
setting<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> platform<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.420> rotate<00:02:06.930> our

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
setting up that platform to rotate our

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
setting up that platform to rotate our
body<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> stroke<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.970> there's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
body over the stroke and then there's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.050 
body over the stroke and then there's
this<00:02:09.270> acceleration<00:02:10.259> an<00:02:10.920> aggressive<00:02:11.610> movement

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this acceleration an aggressive movement

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.380 
this acceleration an aggressive movement
where<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.660> too<00:02:12.900> little<00:02:13.020> me

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
where it's too little me

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.510 
where it's too little me
turn<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.720> pressure<00:02:14.020> on<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> water<00:02:14.470> into<00:02:15.400> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
turn that pressure on the water into the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940 
turn that pressure on the water into the
next<00:02:15.790> row
