side in this film I think they can keep
going<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.380> mean<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.540> it's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
going I mean I just I just I think it's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.960 
going I mean I just I just I think it's
amazing<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.200> every<00:02:14.830> Pixar<00:02:15.280> film<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.790> comes

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
out is like the cutting edge technology

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.930 
out is like the cutting edge technology
at<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.820> time<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:21.489> gets<00:02:21.670> better
