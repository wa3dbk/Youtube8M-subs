00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
hey you two met with another video and

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.670 
hey you two met with another video and
this<00:00:08.710> one's<00:00:08.889> even<00:00:09.070> better<00:00:09.340> than<00:00:10.469> some<00:00:11.469> of<00:00:11.590> the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
this one's even better than some of the

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.660 
this one's even better than some of the
ones<00:00:11.889> i<00:00:12.010> posted<00:00:12.400> I<00:00:12.580> one<00:00:12.910> close<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.090> three<00:00:13.480> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
ones i posted I one close to three and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.540 
ones i posted I one close to three and
this<00:00:15.670> one's<00:00:15.879> probably<00:00:16.030> the<00:00:16.390> hardest<00:00:17.110> to<00:00:17.260> do<00:00:17.550> so

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
this one's probably the hardest to do so

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.550 
this one's probably the hardest to do so
but<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:19.300> works<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.750> best<00:00:19.900> so<00:00:20.170> just<00:00:20.440> keep

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
but it works the best so just keep

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.800 
but it works the best so just keep
trying<00:00:20.800> if<00:00:20.949> you<00:00:21.099> don't<00:00:21.250> get<00:00:21.400> it<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.689> really

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
trying if you don't get it it's a really

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.419 
trying if you don't get it it's a really
big<00:00:23.080> glitcher<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.529> get<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:23.800> work<00:00:23.949> I've<00:00:24.279> only

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
big glitcher to get it to work I've only

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.970 
big glitcher to get it to work I've only
done<00:00:24.670> a<00:00:24.730> couple<00:00:25.090> times<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.769> probably

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
done a couple times and you probably

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.349 
done a couple times and you probably
haven't<00:00:27.189> seen<00:00:27.310> on<00:00:27.519> youtube<00:00:27.910> or<00:00:28.029> anywhere<00:00:28.300> else

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
haven't seen on youtube or anywhere else

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.839 
haven't seen on youtube or anywhere else
because<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:29.920> my<00:00:30.009> friend<00:00:30.279> found<00:00:30.429> it<00:00:30.669> and

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
because me and my friend found it and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because me and my friend found it and
this<00:00:30.970> is<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.179> first<00:00:31.210> time<00:00:31.509> we<00:00:31.839> actually

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
this is the first time we actually

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.740 
this is the first time we actually
decided<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.470> post<00:00:32.680> it<00:00:32.890> because<00:00:33.160> it's<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.510> good

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
decided to post it because it's so good

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
works so to be able to do this glitch

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.270 
works so to be able to do this glitch
you<00:00:40.180> need<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.989> really<00:00:41.860> light<00:00:42.039> gun

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
handgun like a pistol the one that you

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.240 
handgun like a pistol the one that you
start<00:00:47.050> out<00:00:47.140> with<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.350> van<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:47.710> I've<00:00:48.010> the

Magnum<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:50.609> so<00:00:51.609> see<00:00:51.850> I<00:00:51.879> got<00:00:52.090> two<00:00:52.270> crawlers<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
Magnum and so see I got two crawlers you

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.880 
Magnum and so see I got two crawlers you
buy<00:00:54.879> more<00:00:55.809> than<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.050> use<00:00:56.379> like<00:00:56.530> two<00:00:56.710> or<00:00:56.859> three

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
buy more than one use like two or three

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
buy more than one use like two or three
and<00:00:57.309> then<00:00:59.160> there's<00:01:00.160> this<00:01:00.280> barrel<00:01:00.640> over<00:01:00.730> here

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and then there's this barrel over here

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.930 
and then there's this barrel over here
so<00:01:02.649> there's<00:01:02.859> like<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.039> little<00:01:03.280> gap<00:01:03.429> behind<00:01:03.609> it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
so there's like a little gap behind it

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.090 
so there's like a little gap behind it
you<00:01:04.540> know<00:01:04.600> crouch<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.290> then<00:01:05.530> get<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.920> there

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
you know crouch and then get in there

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.030 
you know crouch and then get in there
behind<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.729> little<00:01:10.000> hard<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
behind and it's a little hard but you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.700 
behind and it's a little hard but you
can<00:01:12.189> probably<00:01:12.310> get<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:12.939> try<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.710> walk

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
can probably get it if you try and walk

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.649 
can probably get it if you try and walk
in<00:01:14.950> there<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.220> then<00:01:15.460> jump<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.000> just<00:01:16.450> keep

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
in there and then jump and just keep

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.580 
in there and then jump and just keep
trying<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:17.049> get<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.320> there<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.590> see

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
trying to get in there I got it see

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.010 
trying to get in there I got it see
they're<00:01:20.710> not<00:01:20.770> going<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.009> come<00:01:21.130> any<00:01:21.310> closer<00:01:22.020> as

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
they're not going to come any closer as

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.710 
they're not going to come any closer as
close<00:01:23.259> as<00:01:23.409> they<00:01:23.530> get

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.440 

and<00:01:27.460> will<00:01:28.460> eventually<00:01:28.550> stop<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.270> right

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and will eventually stop like right

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.170 
and will eventually stop like right
there<00:01:30.220> they<00:01:31.220> may<00:01:31.400> look<00:01:31.760> like<00:01:31.820> they're<00:01:32.090> getting

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
there they may look like they're getting

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.830 
there they may look like they're getting
a<00:01:32.330> little<00:01:32.450> closer<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:33.350> didn't<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:34.100> right

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
a little closer so I didn't do it right

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.600 
a little closer so I didn't do it right
but<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.770> keep<00:01:36.860> trying<00:01:37.160> i<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.430> probably

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
but you can keep trying i can probably

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.820 
but you can keep trying i can probably
get<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.120> not<00:01:38.270> too<00:01:38.450> hard<00:01:41.620> gotta<00:01:42.620> wait<00:01:42.800> for

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
get it it's not too hard gotta wait for

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.380 
get it it's not too hard gotta wait for
him<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.070> come<00:01:43.190> back<00:01:43.250> here<00:01:44.890> okay<00:01:45.890> see<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.240> it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
him to come back here okay see it all it

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.470 
him to come back here okay see it all it
is<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:47.660> in<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.960> corner<00:01:48.760> far<00:01:49.760> back<00:01:50.060> over<00:01:50.360> there

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
is is in that corner far back over there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.770 
is is in that corner far back over there
gotta<00:01:51.200> get<00:01:51.290> in<00:01:51.440> there<00:01:54.820> not<00:01:55.820> too<00:01:56.000> bad<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.450> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
gotta get in there not too bad and the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.240 
gotta get in there not too bad and the
only<00:01:56.810> reason<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.260> like<00:01:57.470> gun<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.950> thinking

only reason you like gun is thinking

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
only reason you like gun is thinking
like<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.240> reload<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.410> big<00:02:00.500> of

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
like you reload and it's not that big of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.320 
like you reload and it's not that big of
a<00:02:00.680> deal<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.340> one<00:02:01.490> ruffles<00:02:01.850> get<00:02:02.030> because
