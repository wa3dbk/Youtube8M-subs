00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.950
 what I have is 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.450
 the mind headphones because because 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.760
 we do in the street without headphones we 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.470
 we put a rocket and also in case 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
 perhaps because he never higher 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.930
 they broke the headphones or the old one 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.890

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.239
 talking and it's already being spent for that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.400
 we have arrived for that reason I have it the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.909
 wallet 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.340
 because as I do not put it because 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:47.810
 I have a hand cream behind the recipe 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.810
 and it's rich because it 's vanilla we have 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.610
 karina soup after I have a sweater 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.040
 black that I always have in the portfolio 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.930
 because if it's cold or between lord 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.970
 what air conditioning or something have 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.690
 always a hydro that you have with everything is 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.510

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.159
 the cat behind and very good after 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.159
 obviously I have a pen 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.120
 I think that 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.590
 Hi, it's me 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.990
 and after I have 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.840
 the best pills you ate in your 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.370
 I bought them in urban outfitters and 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.990
 man actually with the box because 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.370
 these are a fusion type I thought they were 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.370
 common pill type and look 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.900
 if we arrive are colored skulls and 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.900
 apart they are rich 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.439
 they save 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.479
 well then always something to read 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.639
 this is a good option in case you 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.080
 happens what we talk about music in the 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.759
 collective on the subway or where you go 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.090
 to have it because sometimes one goes to a 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.009
 place to wait for something like that and has little 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.469
 cell phone battery and then you have 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.300
 something to read as I am jelinek guy 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.770

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.389
