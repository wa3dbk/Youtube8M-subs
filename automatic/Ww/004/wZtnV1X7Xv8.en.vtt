00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.630
 the location of a city its meaning 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 the decay write his unwanted dramaturgy 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.569
 their factories remind their homes in places like that one 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.199
 vitality 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.909
 People say they do not make comments 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.509
 but then people are against 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.509
 easy on life 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.749
 the bar Stadtumbau has searched in Saxony-anhalt ways 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.460
 to describe a future for such shrinking regions and 

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:32.150
 To make quality of life 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.470
 although the belt is getting tighter 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.490
 we can not do anything 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.230
 if we have no money the rest will be next to the pension amount but then 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.030
 once 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 many plans 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 in the planning age 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.970
 and not assigned to embedded over the experimental discussion 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 Wisdom tooth it all at once he clear that one would have the captain 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.580
 while Werder owes Coburger come to the west of Seedorf 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 you have to accept the causes of shrinking around the vicious circle 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 breaking new ideas too much state too few people 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.750
 that also price off the band is perforated locked 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 where buildings will fall 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 it is the consequent departure from the dogma the eternal growth the renaturation 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.410
 once built-up areas 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.020
 What seems to be wild today is tomorrow even a feeling of life 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 do not improve more beautiful prospects for again 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.970
 the Bauhaus important the pens of this iPad 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.290
 and here are the plans presented by the 19er also presented on the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.880
 first look fall handles and abstract conceptions fall no 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.940
 spectacular architecture 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 who prefers provides impulses for imagination 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.440
 For that had to be the boss and bauhaus director Philipp Oswalt 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.079
 to be completely different levels 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170
 although of course it does not make it a consensus 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.539
 the political majorities 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.919
 in the state government and also an urban one 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.700
 he fails 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.699
 to organize in the cities 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.099
 and the only thing that really works 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.640
 moving forward on unknown territory it is also about experiments 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.719
 and that one makes there projects which had struck the Fed again 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.499
 Fri si 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.409
 what is Ruud like? 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.339
 the hamas representative must do more 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.979
 Visible traces had left the beacons Aschersleben 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.120
 the power of conviction must now prove itself in the field test 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.630
 an injured organism pulls together protect 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.769
 the duty of the own box 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.169
 In difficult times, consolidation stands for stability 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.389
 For example, colorful pictures impose empty ones on the edges 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.199
 surfaces 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.729
 who, as a beautiful shine, will reduce the fear of shrinking 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.449
 At the minimum wage Norman Paech is problem for the city 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.209
 So most of the Hamburger SV and new markets and so charming blindness 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.719
 look different than the city apartment romance on 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.229
 on this gate 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.649
 ugly building on it to process Borisow right or just 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.449
 fast way and rotor out of the way 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.930
 an ugly blown out is then a modern discovery phase 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.179
 according to the motto 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.139
 Witnesses Quirk makes the changes clear 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.189
 he himself has Lisicki but solutions speak critics of the attraction too 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.989
 drive 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.129
 this attraction are more common 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.459
 have been satisfied with these short-term successes 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.939
 and we all wish 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.839
 all are percent what a year ago also officially outstanding 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.540
 We want to remember that the whole thing is that 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.950
 Recovery is correct the system image of our cityscape may need to blast 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.839
 leave a job system to search his new system and abandoned this search 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.019
 and now the economy is going but now I want to read that 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.680
 means we still have to be the biggest in the Mainzer of investors and should always 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 still circles and then relatively soon only known culture 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.379
 Halberstadt has well explained the teachers to those whose own worth by others 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.849
 Perspective can still be increased 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.999
 new thinking requires breaking with familiar patterns 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519
 especially in places with a very personal history 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.430
 the people in shrinking cities besides dealing with one else like that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.379
 negatively occupied term 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.400
 Problems also shrink as soon as they are spoken openly 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.569
 Halberstadt are aware of us 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.210
 the phase before planning focuses we believe that we are developing funds 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.900
 Love should be around to face the problem we have 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:41.389
 Not unkempt the doctrine is the weird and the beast theme in general 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.909
 that we are always talking about deconstruction urban redevelopment is in the case 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.770
 Core cosmetic term for the problem around existing ones 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.490
 when growth fails, consequences are uncomfortable truths 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.380
 entire settlements and cities 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.300
 that suddenly stop working bring living spaces to their limits 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.080
 their durability 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.469
 the discussions who should bear this burden in the end 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 it has just begun 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.599
 The bar is a clear pointer to what we actually have 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:11.469
 began 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.720
 Shrinkage will impact education processes 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.830
 which then also for the welfare state 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.180
 can not be without consequences 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.599
 the question is not one of 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.059
 Welfare state say 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.449
 the signs guarantee living conditions 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.389
 the rest 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.669
 in the oldest part of the one or 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.180
 but there is a daughter now 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.100
 Hall is preparing against concept days of the field that responsible 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.280
 says the state also pulls out quite well from certain areas 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.409
 back 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.029
 the people who still stay in the regions 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.569
 the night of the economy 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.759
 also the start to turn your back 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.249
 they will be new website 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.509
 she could not be a solution to this problem 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.539
 It can give suggestions which future can be started with less
