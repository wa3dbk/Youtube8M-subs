bit<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.309> i'm<00:00:35.370> showing<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.480> main

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bit here that i'm showing is the main

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.860 
bit here that i'm showing is the main
control<00:00:37.170> unit<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> X<00:00:38.040> commandos<00:00:38.870> and

controller with a nunchuck and a mouse

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
controller with a nunchuck and a mouse
and<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.000> used<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.270> xbox<00:00:45.930> ps3<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.180> pc

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and it can be used on xbox ps3 and pc

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
and it can be used on xbox ps3 and pc
and<00:00:48.750> let<00:00:49.710> me<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.129> people<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> play

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and let me see what people want to play

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
and let me see what people want to play
PC<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> can't<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.690> used<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> button

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
PC but the can't get used to the button

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.150 
PC but the can't get used to the button
so<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.489> great<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:55.160> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so that you know this is a great way to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
so that you know this is a great way to
get<00:00:56.280> past<00:00:56.430> using<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> buttons<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.629> use

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
get past using the buttons and to use

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
get past using the buttons and to use
like<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.320> xbox<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.219> position<00:00:59.640> shooing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
like on xbox from our position shooing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.220 
like on xbox from our position shooing
so<00:01:00.239> I'll<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.629> through<00:01:00.840> how<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.050> works

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so I'll just go through how it works

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.200 
so I'll just go through how it works
obviously<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> control<00:01:02.699> station<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
trigger so basically going to be using
that<00:01:48.990> hand<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> run<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> zoom<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.149> it's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that hand to run and zoom in so it's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
that hand to run and zoom in so it's
pretty<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> Xbox<00:01:52.619> part<00:01:53.009> or

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
pretty much just like the Xbox part or

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
pretty much just like the Xbox part or
the<00:01:53.340> PlayStation<00:01:53.880> part<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the PlayStation part but it's just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.569 
the PlayStation part but it's just
obviously<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.310> you've<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
obviously that and then you've got the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
obviously that and then you've got the
mouse<00:01:56.759> separate<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> way<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.649> works

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
mouse separate and so the way it works

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
mouse separate and so the way it works
is<00:01:59.100> basically<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.549> plug<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:01.110> command

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
is basically just plug in the command

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550 
is basically just plug in the command
center<00:02:01.880> into<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> xbox<00:02:03.840> normal<00:02:04.170> part<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
center into the xbox normal part of the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
center into the xbox normal part of the
PlayStation<00:02:05.100> normal<00:02:05.340> part<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
PlayStation normal part and then all you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
PlayStation normal part and then all you
simply<00:02:06.570> need<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.229> pop<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> wired

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
simply need to do is just pop in a wired

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.440 
simply need to do is just pop in a wired
controller<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> set<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
controller this is just to set the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
controller this is just to set the
buttons<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.080> remove<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.709> once<00:02:11.099> you've

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
buttons you can remove it once you've

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.680 
buttons you can remove it once you've
actually<00:02:11.400> said<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> goes<00:02:12.209> green<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
actually said it so it goes green for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.670 
actually said it so it goes green for
xbox<00:02:13.080> blue

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
xbox blue

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.580 
xbox blue
or<00:02:13.769> ps3<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:14.969> think<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.390> may<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.569> read<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.140> pc

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
or ps3 and I think it may be read for pc

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.970 
or ps3 and I think it may be read for pc
I<00:02:16.769> haven't<00:02:17.040> tried<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> pc<00:02:17.760> yet<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.859> and<00:02:19.859> as

some<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> go<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.419> a<00:03:18.599> accurate<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.650> a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
some of you go to a accurate with a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.099 
some of you go to a accurate with a
control<00:03:20.159> pod<00:03:20.449> you<00:03:21.449> know<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.989> to

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
control pod you know this is going to

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.479 
control pod you know this is going to
take<00:03:22.199> it<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.440> next<00:03:22.620> level<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:23.069> just<00:03:23.310> like

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
take it to next level it's just like

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.240 
take it to next level it's just like
using<00:03:23.699> the<00:03:23.940> pc<00:03:24.150> mouse<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.680> obviously<00:03:25.769> back

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
using the pc mouse but obviously back

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.069 
using the pc mouse but obviously back
it's<00:03:26.609> got<00:03:26.760> these<00:03:26.879> custom<00:03:27.329> controls<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.959> and

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it's got these custom controls on it and

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.449 
it's got these custom controls on it and
the<00:03:28.290> accuracy<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:28.979> can<00:03:29.099> get<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.280> this

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
the accuracy that you can get with this

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.849 
the accuracy that you can get with this
is<00:03:29.669> ridiculous<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.479> mean<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.959> said<00:03:31.079> I'm<00:03:31.799> not

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
is ridiculous I mean like I said I'm not

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.710 
is ridiculous I mean like I said I'm not
much<00:03:32.189> of<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.370> sniper<00:03:32.669> but<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:32.970> was<00:03:33.239> picking<00:03:33.479> off
