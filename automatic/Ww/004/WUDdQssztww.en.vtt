00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
want to add a second layer so let's grab

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.609 
want to add a second layer so let's grab
another<00:01:04.350> video<00:01:04.979> clip<00:01:05.330> tip<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> data<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
sure you click picture and picture as

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
sure you click picture and picture as
you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.620> picture<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.830> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can see we now have a picture in a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
you can see we now have a picture in a
picture<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> adjust<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.100> size<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.700> can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
picture you can adjust the size you can

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420 
picture you can adjust the size you can
adjust<00:01:32.970> steps<00:01:33.540> position<00:01:34.229> things<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
adjust steps position things like that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
adjust steps position things like that
so<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:37.260> of<00:01:37.350> handy<00:01:37.760> it's<00:01:38.760> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so so these can be kind of handy it's a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640 
so so these can be kind of handy it's a
common<00:01:39.360> special<00:01:39.750> effect<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> lot<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
common special effect that a lot of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
common special effect that a lot of
people<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
people use but now as you can see I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.370 
people use but now as you can see I
movie<00:01:43.440> has<00:01:43.979> two<00:01:44.850> layers<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:45.689> our<00:01:45.869> original

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
movie has two layers it has our original

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.679 
movie has two layers it has our original
footage<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.830> what<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.760> did<00:01:48.000> our<00:01:48.060> overlap

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
footage and what we just did our overlap

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.500 
footage and what we just did our overlap
from<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.189> try<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> add<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.200> another<00:01:52.200> layer

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
from so if I try and add a another layer

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.200 
from so if I try and add a another layer
scrab<00:01:54.510> one<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> these<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.820> over<00:01:56.970> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
scrab one of these and put it over to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
scrab one of these and put it over to
blue<00:01:57.450> I<00:02:00.259> can't<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> let

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
blue I can't really do that when I let

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.800 
blue I can't really do that when I let
go<00:02:04.009> picture<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.100> picture<00:02:05.189> doesn't<00:02:05.549> appear<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
go picture and picture doesn't appear so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
go picture and picture doesn't appear so
this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> basically<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.740> movie<00:02:08.250> only<00:02:08.580> allowing

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
this is basically I movie only allowing

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140 
this is basically I movie only allowing
for<00:02:09.330> two<00:02:09.600> layers<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.310> layer<00:02:11.519> one<00:02:11.850> here

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
for two layers you have layer one here

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.180 
for two layers you have layer one here
the<00:02:12.299> background<00:02:12.750> layer<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.560> blue<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the background layer to the blue is the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.050 
the background layer to the blue is the
foreground<00:02:15.350> now<00:02:16.350> next<00:02:16.860> tutorial<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.549> little

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
foreground now next tutorial a little

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.550 
foreground now next tutorial a little
bit<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.239> foreshadowing<00:02:18.450> will<00:02:19.049> be<00:02:19.170> how<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.380> do

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
bit of foreshadowing will be how to do

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
bit of foreshadowing will be how to do
multiple<00:02:19.829> picture<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.610> picture<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.239> can

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
multiple picture in picture so you can

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
multiple picture in picture so you can
have<00:02:21.570> multiple<00:02:22.380> layers<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.100> layers<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.549> that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
have multiple layers and layers but that

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.670 
have multiple layers and layers but that
takes<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.150> bit<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.390> explaining<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.500> needs

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
takes a bit of explaining so that needs

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.710 
takes a bit of explaining so that needs
its<00:02:25.830> own<00:02:25.920> tutorial<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:27.209> picture<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.690> picture

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.440 
its own tutorial now picture in picture
it<00:02:28.560> works<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.280> know<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.640> two<00:02:30.060> video

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it works you know with two video

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.990 
it works you know with two video
but<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> video<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.099> actual

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
but if you have a video and a actual

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
but if you have a video and a actual
picture<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:34.349> could<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.650> some<00:02:34.890> issues<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
picture you could have some issues so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.979 
picture you could have some issues so
let's<00:02:38.220> find<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.700> picture<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.599> show<00:02:40.349> off

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
let's find a picture that can show off

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.110 
let's find a picture that can show off
so<00:02:42.989> here<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> little<00:02:44.580> nuke<00:02:44.819> I've<00:02:45.000> been

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so here is a little nuke I've been

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.240 
so here is a little nuke I've been
working<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.480> once<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.110> find<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.620> picture<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.490 
working on once you find the picture you
want<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> use<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:48.569> drag<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.170> put<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
want to use you don't drag it and put it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.280 
want to use you don't drag it and put it
into<00:02:49.680> your<00:02:49.830> event<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.480> drag<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.019> put
