00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.520
 I will explain cprm cancellation again 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.119
 I use cprm decrypter again 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.670
 Insert copied dvd into PC drive 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:22.000
 Of course you need a cprm compatible drive to read cprm 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.619
 If it is bundled and can not be reproduced, it can be used at the manufacturer site 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.020
 Please check if the drive specified in the drive settings 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:38.949
 Specify the output destination When you are ready, click on the write button to the specified desk 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:41.230
 Time the folder is created can be completed in around 15 minutes more information, introduced in another video 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.990
 Please check 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.360
 Said this time 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:51.270
 General play dvd from cprm dvd r v not playable with pan player 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 The purpose is to create video 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.500
 I have a folder on my desk 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 Ifo and vro files are ready 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 Rewrite vor extension to mpeg 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.260
 In the case of multiple recording run the vro 2 split 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 It is introduction of program this time and it takes about 25 minutes for writing 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.960
 Contact the crust the crust the crust 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:26.690
 Split mpeg will be created in the specified folder by dividing for each program 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.690
 Please make sure that the original file is created Yonggi mpeg but Yonggi is enough 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.649
 You can create mpeg using dvd flick as an example 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.159
 And export 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.289
 Of course dvd created is video method 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.289
 Most players can play 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.050
 Although dvd flick is introduced separately with the video 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.050
 I think it is the number one in writing speed 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.350
 d vics 2 dvd not even overlook dvd create folder 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.740
 Using dvd shrink's re-editing function 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:09.229
 I think the commercial cut editing is also interesting 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.490
 Of course starting from commercial dvd creation with free dvd dub street 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.490
 Can also 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.530
 This time cp 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.370
 Create a dvd rv or dvd video with the drm unzipped folder 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 to watch 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.040
 There are conditions for dvd video creation 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.040
 I think you can not create in the free version 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.930
 I will use the geography dvd r double 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.140
 Blank dvd r double inserted into write drive 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 Specify the write drive in the drive selection 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.790
 Specify the cprm decrypter creation folder for dvd rta ç¬› 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.569
 It is a check Click to put a check in finalization 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.680
 Writing starts when vr write button is clicked 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.040
 Please use r double if you think about versatility 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.030
 There is also r compatible with this model 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 Dvd that could be versatile big Desu' in Pearl double specification vi 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:10.430
 It is a method, but cprm has been canceled 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:15.890
 Even if cprm is not supported, it is reproducible if it is equipped with a recorder function 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:22.020
 Unfortunately, it is very difficult with cprm non-playback players 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.300
 Authoring with Flick etc. Sure in the end Poppo environment ulead dvd 6 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.440
 We are using the b writer 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:32.470
 Waist I also touch this 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.160
 In celebration copy item dvd + vr and - converted to vr video dvd video 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.690

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.810
 insert dvd 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.260
 Specify the inserted drive in 9 folder items 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:58.110
 When using multiple drives for copy destination drive 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.140
 Insert a blank disc at the copy destination This time, boot with the same drive 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.290
 Copy start button click when ready 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.319
 Although omitted from here , the tray opens when an image file is created 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:17.199
 It will ask for a blank desk. Writing starts with the insertion of a blank disc . 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.910
 The dvd made is playable on most video players and the time is 30 hours an hour 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.050
 It takes about minutes 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.280
 Accompanying but pot PC acer Cheap computer 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.980
 Of course cprm correspondence at the time of purchase 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.250
 There is no large dvd nor moviewriter etc. I borrowed from a friend 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.100
 I downloaded from cd-rom 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.450
 I got it by chance from the consultation of cprm exe 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.600
 Please keep in mind the moviewriter at the time of purchase of the attached drive 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.770
 It may be possible with other authoring software though 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:55.940
 As long as Poppo knows this feature is only moviewriter 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.940
 If you have a moviewriter on hand, we recommend reintroduction
