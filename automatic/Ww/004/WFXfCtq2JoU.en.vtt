00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
flat one fiber screen but it's obviously

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's also going to be IP 68 certified so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's also going to be IP 68 certified so
that<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.740> dust<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> water

really explain it you guys just like
watch<00:02:27.799> a<00:02:27.890> video<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.450> anyways<00:02:29.650> moving<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
watch a video on it anyways moving on a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.649 
watch a video on it anyways moving on a
camera<00:02:31.159> it's<00:02:31.790> also<00:02:31.970> booming<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.420> gonna<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:32.629> a

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
camera it's also booming it's gonna be a

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.050 
camera it's also booming it's gonna be a
twenty<00:02:33.079> point<00:02:33.260> seven<00:02:33.650> megapixel<00:02:34.099> camera<00:02:34.400> or

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
twenty point seven megapixel camera or

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.390 
twenty point seven megapixel camera or
possibly<00:02:35.599> even<00:02:35.659> higher<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.890> corner<00:02:37.220> leaks

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
possibly even higher but corner leaks

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.399 
possibly even higher but corner leaks
that's<00:02:37.549> around<00:02:37.790> 20<00:02:38.060> megapixels<00:02:38.569> along<00:02:39.260> with

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
that's around 20 megapixels along with

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.559 
that's around 20 megapixels along with
4k<00:02:39.829> recording<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.579> you'll<00:02:40.879> be<00:02:41.000> recording<00:02:41.390> at

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
4k recording so you'll be recording at

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.550 
4k recording so you'll be recording at
4k<00:02:41.810> resolution<00:02:42.140> which<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:43.099> very<00:02:43.280> high<00:02:43.489> res

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
4k resolution which is a very high res

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.750 
4k resolution which is a very high res
apparent<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:45.650> gonna<00:02:45.739> have<00:02:45.950> us<00:02:46.129> Sony<00:02:46.519> boom

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
apparent it's gonna have us Sony boom

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.119 
apparent it's gonna have us Sony boom
sound<00:02:46.970> speakers<00:02:47.090> also<00:02:47.599> so<00:02:47.989> that's<00:02:48.620> apparently

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
sound speakers also so that's apparently

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.800 
sound speakers also so that's apparently
like<00:02:49.280> comparable<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.970> Beats<00:02:50.269> Audio<00:02:50.420> found

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
like comparable to the Beats Audio found

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.050 
like comparable to the Beats Audio found
on<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> HTC<00:02:51.379> so<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.400> should<00:02:52.579> sound<00:02:52.790> really

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
on the HTC so it should sound really

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.250 
on the HTC so it should sound really
good<00:02:53.180> when<00:02:53.420> not<00:02:53.629> playing<00:02:53.930> with<00:02:54.049> headphones

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
good when not playing with headphones

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.460 
good when not playing with headphones
like<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:54.980> regular<00:02:55.239> speaker<00:02:56.239> mode<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:57.200> it's

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
like just regular speaker mode and it's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.509 
like just regular speaker mode and it's
also<00:02:57.590> gonna<00:02:57.709> call<00:02:57.889> the<00:02:58.040> four<00:02:58.220> thousand

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
also gonna call the four thousand

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.890 
also gonna call the four thousand
millionth<00:02:58.760> hour<00:02:58.909> battery<00:02:59.209> which<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.599> gonna<00:02:59.810> be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
millionth hour battery which is gonna be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.539 
millionth hour battery which is gonna be
a<00:02:59.930> non<00:03:00.109> removable<00:03:00.349> battery<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.400> looks

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
a non removable battery and it looks

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.920 
a non removable battery and it looks
like<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:01.760> back<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:01.970> also<00:03:02.389> me<00:03:02.569> non<00:03:02.690> removable

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
like the back is also me non removable

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.629 
like the back is also me non removable
so<00:03:03.349> you'll<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.620> able<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.889> stick<00:03:04.190> your<00:03:04.340> microSD

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
so you'll be able to stick your microSD

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.250 
so you'll be able to stick your microSD
into<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.180> side<00:03:05.389> along<00:03:05.599> with<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> SIM<00:03:06.019> cards

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
into the side along with the SIM cards

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.680 
into the side along with the SIM cards
and<00:03:06.349> stuff<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:08.120> overall<00:03:08.480> this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
and stuff like that so overall this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.839 
and stuff like that so overall this
phone<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.260> know<00:03:09.829> looks<00:03:10.069> very<00:03:10.250> similar<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.549> z3

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
phone you know looks very similar to z3

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.430 
phone you know looks very similar to z3
I<00:03:11.299> don't<00:03:11.569> really<00:03:11.720> see<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> point<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.319> the

I don't really see a point of the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.930 
I don't really see a point of the
upgrade<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:12.889> have<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.069> z3<00:03:13.220> right<00:03:13.579> now<00:03:13.700> so
