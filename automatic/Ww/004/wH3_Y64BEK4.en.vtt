into<00:00:31.800> today's<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> last<00:00:33.840> year<00:00:34.020> wasn't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
into today's video so last year wasn't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
into today's video so last year wasn't
exactly<00:00:34.920> Ubisoft's<00:00:35.880> best<00:00:36.120> yeah<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
exactly Ubisoft's best yeah but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
exactly Ubisoft's best yeah but
regardless<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.590> still<00:00:37.860> did<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
regardless but you still did have a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
regardless but you still did have a
pretty<00:00:38.430> decent<00:00:39.059> year<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.750> bad<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> if

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
pretty decent year but with bad so if

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
pretty decent year but with bad so if
they<00:00:40.500> did<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.980> their<00:00:41.219> ups<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.550> downs<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
they did have their ups and downs of a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.209 
they did have their ups and downs of a
main<00:00:42.390> reason<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.350> probably<00:00:43.559> due<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
main reason for this was probably due to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
main reason for this was probably due to
the<00:00:44.460> amount<00:00:44.730> against<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.390> were<00:00:45.510> putting<00:00:45.750> out

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the amount against they were putting out

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
the amount against they were putting out
there<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.800> example<00:00:47.340> firstly<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> had

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
there for example firstly we had

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.029 
there for example firstly we had
watchdogs<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.289> gonna<00:00:49.500> lie<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.010> was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
watchdogs and I'm not gonna lie that was

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
watchdogs and I'm not gonna lie that was
a<00:00:50.160> critical<00:00:50.850> game<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> rate<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a critical game and if I had to rate it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
a critical game and if I had to rate it
on<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> scale<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.309> ten<00:00:53.699> I'd<00:00:53.879> probably<00:00:54.090> give

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
on a scale one to ten I'd probably give

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
on a scale one to ten I'd probably give
an<00:00:54.780> eight<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> point<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.670> game

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
an eight but the point is with this game

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
an eight but the point is with this game
after<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.570> play<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> campaign<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.829> played<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
after you play the campaign and played a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
after you play the campaign and played a
few<00:00:59.250> games<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.850> friends<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.449> got

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
few games with your friends it got

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
few games with your friends it got
pretty<00:01:00.960> boring<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.219> opinion

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pretty boring but that's just my opinion

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.170 
pretty boring but that's just my opinion
but<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.930> died<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.199> pretty<00:01:04.680> quick<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
but I think it died out pretty quick the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
but I think it died out pretty quick the
game<00:01:06.390> lasted<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> month<00:01:07.619> or<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they had just done so much more to it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
they had just done so much more to it
like<00:01:32.909> updated<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.930> seasonal<00:01:34.560> back

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like updated it with do seasonal back

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
like updated it with do seasonal back
good<00:01:34.950> stuff<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> wouldn't<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.000> died

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
good stuff because it wouldn't have died

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.140 
good stuff because it wouldn't have died
out<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.659> quickly<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.799> firstly<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> big

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
out so quickly so firstly that was a big

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
out so quickly so firstly that was a big
mistake<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.990> Ubisoft<00:01:40.500> made<00:01:40.740> back

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
mistake that I think Ubisoft made back

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
mistake that I think Ubisoft made back
in<00:01:41.030> 2014<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.390> something<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.899> hope

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
in 2014 and that's something that I hope

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
in 2014 and that's something that I hope
they<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> games<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
they don't do with any of the games this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
they don't do with any of the games this
year<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> course<00:01:46.590> after<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.399> had

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
year now of course after that we had

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and hope that they kind of redeem

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.499 
and hope that they kind of redeem
themselves<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.250> watchdogs<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
themselves from watchdogs but that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.350 
themselves from watchdogs but that
wasn't<00:01:57.990> exactly<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.680> case<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.729> going<00:02:00.090> over

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
Assassin's Creed unity it was delay so

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.849 
Assassin's Creed unity it was delay so
it<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.579> be<00:02:29.700> polished<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:30.719> even<00:02:31.109> then<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.650> was

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
it can be polished but even then it was

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.099 
it can be polished but even then it was
still<00:02:32.189> kind<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.639> glitchy<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.959> had

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
still kind of glitchy then we had

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.289 
still kind of glitchy then we had
kinetic<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.799> said<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.340> enough<00:02:35.579> time<00:02:35.819> into

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
kinetic you said put enough time into

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.059 
kinetic you said put enough time into
making<00:02:36.419> Assassin's<00:02:37.169> Creed<00:02:37.409> instead<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> doing

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
making Assassin's Creed instead of doing

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.009 
making Assassin's Creed instead of doing
it<00:02:38.430> every<00:02:38.819> year<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.689> something<00:02:39.840> that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
it every year and this is something that

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.899 
it every year and this is something that
I<00:02:40.139> really<00:02:40.469> wish<00:02:40.829> you'd<00:02:41.069> be<00:02:41.189> soft<00:02:41.430> will<00:02:41.639> stop

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
know after Assassin's Creed unity was

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.679 
know after Assassin's Creed unity was
released<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.219> new<00:02:47.489> assassin's<00:02:48.209> creed<00:02:48.480> game

released the new assassin's creed game

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.689 
released the new assassin's creed game
was<00:02:48.989> league<00:02:49.260> literally<00:02:49.889> in<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.219> same<00:02:50.250> week

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:50.699 
was league literally in the same week

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.339 
was league literally in the same week
and<00:02:50.909> it's<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.359> called<00:02:51.569> Assassin's

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
and it's going to be called Assassin's

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.069 
and it's going to be called Assassin's
Creed<00:02:52.709> victory<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.699> there<00:02:54.329> were<00:02:54.449> screenshots

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
Creed victory and there were screenshots

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.869 
Creed victory and there were screenshots
and<00:02:55.169> everything<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.949> it<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.219> it's<00:02:56.250> definitely

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
and everything for it so it's definitely

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.520 
and everything for it so it's definitely
in<00:02:57.150> development<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.959> does<00:02:58.109> look<00:02:58.319> pretty

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
in development and it does look pretty

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.409 
in development and it does look pretty
cool<00:02:58.889> but<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.159> main<00:02:59.340> question<00:02:59.370> is<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.359> it

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
cool but the main question is is it

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.569 
cool but the main question is is it
going<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.109> turn<00:03:01.290> out<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.799> Assassin's<00:03:02.370> Creed

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
going to turn out like Assassin's Creed

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.909

some<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.370> their<00:03:20.519> best<00:03:20.699> series<00:03:21.329> for<00:03:21.810> example

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
some of their best series for example

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.199 
some of their best series for example
Assassin's<00:03:22.919> Creed<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.400> again<00:03:23.729> this<00:03:24.030> is

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
Assassin's Creed and again this is

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.849 
Assassin's Creed and again this is
something<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.599> strongly<00:03:25.019> agree<00:03:25.349> with

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
something that I strongly agree with

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.890 
something that I strongly agree with
because<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.699> definitely<00:03:27.030> without<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.780> doubt

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
because it is definitely without a doubt

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.229 
because it is definitely without a doubt
one<00:03:28.259> of<00:03:28.319> their<00:03:28.560> best<00:03:28.799> series<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.639> we're<00:03:29.790> ever

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
one of their best series but we're ever

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.539 
one of their best series but we're ever
going<00:03:30.599> now<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.109> feel<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.650> probably<00:03:32.069> not<00:03:32.370> going

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
going now I feel it's probably not going

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.159 
going now I feel it's probably not going
to<00:03:32.759> last<00:03:32.879> about<00:03:33.090> long<00:03:33.449> because<00:03:33.840> eventually

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
to last about long because eventually

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.689 
to last about long because eventually
they're<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.159> run<00:03:35.340> out<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.549> ideas

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
they're going to run out of ideas

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.089 
they're going to run out of ideas
whereas<00:03:36.689> if<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:37.199> were<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.590> release<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.069> new

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
whereas if they were to release a new

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.039 
whereas if they were to release a new
assassins<00:03:38.759> free<00:03:38.939> game<00:03:39.180> every<00:03:39.659> two<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:40.019> three

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
assassins free game every two or three

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.259 
assassins free game every two or three
years<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.709> could<00:03:41.009> understand<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.759> because<00:03:41.970> it

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
years I could understand that because it

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.449 
years I could understand that because it
will<00:03:42.419> last<00:03:42.659> longer<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.409> they<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:43.949> more<00:03:44.159> time

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
will last longer and they have more time

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.759 
will last longer and they have more time
to<00:03:44.699> polish<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.209> game<00:03:45.239> up<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.959> add<00:03:46.139> more<00:03:46.379> ideas

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
to polish the game up and add more ideas

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.890 
to polish the game up and add more ideas
and<00:03:46.829> all<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.220> good<00:03:47.430> stuff<00:03:47.599> then<00:03:48.599> we<00:03:48.750> had

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and all that good stuff then we had

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.050 
and all that good stuff then we had
bogan<00:03:49.409> who<00:03:49.590> said<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.069> want<00:03:50.340> them<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.699> make<00:03:50.879> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
bogan who said I want them to make the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.089 
bogan who said I want them to make the
game<00:03:51.299> look<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:51.780> good<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.199> trailer<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.859> I

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
game look as good of a trailer and I

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.249 
game look as good of a trailer and I
think<00:03:53.489> far<00:03:53.790> cry<00:03:54.090> 4<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.569> Assassin's<00:03:55.049> Creed

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259 
think far cry 4 and Assassin's Creed

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.499 
think far cry 4 and Assassin's Creed
unity<00:03:55.290> did<00:03:55.919> do<00:03:56.189> this<00:03:56.489> especially<00:03:56.819> if<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.329> take

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
unity did do this especially if you take

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.119 
unity did do this especially if you take
away<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.019> bugs<00:03:58.229> from<00:03:58.409> Assassin's<00:03:58.949> Creed

now first of all with four three three
and<00:04:20.020> four<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.710> heard<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.920> lot<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.190> people<00:04:21.580> saying

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
going to disagree with this a little bit

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.960 
going to disagree with this a little bit
because<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.830> think<00:04:26.860> about<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.730> was<00:04:27.790> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
because if you think about it it was a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.000 
because if you think about it it was a
completely<00:04:28.480> different<00:04:29.140> map<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.590> was<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> lot

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
completely different map it was a lot

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.280 
completely different map it was a lot
denser<00:04:30.280> there<00:04:31.090> were<00:04:31.210> so<00:04:31.420> many<00:04:31.600> different<00:04:31.900> cool

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
denser there were so many different cool

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.660 
denser there were so many different cool
things<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.710> we<00:04:32.890> could<00:04:33.040> try<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:33.430> we

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
things that we could try it but we

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.670 
things that we could try it but we
couldn't<00:04:33.970> invoke<00:04:34.300> referee<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.440> course

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
couldn't invoke referee and of course
