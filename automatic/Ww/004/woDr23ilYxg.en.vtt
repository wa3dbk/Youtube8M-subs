interestingly<00:03:24.150> enough<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:25.349> could<00:03:25.470> make<00:03:25.620> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
interestingly enough you could make a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.979 
interestingly enough you could make a
case<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.579> markets<00:03:27.060> with<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.419> close<00:03:27.720> above

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
case that the markets with a close above

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.960 
case that the markets with a close above
13,000<00:03:28.769> 3,000<00:03:29.250> on<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.400> Nasdaq<00:03:29.730> could

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
13,000 3,000 on the Nasdaq could

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.280 
13,000 3,000 on the Nasdaq could
continue<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.389> see<00:03:30.629> highs<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.109> very

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
continue to see highs and it's very

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.869 
continue to see highs and it's very
possible<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.739> see<00:03:31.919> another<00:03:32.010> gap<00:03:32.340> up<00:03:32.549> tomorrow

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
possible we see another gap up tomorrow

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.189 
possible we see another gap up tomorrow
frankly<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.449> think<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> good

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
frankly I think that is a good

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.539 
frankly I think that is a good
possibility<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:34.889> tomorrow's<00:03:35.250> whipsaw

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
possibility but tomorrow's whipsaw

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.250 
possibility but tomorrow's whipsaw
Wednesday<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.150> we'll<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.629> how<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.810> end<00:03:37.079> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
Wednesday and we'll see how we end the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.990 
Wednesday and we'll see how we end the
day<00:03:37.440> tomorrow<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:38.099> think<00:03:38.549> we're<00:03:38.639> on<00:03:38.699> the<00:03:38.760> last

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
day tomorrow I think we're on the last

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.699 
day tomorrow I think we're on the last
legs<00:03:39.359> here<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.690> market<00:03:40.019> again<00:03:40.139> that's

top<00:05:06.449> which<00:05:06.599> I<00:05:06.690> just<00:05:06.840> put<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.169> trend<00:05:07.440> line

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
top which I just put in that trend line

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.110 
top which I just put in that trend line
it<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.830> finding<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> little<00:05:08.759> bit<00:05:08.849> of<00:05:08.909> resistance

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
it is finding a little bit of resistance

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.700 
it is finding a little bit of resistance
but<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.509> more<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.720> hammer<00:05:10.020> on<00:05:10.199> this<00:05:10.349> level<00:05:10.560> it

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
but the more you hammer on this level it

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.890 
but the more you hammer on this level it
is<00:05:10.740> possible<00:05:11.310> we<00:05:11.669> could<00:05:11.880> see<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.090> pop<00:05:12.330> through

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
is possible we could see a pop through

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.779 
is possible we could see a pop through
that<00:05:13.110> i'm<00:05:13.740> also<00:05:13.919> watching<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.460> see<00:05:14.580> if<00:05:14.610> the

that i'm also watching to see if the

that i'm also watching to see if the
candle<00:05:15.150> closes<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.659> if<00:05:15.720> we<00:05:15.840> get<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:15.990> topping

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
candle closes and if we get a topping

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.809 
candle closes and if we get a topping
tale<00:05:16.770> here<00:05:16.979> which<00:05:17.099> will<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.310> reversal

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
tale here which will be a reversal

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.570 
tale here which will be a reversal
signal<00:05:18.000> off<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.409> Fed<00:05:19.620> move<00:05:19.860> especially<00:05:20.280> the

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.350 
decision which again we just got 15
minutes<00:05:25.199> ago<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:25.650> usually<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.909> move<00:05:27.120> one

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360

minutes ago you usually get a move one
way<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.659> then<00:05:27.720> a<00:05:27.810> possible<00:05:28.229> reversal<00:05:28.680> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
way and then a possible reversal the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.930 
way and then a possible reversal the
other<00:05:28.919> way<00:05:29.039> we'll<00:05:29.220> see<00:05:29.370> if<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.490> comes<00:05:29.759> into

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
other way we'll see if that comes into

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.730 
other way we'll see if that comes into
play<00:05:30.150> here<00:05:30.180> I'm<00:05:30.509> looking<00:05:30.900> for<00:05:31.199> the<00:05:31.259> signal<00:05:31.650> of

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
play here I'm looking for the signal of

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.320 
play here I'm looking for the signal of
it<00:05:31.889> before<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.370> would<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.610> anything<00:05:32.909> now<00:05:33.150> if<00:05:33.240> we

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
it before I would do anything now if we

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.580 
it before I would do anything now if we
got<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> topping<00:05:33.870> tail<00:05:34.020> here<00:05:34.199> yeah<00:05:34.349> I'd<00:05:34.440> be

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
got a topping tail here yeah I'd be

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.050 
got a topping tail here yeah I'd be
tempted<00:05:34.770> but<00:05:35.039> right<00:05:35.219> now<00:05:35.340> it's<00:05:35.490> not<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.669> topping

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
tempted but right now it's not a topping

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.700 
tempted but right now it's not a topping
tail<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.840> would<00:05:36.960> have<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> close<00:05:37.380> in<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.590> lower

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
tail it would have to close in the lower

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.499 
tail it would have to close in the lower
twenty-five<00:05:38.159> percent<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.729> candle<00:05:39.150> which

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
twenty-five percent of the candle which

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.180 
twenty-five percent of the candle which
again<00:05:39.719> we<00:05:39.870> have<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.110> see<00:05:40.259> a<00:05:40.289> close<00:05:40.590> probably<00:05:41.070> in

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
again we have to see a close probably in

topping tail and play all right doesn't
look<00:05:46.800> like<00:05:46.949> it's<00:05:47.070> going<00:05:47.099> to<00:05:47.219> do<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.460> thus<00:05:47.610> far

case of your trend line right here and I
didn't<00:06:13.469> draw<00:06:13.560> that<00:06:13.590> exactly<00:06:14.250> on<00:06:14.400> there<00:06:14.550> let's

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
didn't draw that exactly on there let's

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.939 
didn't draw that exactly on there let's
do<00:06:14.969> it<00:06:15.090> as<00:06:15.240> accurately<00:06:16.139> as<00:06:16.289> possible<00:06:16.349> and

between here now ultimately this will

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.170 
between here now ultimately this will
break<00:06:20.099> one<00:06:20.310> way<00:06:20.430> or<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.550> other<00:06:20.610> whichever<00:06:21.030> way

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.279 
break one way or the other whichever way
it<00:06:21.270> breaks<00:06:21.419> you<00:06:21.569> can<00:06:21.690> actually<00:06:21.840> have<00:06:22.050> a<00:06:22.110> pretty
