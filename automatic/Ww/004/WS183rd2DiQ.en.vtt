attitude which gave the drink a lovely

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
attitude which gave the drink a lovely
baby<00:01:02.039> peach<00:01:02.370> color<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:04.140> definitely<00:01:04.439> gonna

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
baby peach color it's definitely gonna

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
baby peach color it's definitely gonna
need<00:01:04.710> sugar<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.159> sweeten<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> peaches<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
need sugar to sweeten up the peaches and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
need sugar to sweeten up the peaches and
it<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.720> depends<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.409> ripeness<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it really depends on the ripeness of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
it really depends on the ripeness of the
peaches<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.479> gonna<00:01:09.600> need

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
peaches for this so there's gonna need

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.460 
peaches for this so there's gonna need
at<00:01:09.990> least<00:01:10.020> three<00:01:10.979> teaspoons<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.490> sugar

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
at least three teaspoons of sugar

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
at least three teaspoons of sugar
so<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> sugar<00:01:14.520> goes<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.000> top<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.300> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so the sugar goes in on top of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
so the sugar goes in on top of the
peaches<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.620> we<00:01:16.770> give<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> mixture<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
peaches and then we give the mixture a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.140 
peaches and then we give the mixture a
serious<00:01:18.090> blitz

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.820 

it's<00:01:25.720> important<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.170> grind<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> peaches<00:01:26.620> down

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
it's important to grind the peaches down

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's important to grind the peaches down
really<00:01:27.100> well<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.330> fridge<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:28.690> have<00:01:28.810> my
