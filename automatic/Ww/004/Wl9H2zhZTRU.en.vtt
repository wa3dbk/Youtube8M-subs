00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.029
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.370
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.260
 I will tell you about how and how 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.260
 fertilize fruit trees properly 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 fruit trees especially entered 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 the fruiting phase consume huge 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.670
 amount of nutrients which 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.470
 come from the soil as aqueous solutions 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.109
 over time, the soils naturally become poorer and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.630
 gardeners are all well aware that stocks 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.030
 and so they need to replenish soil 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
 do it in two ways or 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.630
 organic fertilizer or 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 mineral fertilizers can be and in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 complex and organic and mineral and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.879
 Organic fertilizers are all aware 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 this bird droppings on wax pastore everything 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 This gardeners have long been used here 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420
 They began to produce such specially 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.110
 packaged 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 concentrated and organic 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 fertilizers that need to be diluted with water and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 already fertilize them with plants and in general 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 organic fertilizers 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.859
 most appropriate to apply because 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.690
 that they contain the entire list 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.880
 the substances necessary for the plant 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 improve soil condition and make them 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 more loose more available for 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 air penetration improves it 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 structure mineral fertilizer which 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.000
 apply in gardening and their from 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.189
 destination is to deliver 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
 the plant needs and specific 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 substance main substances which 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 nitrogen potassium phosphorus major suppliers 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.680
 nitrogen 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.000
 fertilizers like ammonium nitrate 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 carbonite or urea as often 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 call the main supplier under soon 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 This superphosphate probably all gardeners 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.340
 I know what it is and the main 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.280
 provider 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 gauge called potassium salt can and 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.609
 others usually fertilize 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.869
 make in two doses 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.030
 this is spring and autumn and spring to the plant 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.310
 usually more is required 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.369
 nitrogen fertilizers that cause growth 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.799
 enhanced but approximate dose of nitrogen 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.819
 fertilizer 20-35 grams per square meter 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.500
 the wheel is natural if 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.929
 very poor soil can be a little bit 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.729
 increase but stick to those 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.510
 recommendations that are listed here on 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.610
 packaging 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.799
 and in the autumn when the tree is preparing for winter 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.239
 when buds are laid already for the future 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.819
 year is usually paid 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.250
 it is fertilizer containing phosphorus and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.630
 fertilizer containing skid wheels and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.510
 fertilizers in the second half of the summer already 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.610
 no one makes why nitrogen fertilizer 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.769
 causes active growth of shoots 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 do not have time to mature and, accordingly 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.790
 freeze in winter the main amount 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.250
 fertilizers are applied in the fall of potash and 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.470
 phosphorus compost organic manure 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.510
 fertilizer is usually brought in the fall 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.400
 gardeners do scatter so 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 fertilizer on a pristvolny circle then 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 dig up digging about on the floor 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.970
 20- centimeter spade bayonet 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.590
 here we took a well-rotted manure 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.359
 when I say to you is meant 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.489
 well rotted in no case 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.840
 fresh manure is not a drink and that's 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.209
 so on pristvolnom circle we 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.000
 scatter but quantity naturally 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 this manure depends on the size of the tree 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 usually per square meter 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.150
 the circle 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.549
 a bucket and a half well rotted manure 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.709
 or a good rich compost poured out 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.989
 and then we start digging not the head 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.299
 would not be deep 20 centimeters on the shovel 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.849
 turning over and after the winter rains 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.680
 after the snows it's all about substance 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.360
 will quietly enter the soil 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.840
 plant roots 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.480
 on the perimeter of the crown projection is done 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.750
 groove so shovels and the earth to a depth 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.510
 also 20 centimeters can be 30 and you're here 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.600
 this groove is now at the bottom we lay 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.820
 half dose of autumn fertilizer 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 half the dose if you stack 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.500
 organic manure compost manure 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.060
 about half a bucket in the bottom of his 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.890
 fertilize and say superphosphate 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.070
 phosphate fertilizers are applied approximately 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.240
 half a glass a meter running 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.240
 this hole 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.910
 after you deposit half here 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.250
 norms 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.110
 This fertilizer needs to be mixed. 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.910
 ground so that it spread so 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.550
 more or less evenly in this hole 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.250
 inside the hole now cover this hole 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.850
 the land that they gave us from her and 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.230
 in the same way pour the rest here 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.690
 half of our rate 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.790
 I show the example of mineral 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.250
 fertilizer just down from the manure 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.620
 composting is done in the same way 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.419
 the top layer is mixed with your 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.550
 fertilizer with this method 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.070
 fertilization when you're in the hole 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.720
 wear first half the norm then 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.979
 stir and the earth is still full of evenness 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.600
 you have it more evenly 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.220
 distributed over the whole trunk 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.510
 circle the roots of the plant will not be burned and plus 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.490
 plants root system develops but 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.560
 goes beyond its so to speak 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.690
 crown and gets just here in 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.150
 the fertile land that you just 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.470
 convenient besides the main fertilizer very 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.350
 effective for fruit trees 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.479
 use the so-called top dressing well 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.180
 these are fast-acting substances therefore 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.350
 it acts quickly enough especially 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.419
 effectively if suddenly for some 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.980
 reasons you didn't feed the tree in spring 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.960
 new to 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.520
 or what you need to do for this 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.950
 prepare the so-called slurry 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.810
 take a big barrel on the third score 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.000
 manure pour water let stand 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.270
 a few days carefully mixing everything 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.790
 this 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.010
 and here is this liquid 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.810
 concentrated then dilute in 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.130
 five times if chicken litter used 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.620
 Dilute 10 times 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.650
 and here with this solution you spill the hole 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.420
 around the tree besides such here 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.010
 fertilizing organic can be used and 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.530
 mineral substances let's say here 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.210
 ammonium nitrate nitrogen fertilizer 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.830
 about a tablespoon per 10 liters per 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.630
 a bucket of water to dissolve and in the same way 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.290
 trunk circle lulochku neatly 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.760
 flooded 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.860
 of course after such a fertilizer 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.050
 it is desirable to water the substance 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.390
 distributed throughout the root system 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.340
 in addition to standard fertilizers and dressings 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.350
 through the root system enough 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.650
 effective proven 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.470
 top dressing through foliar foliage 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.570
 feeding is best to use 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.660
 let's say nitrogen fertilizer urea 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.090
 in the spring on the leaves spray about 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.370
 30 grams per bucket of water dilute it 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.410
 and already in the month of August in order to 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.180
 you are better for having laid buds for the future 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.480
 year can use let's say 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.610
 superphosphate somewhere 100 150 grams on 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.440
 a bucket of water is dissolved and sprayed and in 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.790
 also on the leaves of course is 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.680
 pestering is better to do phosphoric 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:26.440
 weather or late afternoon when the sun 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.390
 no longer scorches so today he talked about 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.920
 tom how to fertilize fruit 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.260
 trees and how to fertilize properly 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.610
 fruit trees the most important thing is that you 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.120
 must remember nitrogen fertilizer 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.340
 apply exactly in the spring to the middle 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.449
 summer and already phosphate and potash in 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.370
 the second half of summer and autumn 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.590
 on this i say goodbye to you see our 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.389
 video plots and even better subscribe to 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.479
