how to replace cartridge brake pads on a
road<00:00:21.619> bike<00:00:21.830> there's<00:00:22.160> a<00:00:22.190> few<00:00:22.369> things<00:00:22.520> to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
road bike there's a few things to

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.840 
road bike there's a few things to
consider<00:00:23.140> before<00:00:24.140> you<00:00:24.289> get<00:00:24.440> started<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.670> as

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
consider before you get started and as

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.300 
consider before you get started and as
you're<00:00:26.000> doing<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.330> job<00:00:26.359> one<00:00:27.050> thing<00:00:27.260> is<00:00:27.529> if

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
you're doing the job one thing is if

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.870 
you're doing the job one thing is if
your<00:00:28.939> pads<00:00:29.150> are<00:00:29.359> pretty<00:00:29.539> worn<00:00:29.869> then<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:31.730> will

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
your pads are pretty worn then you will

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.819 
your pads are pretty worn then you will
probably<00:00:32.000> have<00:00:32.300> compensated<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.649> width

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
probably have compensated for the width

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.979 
probably have compensated for the width
between<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.309> pads<00:00:34.550> with<00:00:34.910> your<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.690> barrel

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
between the pads with your the barrel

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.680 
between the pads with your the barrel
adjuster<00:00:36.110> or<00:00:36.910> with<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.059> brake<00:00:38.239> cable<00:00:38.420> anchor

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
adjuster or with the brake cable anchor

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.840 
adjuster or with the brake cable anchor
bolt<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.890> those<00:00:40.309> are<00:00:40.399> going<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.550> come<00:00:40.670> into

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
bolt so those are going to come into

bolt so those are going to come into
play<00:00:41.059> as<00:00:41.270> we<00:00:41.450> replace<00:00:41.690> as<00:00:41.989> we<00:00:42.320> replace<00:00:42.590> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
play as we replace as we replace the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.380 
play as we replace as we replace the
pads<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.190> first<00:00:43.790> thing<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:43.940> want<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.149> do<00:00:44.270> is

pads so first thing you want to do is

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.979 
pads so first thing you want to do is
remove<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:44.809> old<00:00:44.840> pads<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.840> it's<00:00:47.840> usually

remove the old pads and it's usually

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.830 
remove the old pads and it's usually
somewhere<00:00:48.829> between<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.270> one<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.420> half<00:00:50.450> to

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
somewhere between a one and a half to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.560 
somewhere between a one and a half to
two<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:51.170> half<00:00:51.260> millimeter<00:00:51.739> allen<00:00:52.570> bolt

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
two and a half millimeter allen bolt

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.270 
two and a half millimeter allen bolt
that<00:00:53.809> holds<00:00:53.840> them<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:54.739> just<00:00:54.980> remove<00:00:55.250> that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
that holds them in so just remove that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.869 
that holds them in so just remove that
bolt<00:00:55.610> set<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.660> aside<00:00:56.980> new<00:00:57.980> pads<00:00:58.250> come<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:58.730> new

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
bolt set it aside new pads come with new

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.119 
bolt set it aside new pads come with new
bolts<00:00:59.239> they<00:00:59.899> have<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.170> little<00:01:00.739> bit<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.920> thread

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
bolts they have a little bit of thread

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.709 
bolts they have a little bit of thread
locking<00:01:01.399> on<00:01:01.670> them<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:02.239> they<00:01:02.360> stay<00:01:02.600> in

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
locking on them so that they stay in

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.590 
locking on them so that they stay in
place<00:01:03.549> so<00:01:04.549> you'll<00:01:04.699> want<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.879> use<00:01:05.179> the<00:01:05.359> new

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
place so you'll want to use the new

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.349 
place so you'll want to use the new
bolts<00:01:05.840> instead<00:01:06.799> of<00:01:06.979> reusing<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.639> old<00:01:07.670> bolt<00:01:08.029> so

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
bolts instead of reusing the old bolt so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.059 
bolts instead of reusing the old bolt so
once<00:01:08.569> that<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:09.020> out<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.380> there<00:01:09.679> then<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.039> can

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
once that is out of there then you can

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.980 
once that is out of there then you can
just<00:01:10.340> slide<00:01:10.459> the<00:01:10.729> cartridge<00:01:10.999> out<00:01:11.359> of<00:01:11.689> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
just slide the cartridge out of the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.239 
just slide the cartridge out of the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
or as on the front brake for that matter

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.779 
or as on the front brake for that matter
it's<00:01:18.319> going<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.529> slide<00:01:18.709> out<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.069> rear<00:01:19.459> rear

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
it's going to slide out of the rear rear

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.779 
it's going to slide out of the rear rear
of<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.969> pad<00:01:20.209> holder<00:01:20.569> so<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:21.709> can<00:01:21.889> do<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:22.159> with

wrench you use to remove the pad bolt

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.440 
wrench you use to remove the pad bolt
but<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:31.189> put<00:01:31.579> some<00:01:31.759> pressure<00:01:31.909> on<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
but you just put some pressure on the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.839 
but you just put some pressure on the
front<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.779> brake<00:01:32.959> pad<00:01:33.639> cartridge<00:01:34.639> and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.299 
the the barrel adjuster just go ahead
and<00:02:04.849> back<00:02:05.029> that<00:02:05.239> out<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.109> it<00:02:06.289> lets<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.919> caliper

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:07.309 
and back that out so it lets the caliper

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:10.899 
and back that out so it lets the caliper
open<00:02:07.549> back<00:02:07.700> up<00:02:07.880> again<00:02:08.209> or<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:10.280> that's<00:02:10.549> not<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
open back up again or if that's not the

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.399 
open back up again or if that's not the
case<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.269> you've<00:02:11.420> actually<00:02:11.569> adjusted<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
case and you've actually adjusted the

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.500 
case and you've actually adjusted the
anchor<00:02:12.739> bolt<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.459> take<00:02:13.640> tension

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
anchor bolt to take tension

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.780 
anchor bolt to take tension
put<00:02:15.260> tension<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.740> cable<00:02:15.890> go<00:02:16.550> ahead<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
put tension on the cable go ahead and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
put tension on the cable go ahead and
loosen<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.260> let<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.380> caliper<00:02:18.739> open<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.160> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
loosen that up let the caliper open up a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.820 
loosen that up let the caliper open up a
bit<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.730> snug<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.540> back<00:02:20.690> down<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.680> once

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
bit and snug it back down and then once

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.410 
bit and snug it back down and then once
you<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> brake<00:02:22.310> pads<00:02:22.580> installed<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.300> may

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
you get the brake pads installed you may

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.020 
you get the brake pads installed you may
need<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.750> fine-tune<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:25.819> take<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
need to fine-tune that so just take the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.390 
need to fine-tune that so just take the
new<00:02:26.180> pad<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:27.110> reverse<00:02:27.410> what<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.980> did<00:02:28.160> when

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
new pad just reverse what you did when

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.490 
new pad just reverse what you did when
you<00:02:28.489> took<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.730> out<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> left<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.410> right

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
you took it out there's a left and right

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
you took it out there's a left and right
you'll<00:02:31.069> notice<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.550> there's<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> slot<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.390> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
you'll notice that there's a slot in the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.190 
you'll notice that there's a slot in the
pad<00:02:32.750> where<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.310> bolt<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.660> pad<00:02:35.870> holder

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
pad where the bolt and the pad holder

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.100 
pad where the bolt and the pad holder
goes<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.370> hold<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.730> place<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.270> you'll

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
goes in to hold it in place so you'll

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.290 
goes in to hold it in place so you'll
want<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.470> slot<00:02:39.920> lined<00:02:40.280> up<00:02:40.580> with<00:02:41.000> where<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
want that slot lined up with where the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.240 
want that slot lined up with where the
bolt<00:02:41.480> goes<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.989> at<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.709> rear<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> brake

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
bolt goes in at the rear of the brake

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.300 
bolt goes in at the rear of the brake
pad<00:02:43.489> holder<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.050> get<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:45.920> groove

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310

then replace the pad holder bolt with
the<00:02:53.900> new<00:02:54.140> one<00:02:54.519> once<00:02:55.519> you've<00:02:55.780> tightened<00:02:56.780> that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the new one once you've tightened that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.050 
the new one once you've tightened that
up<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.200> torque<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.920> want<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.280> make<00:02:59.030> sure

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
up to torque then you want to make sure

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.440 
up to torque then you want to make sure
that<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.390> pads<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.810> alignment<00:03:00.380> with<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.069> rim

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
that the pads in alignment with the rim

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.270 
that the pads in alignment with the rim
key<00:03:02.450> things<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.780> want<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.080> note<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.440> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
key things you want to note is that the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.970 
key things you want to note is that the
top<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.730> brake<00:03:04.940> pad<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.650> parallel<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
top of the brake pad is parallel to the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.220 
top of the brake pad is parallel to the
rim<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.519> about<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> millimeter<00:03:08.569> below<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> top

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
rim and about a millimeter below the top

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.320 
rim and about a millimeter below the top
of<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.440> rim<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.549> you're<00:03:10.850> not<00:03:11.000> anywhere

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
of the rim so that you're not anywhere

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.420 
of the rim so that you're not anywhere
close<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.900> tire<00:03:12.140> as<00:03:12.410> these<00:03:12.980> brake<00:03:13.220> pads

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
close to the tire as these brake pads

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.930 
close to the tire as these brake pads
are<00:03:13.670> compressed<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.010> also<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.700> want<00:03:16.850> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
are compressed and also if you want to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.729 
are compressed and also if you want to
adjust<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.510> toe<00:03:17.690> end<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.260> brake<00:03:18.440> pad<00:03:18.470> at

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
adjust the toe end of the brake pad at

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.069 
adjust the toe end of the brake pad at
this<00:03:18.890> point<00:03:19.160> it's<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> good<00:03:19.400> time<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.840> toe-in

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
this point it's a good time the toe-in

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.140 
this point it's a good time the toe-in
is<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.250> front<00:03:22.609> part<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:22.970> brake

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
is so that the front part of the brake

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.560 
is so that the front part of the brake
pad<00:03:23.180> hits<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> rim<00:03:23.989> first<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:25.730> maybe<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.090> gap

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
pad hits the rim first with maybe a gap

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.240 
pad hits the rim first with maybe a gap
on<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.380> rear<00:03:27.530> part<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.890> brake<00:03:28.070> pad

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
on the on the rear part of the brake pad

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.190 
on the on the rear part of the brake pad
of<00:03:28.340> about<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.579> millimeter<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:30.049> going

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
of about a millimeter what that's going

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.069 
of about a millimeter what that's going
to<00:03:30.260> do<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:31.540> your<00:03:32.540> brakes<00:03:32.750> are<00:03:32.840> going<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.019> be

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
to do is your brakes are going to be

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.699 
to do is your brakes are going to be
less<00:03:33.230> noisy<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.780> less<00:03:35.780> chattery<00:03:36.230> if<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.590> do

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
less noisy and less chattery if you do

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.250 
less noisy and less chattery if you do
that<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:38.510> ahead<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.750> do<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.870> at<00:03:39.109> this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
that so go ahead and do that at this

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.940 
that so go ahead and do that at this
time<00:03:39.440> as<00:03:39.620> well

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
time as well

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.740 
time as well
okay<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:41.700> once<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.270> have<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.450> new<00:03:42.540> brake

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
okay so once you have the new brake

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
okay so once you have the new brake
cartridge<00:03:43.170> pad<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> adjust

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
cartridge pad in and you want to adjust

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.809 
cartridge pad in and you want to adjust
the<00:03:44.520> toe-in<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> brake<00:03:45.300> pad<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:47.490> loosen

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
the toe-in on the brake pad you loosen

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.480 
the toe-in on the brake pad you loosen
the<00:03:47.940> main<00:03:48.120> pad<00:03:49.080> anchor<00:03:49.380> bolt<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.770> you'll<00:03:50.130> have

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
the main pad anchor bolt and you'll have
