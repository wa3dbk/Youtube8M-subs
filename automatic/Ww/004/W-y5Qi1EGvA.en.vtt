00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.250
 so are aboard the kanata bus of the snsm does not hold 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.339
 so what can you say what are the characteristics of 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.779
 of this case note 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.559
 so the lifeboat is true it keeps saying that our lady of 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.140
 bonecours reaches only the two of us 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.079
 bangkok - goal is all the time 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.169
 the 17 9 60 years for all 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.640
 from his computer the leader against a background of growth in France 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.360
 the speed of play 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.850
 bern 21 hours in good conditions 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.410
 and so it is only 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.980
 back in grace to return to 6-6 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.550
 only on blogs or martine intervention websites 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.790
 any type of intervention for the blackcurrant time will be happier 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.680
 the faculty the example 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.970
 on Sunday 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 Saturday night the blue week 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
 the marseille will be closer 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 Los Angeles 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.760
 they are soluble tv so we intervened vandals 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.370
 a team of divers 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 intervened for 2010 same thing 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.360
 by its size that of the mayor 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 when did you apply the heavy debt? 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.430
 in all three cases pity 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 and during the redesign of the every 15 years 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.340
 in july had in june this effect in june 2010 why 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.800
 you chose for its protection 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 twitter confronted for a long time 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.360
 problems both in club and selection 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.330
 as for the rescue on the problems of 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 boat fairing that is still in full trouble 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.090
 it's a bad time to pass 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 for results that are more and more random and more 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.130
 it is obvious that it will be necessary 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 currently 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.790
 we have serious problems 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.050
 carbohydrates 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.900
 at the level of the hull they are who become after a few months 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.560
 catastrophic 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.509
 did you notice any differences from the intersections 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.270
 classical 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.580
 this level of fuel at the level of activities also motor or other 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.189
 we found the performance of the boat when internally 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.459
 which was to make sure that construction site 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.759
 and we had lost 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.259
 our roads after 15 years 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.459
 for marcel cocq own coming out of duck market this note 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.920
 when we took the boat on a long enough group approaching Corsica 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.359
 from 150000 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.439
 to go 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.519
 so the boat was 31 to 30 years old at 3 3 three months three four months 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.739
 we had consumed 800 liters of diesel 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.359
 yes back my own body 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.079
 defense at trial 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.619
 I was comforted in this way 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:53.979
 50 pence up 2,500 beds 60 out of 250 miles out of 250 which is huge 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.979
 with the price of diesel which increases novelty it is an important position 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.849
 since a few months it's the third biggest 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.419
 at the rescue level 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.299
 it's for the maintenance of its doors 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.299
 small material is diesel 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.539
 much faster and therefore more expensive 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:10.999
 so with us for wanted 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.999
 the blow the benefits that we can from this side 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.439
 to that it's a job because during the night this procedure which guarantees 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.810
 at least 50 banks out of five about three for conflict of interest said 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.159
 that he could quite unique 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.159
 so we keep the initial hull 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.369
 you're advocating back this lawsuit she's all boss of canadians 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.709
 we see boaters knowing that the erase what a debt 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.359
 some argue that the classic 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.359
 sharp decline of 5% between two cars 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.269
 only the two channels in the Seine-Maritime to each other and is said 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.299
 on their side does so I think that at the level 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.780
 when the redesigns were gradually redone even on our 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.629
 countries will start to think about that to this problem the whole file 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.989
 smith homos 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.509
 joÃ«lle fall on a pleasure boat someone who leaves for a 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.999
 long trip around the world in 3d from the range door to back 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.640
 if the drivers more trouble to net charge 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.430
 on the other hand the poorer and cheaper in mice 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.430
 earlier they can more or less risky eschois 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.639
 poutine cox assaulted 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.069
 it's a nice gift 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.419
 the boat is the trace is the main thing 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.680
 where the most important guy may still be an effort and the engines on the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.590
 barges do not send change the sails 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.400
 so win more 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.099
 a lot is the race 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.509
 good thank you very much done tomorrow q the keywords on the driver and the 5 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.700
 December at 10 am 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.270
 6 and then not a good start end of 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.550
 2 this upward revision and then percent in toronto
