00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.420
 moment clarifying that the issues here 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.160
 I share them and I had already uploaded them 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.320
 previously but as mediafire I 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.480
 canceled the account I could not recover 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.699
 the content of that video so 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.130
 I decided to upload the themes again but with 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.500
 a different personalization that is the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 we open the folder obtained and here 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.250

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.640
