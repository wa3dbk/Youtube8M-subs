00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 Welcome to Hen again we have 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 the misses again with us this 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.779
 The truth is that we received requests 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.570
 of something a craft that was a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.609
 card etcetera but for children more 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 little ones because the crown we made 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 with the masses he was very father but 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 you can also complicate a little 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.600
 to some children then she is brought 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 something that he now makes me very very 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 easy to do and very practical we follow 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.989
 with the theme of the hands is that marisol 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.899
 now going to clinic table but the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.899
 card is not like an accordion in 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.030
 and good it closes again but it 's 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.580
 saying in the child's hands the girl 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.950
 with something that can be put for who 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.140
 is going to go marisol we talk a little bit about 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.879
 this new craft that nothing the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 hands because it's something personal you're 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.780
 giving away a little bit of you even if it's you 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.640
 footprint but already the person when the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.740
 receives is going to say good is not nothing else 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.710
 a paper but also symbol but 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.229
 I work obviously with love then 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.450
 Granny say good aposta like 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.360
 you feel more personalized and apart 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.220
 children also learn to trace and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.210
 others then it's how very complete this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.540
 craft 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 let's start what we need 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.280
 equally colored papers 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.890
 the color that you like 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.010
 scissors 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.570
 of glue on the rules again 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.490
 our little hands that we had already 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.270
 previously used but same 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.010
 mark what we're going to do and we're going to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.070
 choose the color of the accounts that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:03.700
 We also want to trace 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:07.550
 and this is recommended harder than 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.390
 as we pass we draw our hands and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.580
 obviously also this with care for 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 that the line is as close to your 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 hand not for then is to see also if 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.450
 you give one to someone each year 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.120
 you will also have your little hand 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.190
 different years not until it's the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.380
 same always then good while 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.430
 catalinas of that I'm up to the step 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.950
 final we have it cut here is 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 what we are going to do is this can 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.590
 be bigger obviously then here 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.060
 to the happy 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 the good color sheet 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.610
 if you make an accordion cited an accordion 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 quoted already you know with folds and here nothing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.530
 more the joke is to stick with your sticker 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.290
 back and obviously the other 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.049
 from this side 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.730
 so that you stay as much but for 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.209
 example lead birthday of some 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.030
 grandfather or the sister of the night to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.189
 that they want to make a letter 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.950
 and then do not know this can be something 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.379
 well super personalized but I would 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.720
 in you can go happy birthday you 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.849
 I love you and so on and then they 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.859
 you already feel that they made their little card and 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.840
 well they have the age not to throw something 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.659
 more be elaborated but with this is 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.609
 perfect and obviously you can use that 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:40.010
 for the wise men for your little letter 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.010
 santa on mothers day father's day 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.530
 and in mothers 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.130
 and also to their friends to their 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.120
 little friends is not father and you always have 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.860
 something a tip if they need like that to 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.720
 it is best to have it on display 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.610
 paste a magnet quoted here back and have them 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.980
 in respect and so they are doing their 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.800
 collection today at the end when she the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.660
 child and stop giving the criticisms can 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.750
 frame all of them and so have a 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.900
 growth sequence 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.410
 there is very cool this something more than 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.540
 want 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.130
