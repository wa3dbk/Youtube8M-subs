00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.340
Before Circuit of Ireland Rally we prepared a special surprise for Polish and Irish supporters and for my sister too.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
During this event I will wear a helmet with unique livery, designed especially for this event.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.460
It features Polish and Irish national colours, combined with symbols of these two nations: eagle and leprechaun â€“ little old man who, according to Irish folklore, inhabits the island.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.580
On the top there is a logo of our main Partner - LOTOS Group.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.280
And last but not least, there is a portrait of my sister on the backside of the helmet. She has been living in Ireland for couple of years, so it is important for me personally.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.540
My mum said: "It's you Kajto". No mum, it's not me, it is your daugther and my sister here on this helmet :)

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:50.240
Oncoming Circuit of Ireland Rally will be my first time, my first visit to this beautiful island. This is the reason why I decided to have these special paintings on my helmet.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.740
I can't tell you what the results of the rally will be, just like I can't predict the score of the match between Irish and Polish national football teams.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.260
Of course our job is to perform well in our debut in Northern Ireland, but we keep our fingers crossed for Polish footballers :)

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.100
Our team will play just a few days before we will compete on picturesque, but very demanding roads around Belfast.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.380
It's not gonna be easy, because it is our debut in this event, but whole LOTOS Rally Team is motivated and ready to fight :)
