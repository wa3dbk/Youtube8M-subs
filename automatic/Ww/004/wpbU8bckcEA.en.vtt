00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
games such as Crysis 3 for example you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.770 
games such as Crysis 3 for example you
need<00:04:10.710> for<00:04:11.100> real<00:04:11.790> course<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.390> order<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.690> make

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
need for real course in order to make

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.290 
need for real course in order to make
the<00:04:13.080> game<00:04:13.110> run<00:04:13.350> completely<00:04:14.340> smooth<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.850> by

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
the game run completely smooth and by

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.970 
the game run completely smooth and by
that<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:15.630> mean<00:04:16.049> physical<00:04:16.680> course

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980

Crysis<00:04:17.850> 3<00:04:17.900> pretty<00:04:18.900> much<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> less<00:04:20.100> than<00:04:20.370> 4

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
Crysis 3 pretty much is a less than 4

seven<00:04:31.050> eight<00:04:31.410> 50k<00:04:32.040> yes<00:04:32.669> apparently<00:04:33.000> it's<00:04:33.450> a

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
quad core yet it pretty much shows the

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.909 
quad core yet it pretty much shows the
same<00:04:35.910> performance<00:04:36.330> drop<00:04:36.780> as<00:04:36.990> we<00:04:37.470> see<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
same performance drop as we see on the

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.970 
same performance drop as we see on the
Intel<00:04:38.250> i3<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.000> Pentium<00:04:39.870> processors<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.620> guess

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
Intel i3 and Pentium processors I guess

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.860 
Intel i3 and Pentium processors I guess
you<00:04:41.100> now<00:04:41.220> get<00:04:41.430> my<00:04:41.610> point<00:04:41.880> but<00:04:42.390> yeah<00:04:42.630> overall

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
you now get my point but yeah overall

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.640 
you now get my point but yeah overall
this<00:04:43.380> pentium<00:04:43.919> g<00:04:44.480> 32:58<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.840> begging<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.470> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
this pentium g 32:58 is begging you to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.950 
this pentium g 32:58 is begging you to
overclock<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.400> i<00:04:47.730> can<00:04:47.910> clearly<00:04:48.240> say<00:04:48.660> it's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
overclock it and i can clearly say it's

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.470 
overclock it and i can clearly say it's
a<00:04:49.260> great<00:04:49.560> processor<00:04:50.250> once<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.760> overclocked

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
a great processor once it's overclocked

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.120 
a great processor once it's overclocked
you<00:04:51.750> could<00:04:51.930> also<00:04:52.110> go<00:04:52.380> higher<00:04:52.680> but<00:04:52.980> i've

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
you could also go higher but i've

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.210 
you could also go higher but i've
already<00:04:53.370> done<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.910> video<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.990> 4.7<00:04:55.800> gigahertz

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
already done a video on a 4.7 gigahertz

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.640 
already done a video on a 4.7 gigahertz
overclock<00:04:56.850> with<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.180> cpu<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> decided<00:04:58.500> to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
overclock with the cpu so I decided to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.740 
overclock with the cpu so I decided to
show<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.919> something<00:04:59.310> new<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:00.510> four

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
show you something new and that is four

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.780 
show you something new and that is four
point<00:05:00.990> two<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:01.500> four<00:05:01.919> point<00:05:02.190> five<00:05:02.400> gigahertz

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
point two and four point five gigahertz

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.330 
point two and four point five gigahertz
the<00:05:03.600> temperatures<00:05:04.110> are<00:05:04.350> no<00:05:04.620> problem<00:05:05.130> at<00:05:05.250> all

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the temperatures are no problem at all

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.430 
the temperatures are no problem at all
as<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.669> saw<00:05:05.850> in<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.030> charts<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.540> same<00:05:07.169> goes

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
as you saw in the charts and same goes

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.350 
as you saw in the charts and same goes
for<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.740> power<00:05:07.950> consumption<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.669> course<00:05:09.210> it

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
for the power consumption of course it

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.000 
for the power consumption of course it
increases<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> little<00:05:10.260> bit<00:05:10.410> but<00:05:10.740> it's<00:05:10.890> still

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
increases a little bit but it's still

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.610 
increases a little bit but it's still
completely<00:05:11.520> fine<00:05:11.940> yeah<00:05:12.690> all<00:05:12.960> good<00:05:13.260> now<00:05:13.470> in

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
completely fine yeah all good now in

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.830 
completely fine yeah all good now in
terms<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.980> performance<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:15.060> what<00:05:15.330> about<00:05:15.630> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
terms of performance but what about the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.870 
terms of performance but what about the
motherboard<00:05:16.350> for<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:16.980> review<00:05:17.430> i've<00:05:17.610> used

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
motherboard for this review i've used

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.510 
motherboard for this review i've used
the<00:05:18.030> intel<00:05:18.419> flagship<00:05:18.930> chipset<00:05:19.380> model<00:05:19.680> z97

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
the intel flagship chipset model z97

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.730 
the intel flagship chipset model z97
intel<00:05:21.240> says<00:05:21.450> it's<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.780> only<00:05:22.169> official

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
intel says it's the only official

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.980 
intel says it's the only official
overclocking<00:05:23.460> chipset<00:05:23.910> however<00:05:24.570> there<00:05:24.900> are

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
overclocking chipset however there are

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.110 
overclocking chipset however there are
certain<00:05:25.289> workarounds<00:05:26.190> from<00:05:26.669> motherboard

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
certain workarounds from motherboard

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.679 
certain workarounds from motherboard
manufacturers<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.350> you

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
manufacturers so you

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.719 
manufacturers so you
or<00:05:28.779> clock<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.349> cheaper<00:05:29.709> chips<00:05:29.949> at<00:05:30.159> models<00:05:30.549> as

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
or clock and cheaper chips at models as

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.759 
or clock and cheaper chips at models as
well<00:05:31.059> but<00:05:31.509> I<00:05:31.569> wouldn't<00:05:31.899> really<00:05:32.049> trust<00:05:32.559> these

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:32.769 
well but I wouldn't really trust these

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.609 
well but I wouldn't really trust these
in<00:05:33.069> the<00:05:33.489> end<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:34.059> could<00:05:34.330> have<00:05:34.599> just<00:05:35.080> wasted

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
in the end you could have just wasted

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:36.949 
in the end you could have just wasted
money<00:05:35.860> on<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.159> wrong<00:05:36.309> motherboard

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:36.959 
money on the wrong motherboard

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:38.819 
money on the wrong motherboard

overclocking ships at motherboards
however<00:05:39.249> aren't<00:05:40.089> as<00:05:40.209> expensive<00:05:41.019> as<00:05:41.169> they<00:05:41.409> used

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:41.709 
however aren't as expensive as they used

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.379 
however aren't as expensive as they used
to<00:05:41.860> be<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.009> couple<00:05:42.399> years<00:05:42.610> ago<00:05:42.849> so<00:05:43.360> you

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
to be a couple years ago so you

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.449 
to be a couple years ago so you
definitely<00:05:43.719> also<00:05:44.319> have<00:05:44.589> to<00:05:44.739> factor<00:05:45.009> in<00:05:45.219> the

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:45.459 
definitely also have to factor in the

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:47.519 
definitely also have to factor in the
additional<00:05:45.999> motherboard<00:05:46.449> cost<00:05:46.719> if<00:05:46.959> you<00:05:47.349> wish

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529 
additional motherboard cost if you wish

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.100 
additional motherboard cost if you wish
to<00:05:47.679> overclock<00:05:47.949> this<00:05:48.249> Pentium<00:05:48.699> G<00:05:48.879> 32:58<00:05:49.749> and

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
to overclock this Pentium G 32:58 and

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.499 
to overclock this Pentium G 32:58 and
yeah<00:05:50.769> this<00:05:51.039> pretty<00:05:51.399> much<00:05:51.639> wraps<00:05:51.939> this<00:05:52.089> review

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
yeah this pretty much wraps this review

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:52.979 
yeah this pretty much wraps this review
up

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:52.989 
up

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:54.869 
up
it's<00:05:53.319> definitely<00:05:53.979> recommend<00:05:54.399> to<00:05:54.549> overclock

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
it's definitely recommend to overclock

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.649 
it's definitely recommend to overclock
