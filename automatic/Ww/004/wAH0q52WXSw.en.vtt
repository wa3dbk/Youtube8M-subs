00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.830
 Yes, yes 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.709
 enemies of Athena we are as we are 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.709
 almost inside the engine's engine compartment 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.900
 it's another my adsl multijet 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.519
 - power levels I'm testing in 289 horses that it really is 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.759
 perfect for this silent car when we lose the engine compartment yet 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.939
 quieter very soundproofed inside practically no rap is heard 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.109
 really technical 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 daylight led headlights that frame 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.120
 villa lighthouse poly-ellipsoidal xenon mix - therefore also 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.200
 dazzling the xenon 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.350
 to activities 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 let's take a tour of the car 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 I'll show you the calender because 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.040
 the new lance and fiat 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.860
 tormentoni and then there is a radar for time is adaptive open collision ie 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220
 maintains a safe distance 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.680
 from the vehicle in front braking even six by chance to brake 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.989
 tires and wheels imposes on TV 20 inches 245 45 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.179
 as for my age and shoulder for a seal really 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.590
 exceptional I look at the mirrors because they are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 interesting 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.160
 chromed but above all intelligent 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.570
 we have 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.610
 interesting things this triangle that lights up when in the corner there 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.040
 grant a vehicle 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 this is a led 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 that we need to light up the whole side of night there 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.770
 allows you to view 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 the in the amg the app the blade in the door e 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.590
 r the indication that the mirror is re 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.909
 installed but not only is it also called comical so if someone has got us wet 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:39.600
 from behind 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 be darkened like all rear-view mirrors 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.130
 killers then age you can enter images in a grandmother's way to use le 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.520
 keys 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 door also here therefore complete with any type of button for all 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.979
 mirrors for central locking and mirrors 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.700
 create provisional we proposed Italian drafting of 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.820
 seat for texts - it's completely electric but I don't know if I even wear the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.460
 pedal board with this button 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.090
 we can move it further back based on our thesis people 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:18.049
 please civil and electric back support also support 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.779
 lumbar support we continue in light of the car because I have to do 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:23.330
 to see 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.829
 behind 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.789
 great comfort but above all seats 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.069
 heated 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.590
 that possibility to close the sunshade also 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.229
 behind the seats 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 rear 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:45.419
 behind the bars I'm a little less touched almost by the head of the pavilion 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.959
 trunk 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.489
 great but the most interesting thing is the button for opening and camera 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.840
 rear for parking really an angel hand on 5 meters 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.319
 of car 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.829
 we didn't have the escort kit to inflate the compressor too 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.779
 close 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.149
 the open trunk 1 makes others laugh at technological goodies 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.169
 ecological ticket for the senile who are both heated and 20 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.109
 sides 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.739
 there is a glass holder 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.319
 also heated oko cooled then it will keep 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.679
 soft drinks 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.439
 the desired temperature 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.119
 opening roof with two possibilities of opening 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:36.559
 only ventilation or complete opening the text is also equipped with a 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.299
 sunblind 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.459
 that can use you in the case of sun annoys us 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.319
 here is to see how the curtain is closing us 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.669
 electrically 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.059
 cv air conditioning 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.859
 very very complete 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.599
 it works well bin i was talking about similarity warm up the ones in front 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.299
 also 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.669
 refreshed what nice 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:04.349
 from the control post, the rear seat sunshade is operated 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.920
 that before 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.489
 he didn't show me 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.989
 I would say that for this he launches thema for the technique yourself.
