would<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.650> let's<00:00:29.160> give<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.610> bit<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
would be let's give it a little bit of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.380 
would be let's give it a little bit of
an<00:00:29.970> ambient<00:00:30.420> light<00:00:30.600> so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.080> see

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
an ambient light so you can see

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.260 
an ambient light so you can see
basically<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.840> we've<00:00:33.960> done<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.150> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
basically what we've done is this is the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.229 
basically what we've done is this is the
spawner<00:00:36.570> room<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.829> moved<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> wall<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
spawner room we moved the wall in a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.300 
spawner room we moved the wall in a
little<00:00:39.480> bit<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.500> there'd<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> even

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
little bit here so that there'd be even

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.220 
little bit here so that there'd be even
less<00:00:41.460> light<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.060> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.840> spawning

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
less light just to make the spawning

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 
less light just to make the spawning
rate<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.649> high<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:44.160> possible<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.809> put

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
rate as high as possible and then we put

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
rate as high as possible and then we put
a<00:00:46.020> bucket<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.440> water<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> corner<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
a bucket of water in that corner and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.680 
a bucket of water in that corner and
