 another video where I bring you a 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 very good news for anyone who likes molds 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 of Brazilian cars in gt as Sinhalese 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.710
 the national cars are coming 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.689
 finally there will be five and a lot of people today 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 think that modifications en mars 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.300
 polluting game 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.740
 I already think otherwise think leaves 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.510
 game much closer to the people in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 our reality is of course that there is a car 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.570
 for all tastes in your car 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 and many other modes as well. 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 coming from other vehicles and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 also in m is required to install nothing 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 you put what you want and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.850
 car that I really like that is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.040
 being developed for gt to five 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 euros until his video on gta 4 in his 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.440
 gt turbo version and of course guys who is the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 square goal if the first generation g1 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 this is the goo.gl made by 3d brothers 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.469
 who was a great author of modes of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.149
 Brazilian cars in other ways 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 also revolutionized the whole scenario 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.579
 digital in the country 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.469
 I did not do special to tell about 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 the ways that have revolutionized 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.730
 Unfortunately Bruno Simon died in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.589
 2012 I had a certain relationship with 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 he was one of the site's partners the site 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 it sm 3d 3d design bombing 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.439
 including several projects and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 cars that had done modeling 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.189
 perfectly that they were not aired 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 were available for download by 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.299
 account of the decease and also the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 Very nice face manja very expensive I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.840
 I remember that he revolutionized it with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 the molds of gta 4 because the modes of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.500
 Tuesday Andrés and love are well 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.240
 worked like this and when gta 4 was 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.979
 he was one of the first to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 bring national cars with 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.970
 detail for the game is the day detail 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 car but full time remembers that he 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.210
 made a sloop that was one of the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 the 1st so revolutionized 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.280
 4 gta templates now his car arrives 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.439
 remastered and adapted gta5 by tiago 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.549
 3d if you call my team who had what 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.750
 do when the time 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.549
 As you can see the car is still 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.619
 in beta it is not finalized 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.450
 in speaking being developed still has 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.159
 several bugs are missing several photos of it with 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.899
 for example the engine headlight parts 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.240
 but you can see how it is. 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.100
 getting 3d modes are coming to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840
 few only in a well plastered form 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 it's still pretty rough starting with the weather 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.369
 of lamborghini bugatti veyron do fusca 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 My fiancé is a national car. 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.640
 It was not done by Brazilians, right? 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.590
 only that these ways to this a good way 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.120
 everyone who does not even touch the wheel looks like a 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 cardboard death of bhutto 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.049
 well of the time it replaces a car 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
 normal game in that phone came with the 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.739
 new vehicles nothing has replaced the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.690
 own public that even looks like a goal and 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.700
 already a great evolution the wheels are 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.620
 move the car until it is damaged 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.180
 example the hood and the shock and the apple 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.940
 It's time he hit the car too. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.739
 catch fire has damage to bullets dimension well 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.299
 time compared to other modes're 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.739
 much more realistic and close to us 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.640
 will have in the future well-mannered 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.079
 worked 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.970
 I had a chat with thiago and I 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.920
 said that he is doing everything for himself 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.750
 software already known for modeling that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.489
 is the famous read mode that he wants to leave 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.709
 the mold is very similar to the cars that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.870
 we have a game on actively or well 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.700
 top textures in 4k ultra high 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.590
 resolution panel that works fully 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 the first person vision is flying 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.920
 that move with the movement of the arm 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.810
 of the characters the speedometer that also 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.090
 and various other details that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.190
 nor had gta4 then those modes in 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.780
 cars from gt to pc 5 have to come more 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.980
 imposing worked against the first 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.790
 person then you have to have much more 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.200
 detail 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 there are still several adjustments to be made 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.829
 done but unfortunately not fluent 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.659
 forecast for download and will give a lot 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.069

 I'm really looking forward to 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.269
 test this car in my game that will 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.099
 be very crazy and not only clear goal goes 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.290
 to reach but for sure other cars but 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.970
