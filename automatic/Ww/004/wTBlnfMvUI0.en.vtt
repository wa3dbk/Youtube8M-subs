00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 with a guide on skyrim with the guide up 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.650
 how to get the scream that allows us to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 partially turn into dragons on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.260
 new dlc dragonborn and let's start from 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 immediately in the main quest 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 you will explore the temple of sight that you know here 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 where it is and the first word is a lot 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.630
 very simple in short, right in the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.340
 first mission of the main quest 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.670
 you will find the first word and you will have to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 then fight against these things 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 coming to the end of the dungeon instead 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.960
 you will find this book here the black book 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.050
 that as soon as you read it you will see that there 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.960
 it will suck in it 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 transporting you to another dimension e 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.809
 you'll do anything a start 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.080
 filmed but this book will remain there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.840
 of the inventory and it will be very useful 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.810
 because if you see now to take the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.790
 second word of the shout you will have to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 read it again and when you read it again 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 alone 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 see what happens viri will carry from 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 new in that world only this time 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 not start any movie and you will be 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.220
 free to explore it and I sincerely 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.360
 I'm not going to guide you through 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.409
 the whole maze that this place 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.130
 because it is a tremendous thing 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.530
 complicated 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
 ie no complicated uncomplicated long 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 it is not complicated there is only at the end 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.060
 of books to be placed that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 you will collect while you are in here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.340
 that is, you will see now to move forward 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 here is a plan altar of this 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.329
 this world is full of books you see the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.040
 walls are books there are books by all 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.729
 the parts on the ground pages and flywheel and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.810
 swirl in the air and I don't know cocks e 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.439
 decks 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.790
 but in short to advance in this world 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.890
 you will have to practically get to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.679
 of the last laws as you see now 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.510
 down here precisely and these are the chapters 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.500
 you read the black book step by step 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.240
 step 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.900
 and meanwhile here we make a beautiful view 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.510
 of the psychedelic ocean of death that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.700
 he appears in front of us and falls only there 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.610
 inside guys because you'll die 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.680
 and in any case nothing happens if you die 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.959
 that you will return to the normal world in reality 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.570
 and this should be the fourth 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.010
 chapter instead of the world in short 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.890
 nothing that you will only have to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.570
 proceed from chapter to chapter and time 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 I say where is the tricky business 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.760
 in chapter 5 before you can access 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.550
 al 6 you while you are in this world 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.850
 you will collect various books of the various 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 chapters of the black book apart that yes 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.210
 they call for example one is a type thing 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.540
 piercing blades 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.820
 globes I don't know I don't remember so much 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 well, however, they are small books e 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.080
 practically then you will have to position up 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.340
 of laws and is easy to recognize 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.250
 because he has another it seems to me that if you love 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.050
 piercing pliers a stuff like that e 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.570
 they are easy to position because of it 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.430
 these laws have a design and you 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.350
 you will have to practically connect the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.040
 design at the title of the book is not 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.920
 difficult there is an eye of the jaws of the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.570
 tentacles and their claws tentacles 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.300
 if I'm not mistaken it's called limbs without bones 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.850
 luminescent globes senate globes something 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.220
 with help globes are pincer eyes 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:55.370
 they are the claws and open jaws they are 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.950
 like bitten teeth of something 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.780
 moving to the third scream and now how 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.940
 then see just after sawing 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.220
 some big monster, that is, the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.880
 second word, the third word, yes 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.470
 find it here at soul stein just arrived 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.630
 you will see it coming down from the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.230
 boat get them here the forge and from 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.239
 mold if you look to the right or 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.250
 you will notice a small path there and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.920
 that path will take you to a mine 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.530
 then in this mine you will be given 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.450
 a quest if you talk to the man and you will have to 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.700
 follow him practically in the dialogue 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:36.210
 during this west or a rare god 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.100
 this is the scalvi blog sword you will need 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.100
 to access the temple I will show you 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.890
 how this sword has a particularity 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.370
 releases energy rays when 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.460
 use a charged attack and the way of 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.740
 you can use it with this port 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.920
 the rip 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.340
 here is if you give a slash in the 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.740
 direction of the gap automatically 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.680
 activate the mechanism you see buffet 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.889
 with another it does not matter and centers it to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.400
 you in full though 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.120
 this is the way to go through 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.229
 this door very ingenious and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.379
 congratulations to bethesda for the look 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.689
 of the sword because it is fabulous 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.560
 she is one of the most beautiful two-handed swords 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.229
 that I've ever seen really beautiful e 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.360
 nothing you see me just open this 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.550
 little door that is not so much in but 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.469
 in conclusion 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.949
 and in fact here is the last gash 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.930
 just for horizontal the whole door e 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.430
 once you get to the bottom you don't 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.129
 I will show it but you will have to fight 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.099
 against a new priest of the dragon who 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.409
 will release a new dragon mask 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.080
 I do n't remember what it's called 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.180
 after that it probably includes rho 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.699
 at the end of the video or from some 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.560
 the third word starts in the middle 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.599
 here it is unlocked objective 20 c 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.300
 aspect of the dragon this is the scream that 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.729
 it partially turns you into a dragon 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.879
 how it will appear on your body 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.279
 an armor of dragon flakes and now 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.909
 you will see it in short then I'll explain to you 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:16.039
 well what the various stages do and what they do 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.069
 then the first stage will add 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.839
 just a pair of gloves and huge e 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.060
 it will be for physical power 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.580
 the second stage if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.710
 also adds armor to the chest and vi 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.979
 the third stage adds more armor 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.599
 you also see the helmet with horns 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.659
 very transparent this year is very much 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:38.719
 beautiful very much and the potential one at 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:41.599
 your screams then this scream is one thing 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.789
 over power to beast because not only 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:47.899
 will enhance armor and physical strength 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:50.469
 yell but if you go below 50 per 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:54.589
 one hundred health spa was next to you 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:57.500
 a dragon's blood an old blood of 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.120
 dead and risen dragon as spirit of the 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.009
 dragon 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.039
 you will see it spur me soon in fact 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.870
 I let it hit a little and here it is with 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.990
 you see his ax two seas there 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.750
 next to me and this guy you see uses 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.520
 the screams and use so many that is now cheering 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.169
 has frozen 1 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.680
 in short, nothing was the guide 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.289
 I greet you on the aspect of the dragon 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.810
 is 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:23.919
 you will most likely see other guides 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.970
 so that's all 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.970
 step and close bread
