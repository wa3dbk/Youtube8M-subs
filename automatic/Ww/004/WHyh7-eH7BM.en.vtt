flex<00:00:34.590> 2<00:00:34.920> does<00:00:35.280> feature<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> same<00:00:36.120> image

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
flex 2 does feature the same image

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.260 
flex 2 does feature the same image
processor<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> LG<00:00:37.860> g3<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> terms<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
processor as the LG g3 so in terms of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.410 
processor as the LG g3 so in terms of
image<00:00:39.420> quality<00:00:39.719> both<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> G<00:00:41.010> flex<00:00:41.190> 2<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
image quality both the G flex 2 and the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
image quality both the G flex 2 and the
LG<00:00:42.809> g3<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.250> similar<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
LG g3 are going to be very similar and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.180 
LG g3 are going to be very similar and
they're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> produce<00:00:45.270> similar<00:00:45.780> results

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
they're going to produce similar results

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
they're going to produce similar results
but<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> 4k<00:00:48.239> footage<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
but I really like the 4k footage that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
but I really like the 4k footage that
the<00:00:48.960> LG<00:00:49.469> G<00:00:49.649> flex<00:00:49.680> 2<00:00:50.039> captures<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the LG G flex 2 captures there's a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.819 
the LG G flex 2 captures there's a
pretty<00:00:51.210> good<00:00:51.300> dynamic<00:00:51.840> range<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.710> will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty good dynamic range and you will

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty good dynamic range and you will
definitely<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.489> able<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.850> capture<00:00:54.120> some

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
definitely be able to capture some

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
definitely be able to capture some
pretty<00:00:54.809> good-looking<00:00:55.350> videos<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
pretty good-looking videos with this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
pretty good-looking videos with this
sensor<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> did<00:00:57.480> notice<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.140> direct

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
sensor I did notice that in direct

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
sensor I did notice that in direct
sunlight<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.920> does<00:00:59.129> tend<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> over

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
sunlight it does tend to kind of over

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.740 
sunlight it does tend to kind of over
expose<00:01:00.719> certain<00:01:01.079> parts<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> images<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
expose certain parts of images but it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
expose certain parts of images but it
does<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> great<00:01:04.379> job<00:01:04.409> crushing<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> blacks

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
does do a great job crushing the blacks

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.780 
does do a great job crushing the blacks
and<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.450> making<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.990> appear<00:01:07.470> noisy<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.610> G

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and not making them appear noisy the G

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
and not making them appear noisy the G
flex<00:01:08.909> 2<00:01:09.119> also<00:01:09.630> does<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.200> laser<00:01:10.500> autofocus

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
flex 2 also does have a laser autofocus

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
flex 2 also does have a laser autofocus
camera<00:01:11.460> sensor<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> back<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> didn't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
camera sensor on the back but I didn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
camera sensor on the back but I didn't
really<00:01:13.409> find<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> too<00:01:14.220> useful<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.880> focusing

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
really find it too useful when focusing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
really find it too useful when focusing
on<00:01:15.540> subjects<00:01:16.110> during<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.070> mean<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
on subjects during a video I mean it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.370 
on subjects during a video I mean it
worked<00:01:17.939> half<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> time<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.110> great

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
worked half the time it was great

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
worked half the time it was great
focusing<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.009> distant<00:01:20.369> objects<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> mean

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
focusing on distant objects but I mean

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
focusing on distant objects but I mean
close-up<00:01:21.900> objects<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.680> had<00:01:23.070> some

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
close-up objects it just had some

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.789 
close-up objects it just had some
trouble<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.619> optical<00:01:25.619> image

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
trouble here and there optical image

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
trouble here and there optical image
stabilization<00:01:26.070> though<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.820> also<00:01:27.090> present

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
stabilization though is also present

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
stabilization though is also present
here<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.930> probably<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.350> favorite

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
here and it's probably my favorite

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
here and it's probably my favorite
feature<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.520> camera<00:01:29.880> sensor<00:01:30.270> since

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
feature about this camera sensor since

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
feature about this camera sensor since
it<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.840> does<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> great<00:01:31.740> job<00:01:31.770> as

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it really does do a great job as

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.630 
it really does do a great job as
studying<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> shot<00:01:34.009> because<00:01:35.009> without<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
studying the shot because without it the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
studying the shot because without it the
footage<00:01:35.970> you're<00:01:36.210> seeing<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.720> would<00:01:36.900> be

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
footage you're seeing here would be

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.039 
footage you're seeing here would be
terribly<00:01:37.650> shaky<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.970> yeah<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.750> let<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:39.960> know

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
terribly shaky but yeah so let me know

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
terribly shaky but yeah so let me know
what<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> guys<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.829> image<00:01:41.130> sensor
