able to go all night in any hammock
without<00:00:20.430> getting<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.150> walking<00:00:21.630> around<00:00:21.810> at

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
without getting up walking around at

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
without getting up walking around at
least<00:00:22.230> once<00:00:22.609> midnight<00:00:23.609> snack<00:00:24.000> maybe<00:00:24.300> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
least once midnight snack maybe that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.950 
least once midnight snack maybe that
would<00:00:24.750> help<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> continue<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
would help but I'm going to continue and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
would help but I'm going to continue and
I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:29.039> used<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> hammock

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
I think as I get used to it as a hammock

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
I think as I get used to it as a hammock
breaks<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.869> probably<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.369> able<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
breaks in I probably will be able to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.860 
breaks in I probably will be able to
sleep<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.120> night<00:00:35.210> although<00:00:36.210> even<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> bed

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
sleep all night although even in a bed

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
sometimes I can't sleep all night so it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.139 
sometimes I can't sleep all night so it
doesn't<00:00:39.090> look<00:00:39.149> good<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.660> anyway<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.850> far

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
