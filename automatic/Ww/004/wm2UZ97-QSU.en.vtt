00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.370 
an eye on it you should be able to see
it<00:00:18.830> cut<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.640> contour<00:00:20.270> cutting<00:00:20.689> path<00:00:20.900> once

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
it cut the contour cutting path once

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.029 
it cut the contour cutting path once
it's<00:00:21.650> finished<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:24.080> one<00:00:24.350> has<00:00:24.560> integrated

it's finished this one has integrated

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.950 
it's finished this one has integrated
meters<00:00:25.519> which<00:00:25.730> are<00:00:25.910> nice<00:00:26.090> tiful<00:00:26.720> you'll

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
meters which are nice tiful you'll

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.380 
meters which are nice tiful you'll
notice<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:27.470> will<00:00:27.590> advance<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:28.310> material<00:00:28.760> to

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
notice it will advance the material to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.700 
notice it will advance the material to
the<00:00:29.539> front<00:00:29.810> eater<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:30.230> let<00:00:30.410> it<00:00:30.500> set

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
the front eater to let it set

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.580 
the front eater to let it set
momentarily<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.609> dry<00:00:32.019> then<00:00:33.019> it<00:00:33.140> will<00:00:33.230> take<00:00:33.440> it

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
momentarily to dry then it will take it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.710 
momentarily to dry then it will take it
back<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:33.800> let<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.400> sit<00:00:34.670> there<00:00:34.699> for<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.269> you

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
back and let it sit there for you you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.500 
back and let it sit there for you you
can<00:00:35.900> see<00:00:36.019> it<00:00:36.140> advancing<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.269> it's<00:00:38.269> a<00:00:38.299> very

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
can see it advancing now it's a very

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.100 
can see it advancing now it's a very
nice<00:00:38.890> smaller<00:00:39.890> printer<00:00:40.670> usually<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:41.720> have<00:00:41.750> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
nice smaller printer usually we have the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.410 
nice smaller printer usually we have the
larger<00:00:42.500> 54<00:00:43.040> inch<00:00:43.250> ones<00:00:43.519> but<00:00:43.820> if<00:00:44.120> you've<00:00:44.269> ever

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
larger 54 inch ones but if you've ever

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.380 
larger 54 inch ones but if you've ever
seen<00:00:44.659> the<00:00:44.720> SB<00:00:45.170> 540<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.430> is<00:00:46.610> just<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.059> shorter

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
seen the SB 540 this is just the shorter

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.119 
seen the SB 540 this is just the shorter
version<00:00:47.750> one<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.140> benefits<00:00:48.530> i<00:00:48.769> would<00:00:48.949> say

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
version one of the benefits i would say

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.630 
version one of the benefits i would say
is<00:00:49.369> the<00:00:50.299> printer<00:00:50.570> itself<00:00:50.750> from<00:00:51.229> indian<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:52.580> a

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
is the printer itself from indian just a

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.079 
is the printer itself from indian just a
little<00:00:52.909> over<00:00:53.150> five<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.629> half<00:00:53.659> feet<00:00:53.809> long

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
little over five and a half feet long

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.119 
little over five and a half feet long
and<00:00:56.089> then<00:00:56.269> your<00:00:56.479> depth<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:57.140> about<00:00:57.530> 30<00:00:57.890> inches

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
and then your depth is about 30 inches

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.789 
and then your depth is about 30 inches
so<00:00:59.000> if<00:00:59.119> you<00:00:59.239> have<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.930> know<00:01:00.049> a<00:01:00.080> small<00:01:00.440> spot

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
so if you have a you know a small spot

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.340 
so if you have a you know a small spot
in<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.010> shop<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.879> runs<00:01:02.360> like<00:01:02.629> magnets

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
in your shop it runs like magnets

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.700 
in your shop it runs like magnets
stickers<00:01:04.449> smaller<00:01:05.449> benefit<00:01:06.049> there<00:01:06.260> goes<00:01:06.470> you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
stickers smaller benefit there goes you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:19.020 
stickers smaller benefit there goes you
can<00:01:06.860> watch<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.250> cutting<00:01:07.580> now

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
and you can see the middle print that we

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.750 
and you can see the middle print that we
ran<00:01:21.760> before<00:01:22.150> video<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.320> this<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.770> excuse<00:01:24.610> me

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
the quality of the print is a really

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.060 
the quality of the print is a really
good<00:01:27.130> not<00:01:28.000> hardly<00:01:28.330> any<00:01:28.600> incidence<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.560> banding

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
good not hardly any incidence of banding

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.149 
good not hardly any incidence of banding
in<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:30.490> for<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.360> four<00:01:31.659> color<00:01:31.930> machine<00:01:32.500> it's

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
in there for a four color machine it's

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.370 
in there for a four color machine it's
very<00:01:33.549> good<00:01:33.820> quality<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.570> machine<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.200> got

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
very good quality this machine we got

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.859 
very good quality this machine we got
used<00:01:35.680> with<00:01:35.950> very<00:01:36.159> low<00:01:36.340> hours<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.300> essentially

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
used with very low hours so essentially

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.620 
used with very low hours so essentially
all<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.159> revive<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.820> existing<00:01:40.360> heads

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
all we just revive the existing heads

for<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.350> surge<00:01:56.619> missed<00:01:57.009> overspray<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.240> have

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
for the surge missed overspray we have

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.180 
for the surge missed overspray we have
changed<00:01:58.780> those<00:01:58.960> out<00:01:59.940> we've<00:02:00.940> also<00:02:01.509> checked<00:02:02.470> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
changed those out we've also checked the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.510 
changed those out we've also checked the
the<00:02:03.580> dampers<00:02:04.080> we<00:02:05.080> checked<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.500> cap<00:02:05.710> tops<00:02:06.039> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the dampers we checked the cap tops the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.940 
the dampers we checked the cap tops the
dampers<00:02:07.000> cap<00:02:07.240> tops<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.720> heads<00:02:07.929> like<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.739> said

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
dampers cap tops and heads like we said

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.970 
dampers cap tops and heads like we said
since<00:02:09.280> they're<00:02:09.459> such<00:02:09.929> low<00:02:10.929> hours<00:02:11.350> on<00:02:11.530> those<00:02:11.739> we

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
since they're such low hours on those we

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.759 
since they're such low hours on those we
just<00:02:12.190> left<00:02:12.370> those<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.120> right<00:02:13.269> now<00:02:13.769> checked
