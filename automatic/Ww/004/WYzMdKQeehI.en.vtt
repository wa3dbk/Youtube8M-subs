00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
me probably he's been that long and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.130 
me probably he's been that long and
there<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:14.970> barely<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.479> people<00:01:15.750> come<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.049> this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
the summer when he was linked to unite

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.140 
the summer when he was linked to unite
in<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.410> summer<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:16.340> could<00:04:16.519> have<00:04:16.640> Stephen<00:04:16.970> got

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
in the summer you could have Stephen got

in the summer you could have Stephen got
rid<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:17.540> minus<00:04:17.810> e<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.109> it's<00:04:18.229> good<00:04:18.410> job<00:04:18.560> we

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
rid of that minus e so it's good job we

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.710 
rid of that minus e so it's good job we
didn't<00:04:18.890> saw<00:04:18.979> him<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.430> summer<00:04:19.700> but<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.150> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
didn't saw him in the summer but in a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.729 
didn't saw him in the summer but in a
way<00:04:20.870> he's<00:04:21.080> been<00:04:21.200> wasted<00:04:21.530> in

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
way he's been wasted in

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.610 
way he's been wasted in
bench<00:04:21.889> since<00:04:22.669> summer<00:04:22.970> as<00:04:23.150> well<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.960> think

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
bench since summer as well so I think

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.930 
bench since summer as well so I think
it's<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:24.949> good<00:04:25.039> move<00:04:25.099> overall<00:04:25.759> you<00:04:25.910> know
