stock that came with it was not

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.620 
stock that came with it was not
adjustable<00:00:33.820> there's<00:00:34.820> one<00:00:35.030> that<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.240> can<00:00:35.480> get

adjustable there's one that you can get
that<00:00:35.900> has<00:00:36.080> an<00:00:36.230> adjustable<00:00:36.530> lover<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.550> I

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
that has an adjustable lover but I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.880 
that has an adjustable lover but I
noticed<00:00:38.030> while<00:00:38.180> looking<00:00:38.510> at<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.560> it

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
noticed while looking at it that it

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.420 
noticed while looking at it that it
looked<00:00:40.100> like<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.490> was<00:00:40.580> it<00:00:41.060> was<00:00:41.240> adjustable<00:00:41.840> and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
looked like it was it was adjustable and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.250 
looked like it was it was adjustable and
all<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.820> Mossberg<00:00:44.330> has<00:00:44.480> done<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:45.050> that

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
all that Mossberg has done is that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.010 
all that Mossberg has done is that
they've<00:00:45.470> taken<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:46.150> ability<00:00:47.150> away<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
they've taken that ability away the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.479 
they've taken that ability away the
lever<00:00:48.290> away<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.730> make<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.300> adjustable

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
lever away that is to make it adjustable

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.540 
lever away that is to make it adjustable
and<00:00:52.489> all<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.760> have<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.060> do<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:54.250> get<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.370> pin

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
and all you have to do is get the pin

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.710 
and all you have to do is get the pin
out<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.600> make<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.930> functional<00:00:57.470> so<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:59.420> pin

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
out to make it functional so this pin

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.930 
out to make it functional so this pin
here<00:01:00.020> is<00:01:00.230> originally<00:01:00.860> recessed<00:01:01.310> all<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.820> way

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
here is originally recessed all the way

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.020 
here is originally recessed all the way
down<00:01:02.149> flush<00:01:02.899> with<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.230> hole<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:04.760> started

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
down flush with the hole and I started

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.700 
down flush with the hole and I started
looking<00:01:05.269> at<00:01:05.330> sec<00:01:05.570> huh<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:06.140> looks<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:06.530> there's

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
looking at sec huh it looks like there's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.170 
looking at sec huh it looks like there's
a<00:01:06.770> spring<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:07.280> something<00:01:07.490> down<00:01:07.640> there<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.000> what

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
a spring or something down there so what

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.969 
a spring or something down there so what
I<00:01:08.210> did<00:01:08.300> I<00:01:08.479> couldn't<00:01:08.630> get<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.110> out<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:09.530> tried

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
I did I couldn't get it out I tried

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.050 
I did I couldn't get it out I tried
drilling<00:01:10.190> through<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.520> top<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.000> a

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
drilling through the top but it's a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.910 
drilling through the top but it's a
hardened<00:01:11.390> think<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:12.320> hard<00:01:12.500> piece<00:01:12.890> of

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
hardened think it's a hard piece of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.719 
hardened think it's a hard piece of
steel<00:01:13.280> because<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:14.620> even<00:01:15.620> my<00:01:15.770> high<00:01:16.460> speed

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
steel because I my even my high speed

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.430 
steel because I my even my high speed
drill<00:01:17.000> bits<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.360> stuff<00:01:17.510> weren't<00:01:17.810> working

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
drill bits and stuff weren't working

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.990 
drill bits and stuff weren't working
over<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> while<00:01:18.740> on<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:19.430> thought<00:01:19.850> well

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
over a while on it so I thought well

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.780 
over a while on it so I thought well
I'll<00:01:20.299> try<00:01:20.510> this<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:20.930> plastic<00:01:21.790> polymer

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
I'll try this this plastic polymer

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.510 
I'll try this this plastic polymer
whatever<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.150> want<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.330> call<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:24.400> it's<00:01:25.400> not

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
whatever you want to call it it's not

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.610 
whatever you want to call it it's not
gonna<00:01:25.640> hurt<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.970> put<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> hole<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.590> I

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
gonna hurt to put a hole in it here so I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.280 
gonna hurt to put a hole in it here so I
drilled<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.340> hole<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.729> side<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
drilled a hole on the side of it and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.750 
drilled a hole on the side of it and
actually<00:01:30.950> where<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.100> drilled<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.490> out<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:31.729> may

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
actually where I drilled it out you may

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.680 
actually where I drilled it out you may
want<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.210> drill<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.140> little<00:01:33.560> bit<00:01:34.690> lower

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
want to drill it just a little bit lower

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.320 
want to drill it just a little bit lower
than<00:01:36.619> what<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.799> did<00:01:37.100> because<00:01:37.549> what<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.850> found<00:01:38.090> out

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
than what I did because what I found out

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.090 
than what I did because what I found out
we<00:01:38.540> drill<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:38.930> hole<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.380> side<00:01:39.590> right<00:01:39.799> there

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
we drill a hole in the side right there

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.640 
we drill a hole in the side right there
you<00:01:40.880> end<00:01:41.060> up<00:01:41.210> getting<00:01:41.360> access<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.320> spring

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
you end up getting access to the spring

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.490 
you end up getting access to the spring
that's<00:01:42.860> holding<00:01:43.189> this<00:01:43.280> pin<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:45.320> can

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
that's holding this pin in and you can

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.070 
that's holding this pin in and you can
simply<00:01:45.920> again<00:01:48.460> take<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:52.390> pic<00:01:53.390> or<00:01:53.630> something

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
simply again take a a a pic or something

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320 
simply again take a a a pic or something
of<00:01:54.200> some<00:01:54.439> sort<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.920> can<00:01:55.130> do<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.150> can

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
of some sort that you can do and you can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.390 
of some sort that you can do and you can
you<00:01:56.930> can<00:01:57.110> actually<00:01:57.259> get<00:01:57.650> down<00:01:57.680> in<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
you can actually get down in there and

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.350 
you can actually get down in there and
you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:59.210> pry<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.570> up<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:01.100> keep<00:02:01.729> prying<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.240> up

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
here's that there's a metal pin here

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.230 
here's that there's a metal pin here
with<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> spring<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.740> all<00:02:29.580> I'm<00:02:29.790> gonna<00:02:29.970> do

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
with a spring on it so all I'm gonna do

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.560 
with a spring on it so all I'm gonna do
is<00:02:31.370> I've<00:02:32.370> got<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.640> pulled<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.420> where

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
is I've got this pulled out to where

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.440 
is I've got this pulled out to where
it's<00:02:33.720> sitting<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> edge<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.070> the

it's sitting on the edge of the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.610 
it's sitting on the edge of the
adjustment<00:02:36.450> piece<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> pin<00:02:37.080> stays<00:02:37.380> up<00:02:38.450> so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
adjustment piece so the pin stays up so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.710 
adjustment piece so the pin stays up so
all<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.370> find<00:02:41.700> something<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
all I have to do is find something to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.210 
all I have to do is find something to
put<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.050> there<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.470> put<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.650> whole<00:02:43.860> string

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
put in there you can put a whole string

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.210 
put in there you can put a whole string
and<00:02:44.400> put<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> pull<00:02:44.790> ring<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.540> off<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> keychain

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
and put a pull ring like off a keychain

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.710 
and put a pull ring like off a keychain
I'm<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.760> make<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.910> little

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
I'm actually going to make a little

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.840 
I'm actually going to make a little
lover<00:02:48.959> piece<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> slip<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.519> there<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
lover piece and slip it in there and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.250 
lover piece and slip it in there and
make<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:52.230> original<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:54.260> but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
make it look as original as I can but

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
make it look as original as I can but
that's<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.070> only<00:02:56.280> difference<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.790> looks<00:02:56.970> like

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
that's the only difference it looks like

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660 
that's the only difference it looks like
from<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.050> ones<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.470> adjustable<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
from the ones that are adjustable and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.670 
from the ones that are adjustable and
the<00:03:00.150> ones<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.570> not<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.050> could<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.530> wrong

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the ones that are not I could be wrong

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.540 
the ones that are not I could be wrong
but<00:03:03.290> maybe<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.739> adjustable<00:03:05.400> one

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
but maybe this was the adjustable one

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.229 
but maybe this was the adjustable one
and<00:03:05.850> for<00:03:06.600> some<00:03:06.780> reason<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.110> didn't<00:03:07.320> have<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
and for some reason it didn't have the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.890 
and for some reason it didn't have the
lover<00:03:09.239> on<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:11.209> regardless<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.750> what

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
lover on it but regardless this is what

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930 
lover on it but regardless this is what
I<00:03:12.959> found<00:03:13.110> out<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.670> maybe

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
I found out for the one I have so maybe

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.280 
I found out for the one I have so maybe
check<00:03:15.209> yours<00:03:15.420> out<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.110> have

it's not adjustable and check and see if
you<00:03:20.910> see<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> little<00:03:21.299> pin<00:03:21.600> that's<00:03:21.870> sitting

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
you see a little pin that's sitting

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.180 
you see a little pin that's sitting
flush<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.100> there<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.700> odds<00:03:24.600> are<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.890> is

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
flush in there if it is odds are it is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.160 
flush in there if it is odds are it is
adjustable<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.209> need<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.540> get<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> pin

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
adjustable you just need to get that pin

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.539 
adjustable you just need to get that pin
out<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.829> can<00:03:28.980> hook<00:03:29.130> some<00:03:29.340> type<00:03:29.519> of

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.160 
out so that you can hook some type of
lover<00:03:30.540> mechanism<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.260> pulling<00:03:31.560> mechanism<00:03:31.730> up

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
lover mechanism or pulling mechanism up

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.199 
lover mechanism or pulling mechanism up
onto<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.860> can<00:03:35.070> pull<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.000> when<00:03:36.150> you

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
onto it so that you can pull it when you

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.240 
onto it so that you can pull it when you
need<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.780> adjust<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.230> stock<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.100> out

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
need to to adjust the stock in and out

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.050 
need to to adjust the stock in and out
so<00:03:39.120> um<00:03:40.250> hopefully<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.489> may<00:03:41.640> help<00:03:41.790> somebody
