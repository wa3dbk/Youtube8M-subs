00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
where I began riding with Leslie I felt

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.330 
where I began riding with Leslie I felt
that<00:01:16.119> dressage<00:01:17.080> wasn't<00:01:17.530> enjoyable<00:01:17.920> for<00:01:18.220> me

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
that dressage wasn't enjoyable for me

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.039 
that dressage wasn't enjoyable for me
because<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.700> was<00:01:18.850> constantly<00:01:19.299> fighting<00:01:19.930> with

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
because I was constantly fighting with

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.100 
because I was constantly fighting with
my<00:01:20.229> horse<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.920> was<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.310> his<00:01:21.820> mouth<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.720> knew<00:01:23.080> I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
my horse I was in his mouth and I knew I

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.810 
my horse I was in his mouth and I knew I
wasn't<00:01:23.409> riding<00:01:23.680> correctly<00:01:24.310> but<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.520> didn't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
wasn't riding correctly but I didn't

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.180 
wasn't riding correctly but I didn't
know<00:01:24.880> how<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.060> fix<00:01:25.330> it<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.920> since<00:01:26.920> I've<00:01:27.070> been

riding<00:01:27.340> with<00:01:27.490> Leslie<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.030> using<00:01:28.540> these<00:01:28.690> five

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
riding with Leslie and using these five

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.660 
riding with Leslie and using these five
steps<00:01:29.260> I've<00:01:29.680> just<00:01:29.890> become<00:01:30.220> better<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.580> better
