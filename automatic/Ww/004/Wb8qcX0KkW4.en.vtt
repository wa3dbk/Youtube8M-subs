00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.679 
as you're losing water anymore because
you've<00:01:45.610> reached<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.939> level<00:01:46.090> where<00:01:46.240> there<00:01:46.479> Keyes

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
you've reached a level where there Keyes

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.539 
you've reached a level where there Keyes
has<00:01:46.899> kicked<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.590> you're<00:01:48.070> actually<00:01:48.189> and

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
has kicked in and you're actually and

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.609 
has kicked in and you're actually and
basically<00:01:49.180> just<00:01:49.450> surviving<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> keto<00:01:50.229> diet

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
basically just surviving on a keto diet

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.560 
basically just surviving on a keto diet
and<00:01:50.920> you're<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.670> actually<00:01:51.969> losing<00:01:52.180> more

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
and you're not actually losing more

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.300 
and you're not actually losing more
water<00:01:52.780> at<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.140> point<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:53.979> certainly

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
water at that point so you certainly

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.730 
water at that point so you certainly
should<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.670> keeping<00:01:55.060> up<00:01:55.149> your<00:01:55.180> water<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.750> also

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
should be keeping up your water and also

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.380 
should be keeping up your water and also
a<00:01:56.979> potassium<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.609> magnesium<00:01:57.700> are<00:01:58.180> very

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
a potassium and magnesium are very

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.609 
a potassium and magnesium are very
important<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.899> course<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.140> keep<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.469> in

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
important of course that keep that in

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.130 
important of course that keep that in
mind<00:01:59.799> but<00:02:00.429> turning<00:02:00.729> with<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
mind but turning with that that is the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.080 
mind but turning with that that is the
case<00:02:02.289> it's<00:02:02.500> actually<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.950> reverse<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.939> a

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
case it's actually the reverse that a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.080 
case it's actually the reverse that a
high<00:02:04.390> carb<00:02:04.719> diet<00:02:05.100> keeps<00:02:06.100> retains<00:02:06.609> water<00:02:06.759> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
high carb diet keeps retains water in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.580 
high carb diet keeps retains water in
your<00:02:07.179> body<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.630> because<00:02:08.170> you're<00:02:08.289> going<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.560> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
your body and because you're going on a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.290 
your body and because you're going on a
low-carb<00:02:08.920> diet<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.280> said<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:10.000> body's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
low-carb diet I said your body's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.460 
low-carb diet I said your body's
flushing<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.840> out<00:02:10.929> because<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.230> no<00:02:11.320> longer

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
flushing it out because it no longer

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.870 
flushing it out because it no longer
needs<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:11.950> that's<00:02:12.250> your<00:02:12.340> initial<00:02:12.550> weight

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
needs it so that's your initial weight

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.970 
needs it so that's your initial weight
loss<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.660> after<00:02:14.050> initial<00:02:14.500> period<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.800> time

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
loss but after initial period of time

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.740 
loss but after initial period of time
once<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.220> become<00:02:15.460> keto<00:02:15.760> adapted<00:02:16.300> you're

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
once you become keto adapted you're

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.330 
once you become keto adapted you're
losing<00:02:17.020> weight<00:02:17.050> at<00:02:17.290> all<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.470> right<00:02:17.590> areas<00:02:17.740> and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
losing weight at all the right areas and

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.820 
losing weight at all the right areas and
again<00:02:18.580> we're<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> protein<00:02:19.560> Lodi<00:02:20.560> low

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
again we're not on a protein Lodi low

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.620 
again we're not on a protein Lodi low
protein<00:02:21.040> diet<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.090> you're<00:02:22.210> getting<00:02:22.450> adequate

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
protein diet so you're getting adequate

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.570 
protein diet so you're getting adequate
protein<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.650> fat<00:02:23.890> we're<00:02:24.100> losing<00:02:24.460> is

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
protein so and then fat we're losing is

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.009 
protein so and then fat we're losing is
is<00:02:24.820> actually<00:02:25.090> literally<00:02:25.450> coming<00:02:25.690> out<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.870> pet

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
is actually literally coming out of pet

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.339 
is actually literally coming out of pet
stores<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.620> not<00:02:27.340> from<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.030> muscle<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.200> of

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
stores and not from the muscle which of

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.059 
stores and not from the muscle which of
course<00:02:29.379> you<00:02:29.590> get

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
course you get

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.830 
course you get
we're<00:02:30.219> having<00:02:30.459> enough<00:02:30.640> protein<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.599> back

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
we're having enough protein so back

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.360 
we're having enough protein so back
again<00:02:32.109> very<00:02:32.140> healthy<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.099> is<00:02:33.159> a<00:02:33.219> pelham

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
again very healthy and this is a pelham

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.280 
again very healthy and this is a pelham
if<00:02:33.609> that's<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:33.969> there<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.180> people<00:02:34.569> seem<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
if that's out there that people seem to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.080 
if that's out there that people seem to
think<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> case<00:02:35.889> that's<00:02:36.040> very<00:02:36.370> very<00:02:36.849> closely

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
think is a case that's very very closely

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.550 
think is a case that's very very closely
related<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.659> the<00:02:37.810> myths<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.139> talked<00:02:38.379> about

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
related to the myths that I talked about

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.440 
related to the myths that I talked about
yesterday<00:02:38.769> actually<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.340> well<00:02:39.519> all<00:02:40.389> right
