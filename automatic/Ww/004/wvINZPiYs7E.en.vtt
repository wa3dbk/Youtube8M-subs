00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.470 
wise and also for the future and when I
looked<00:02:39.560> at<00:02:39.739> situations<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.940> look<00:02:41.239> promising

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
looked at situations and look promising

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.410 
looked at situations and look promising
future<00:02:42.050> then<00:02:42.290> as<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:43.160> turns<00:02:43.459> out<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.970> turns<00:02:44.269> out

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
future then as it turns out it turns out

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.670 
future then as it turns out it turns out
a<00:02:44.480> little<00:02:44.660> different<00:02:44.959> but<00:02:45.080> um<00:02:45.260> I've

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
a little different but um I've

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.440 
a little different but um I've
definitely<00:02:45.950> had<00:02:46.220> full<00:02:46.519> offers<00:02:47.209> four

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
definitely had full offers four

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.390 
definitely had full offers four
different<00:02:47.810> teams<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.769> not<00:02:48.920> about<00:02:49.069> that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
different teams so it's not about that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.540 
different teams so it's not about that
just<00:02:49.819> personal<00:02:50.540> choices

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.300 

I<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.320> got<00:02:58.470> some<00:02:58.620> great<00:02:58.650> teams<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
I think we got some great teams in the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
I think we got some great teams in the
league<00:02:59.460> but<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.790> feel<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> league

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
league but I feel like this is a league

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
league but I feel like this is a league
where<00:03:01.590> there's<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.490> too<00:03:02.670> much<00:03:02.880> difference

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
where there's not too much difference

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.290 
where there's not too much difference
between<00:03:03.720> each<00:03:04.320> team<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.100> feel<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.460> we're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
between each team and I feel like we're

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.740 
between each team and I feel like we're
one<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:06.930> two<00:03:07.140> moves<00:03:07.740> away<00:03:08.100> from<00:03:08.520> being<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.510> great

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
one or two moves away from being a great

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.300 
one or two moves away from being a great
team<00:03:10.050> we<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.440> have<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.710> put<00:03:10.950> some<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> the
