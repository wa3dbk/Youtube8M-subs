00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
we got the instruction manual thing for

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.890 
we got the instruction manual thing for
up<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:13.250> or<00:03:13.430> whatever<00:03:13.670> yeah<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.600> got<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.810> be

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
good care of this um I've heard that the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.770 
good care of this um I've heard that the
device<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.830> very<00:03:44.010> fragile<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:45.600> break

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
device is very fragile and it can break

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.800 
device is very fragile and it can break
easily<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:47.760> because<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.360> experience

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
easily just because of the experience

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.150 
easily just because of the experience
from<00:03:48.930> past<00:03:49.170> lets<00:03:49.590> players<00:03:49.800> who<00:03:50.010> actually

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
from past lets players who actually

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.670 
from past lets players who actually
receive<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.210> system<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:51.750> everything<00:03:51.810> but

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
receive the system and everything but

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.230 
receive the system and everything but
yeah<00:03:52.950> right<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.460> just<00:03:53.610> got<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> normal

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
yeah right here we just got the normal

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.850 
yeah right here we just got the normal
crap<00:03:54.630> or<00:03:54.840> whatever<00:03:55.080> from<00:03:56.270> intendo<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:57.960> you

whether or not maybe i should just get

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.470 
whether or not maybe i should just get
it<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.560> then<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.800> giveaway<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.400> game<00:04:11.610> to

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
it and then do a giveaway the game to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.790 
it and then do a giveaway the game to
what<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.810> guys<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:12.960> gave<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> code<00:04:13.620> or

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
what you guys just gave you the code or

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.650 
what you guys just gave you the code or
whatever<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.640> i'm<00:04:14.880> thinking<00:04:14.910> i<00:04:15.240> might<00:04:15.270> do<00:04:15.630> that

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
whatever so i'm thinking i might do that

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.370 
whatever so i'm thinking i might do that
it<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:15.990> depends<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.180> i<00:04:18.180> decide<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.170> do<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
it just depends on if i decide to do it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.780 
it just depends on if i decide to do it
or<00:04:19.500> not<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.830> yeah<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.370> sounds<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.730> sounds
