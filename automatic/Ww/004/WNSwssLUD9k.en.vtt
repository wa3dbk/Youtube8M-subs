about this coaching program yes it's a
sad<00:03:19.090> reality<00:03:19.120> no<00:03:19.690> no<00:03:20.079> pre-made<00:03:20.530> programs<00:03:21.040> are

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
sad reality no no pre-made programs are

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.610 
sad reality no no pre-made programs are
made<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.850> you're<00:03:22.840> obviously<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.230> custom

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
made for you you're obviously a custom

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.410 
made for you you're obviously a custom
person<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.190> you're<00:03:24.370> not<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.700> average<00:03:24.850> person

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
person so you're not the average person

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.120 
person so you're not the average person
nobody<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.810> right<00:03:26.109> it's<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.320> make-believe<00:03:26.530> idea

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
nobody is right it's a make-believe idea

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.390 
nobody is right it's a make-believe idea
so<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.760> premade<00:03:28.329> program<00:03:28.840> is

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
so a premade program is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.100 
so a premade program is
never<00:03:29.579> made<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.599> idea<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.959> we

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
never made for you so the idea that we

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.869 
never made for you so the idea that we
can<00:03:31.230> customize<00:03:31.739> based<00:03:32.129> on<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> results<00:03:32.849> that

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
can customize based on the results that

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.759 
can customize based on the results that
you<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.299> every<00:03:33.569> single<00:03:33.870> week<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.230> incredibly
