00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
four buttons this is a reader I made it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.600 
four buttons this is a reader I made it
myself

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
myself

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
myself
there<00:00:47.610> are<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> schematics<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> net

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there are a lot of schematics on the net

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.150 
there are a lot of schematics on the net
if<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.149> put<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.320> chip<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.520> reader<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.890> will

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
if I put the chip in the reader it will

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.900 
if I put the chip in the reader it will
show<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> lists<00:00:58.520> second<00:01:00.800> okay<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.699> can

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
show on the lists second okay you can

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.510 
show on the lists second okay you can
see<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.750> another<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:06.500> new<00:01:07.500> line

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
see that there is another a new line

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
see that there is another a new line
I<00:01:09.409> will<00:01:10.409> synchronize<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> clock<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:12.299> my<00:01:12.540> PC

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I will synchronize the clock with my PC

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.600 
I will synchronize the clock with my PC
so<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.220> clock<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> chip<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:16.189> it<00:01:17.189> current

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so the clock in the chip is it current

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
so the clock in the chip is it current
Stein<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:21.470> now<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.979> synchronized<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
Stein and now it's synchronized now I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.280 
Stein and now it's synchronized now I
will<00:01:24.659> use<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.930> same<00:01:25.650> chip<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:28.080> will

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
will use that same chip and I will

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.580 
will use that same chip and I will
synchronize<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:30.090> controls<00:01:33.110> when<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.200> put<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
synchronize the controls when I put the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
synchronize the controls when I put the
chip<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> control<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.270> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
chip at the control you can see it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.050 
chip at the control you can see it's
blinking<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> lot

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
blinking a lot

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
blinking a lot
it's<00:01:39.060> 1<00:01:40.430> let's<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:43.280> let's<00:01:44.280> free<00:01:45.200> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it's 1 let's do let's free and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's 1 let's do let's free and
it's<00:01:48.299> four<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.369> controls<00:01:50.880> which

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it's four so now we have controls which

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
it's four so now we have controls which
are<00:01:51.479> synchronized<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.659> LED<00:01:54.899> blinks<00:01:55.380> every<00:01:55.710> 16

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
are synchronized the LED blinks every 16

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.870 
are synchronized the LED blinks every 16
seconds<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.060> need<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.750> wait<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> lil<00:01:58.880> okay

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
seconds so we need to wait a lil okay

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.270 
seconds so we need to wait a lil okay
you<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.299> they're<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.890> completely

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you see they're not completely

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.020 
you see they're not completely
synchronized<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:04.250> inside<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.580> second

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
synchronized they are inside one second

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.589 
synchronized they are inside one second
limit<00:02:06.539> because<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:08.429> time<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.880> needs<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.420> read

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
limit because the time it needs to read

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.830 
limit because the time it needs to read
the<00:02:09.840> chip<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> put<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.190> its<00:02:11.430> memory<00:02:11.849> it's

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.360 
the chip and put it in its memory it's
not<00:02:13.370> completely<00:02:14.370> accurate<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.920> controls

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
not completely accurate the controls

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.630 
not completely accurate the controls
themselves<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:19.140> accurate<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:19.709> only<00:02:20.069> one

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
themselves are accurate for only one

years<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.620> I'm<00:03:14.400> good<00:03:14.760> enough<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> I'll<00:03:17.190> take

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
years so I'm good enough so I'll take

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.650 
years so I'm good enough so I'll take
the<00:03:17.700> chip<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.389> will<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the chip and I will put it in the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.910 
the chip and I will put it in the
receiving<00:03:21.660> part<00:03:23.299> when<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.510> contact<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.620> ground

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
receiving part when I contact the ground

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.699 
receiving part when I contact the ground
and<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.700> main<00:03:27.000> part<00:03:27.359> which<00:03:27.780> sends<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> data

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and the main part which sends the data

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.190 
and the main part which sends the data
the<00:03:29.370> LED<00:03:29.579> blinks<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:32.370> will<00:03:32.579> blink<00:03:32.790> till<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.780> move

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the LED blinks it will blink till I move

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.490 
the LED blinks it will blink till I move
it

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.420 
it
okay<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.829> know<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.100> moved<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.889> it<00:03:37.889> takes<00:03:38.220> around

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
okay I know I moved it it takes around

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
okay I know I moved it it takes around
50<00:03:39.420> milliseconds<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.819> write<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> chip

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
50 milliseconds to write it on the chip

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.920 
50 milliseconds to write it on the chip
in<00:03:42.870> reality<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.889> just<00:03:44.010> 2<00:03:44.910> or<00:03:45.000> 3<00:03:45.299> milliseconds

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
in reality it's just 2 or 3 milliseconds

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.590 
in reality it's just 2 or 3 milliseconds
but<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.530> sure<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:47.100> try<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> read<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.480> then

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
but to be sure I try to read it and then

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.020 
but to be sure I try to read it and then
again<00:03:49.049> right<00:03:49.370> till<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.180> safe<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.590> chip

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
again right till it is safe on the chip

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.539 
again right till it is safe on the chip
this<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.090> not<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.750> proper<00:03:55.109> received<00:03:56.069> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
this is not the proper received the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.240 
this is not the proper received the
proper<00:03:56.959> carriage<00:03:57.959> for<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> chip<00:03:58.890> there

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
proper carriage for for the chip there

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.670 
proper carriage for for the chip there
is<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.730> nice

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
is a nice

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.179 
is a nice
piece<00:04:01.829> of<00:04:01.860> plastic<00:04:03.049> but<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.500> costs<00:04:05.010> something

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
piece of plastic but it costs something

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.309 
piece of plastic but it costs something
like<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> few<00:04:05.939> dollars<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.540> for<00:04:06.780> testing<00:04:07.140> guy<00:04:07.290> I

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
like a few dollars and for testing guy I

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.550 
like a few dollars and for testing guy I
don't<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:08.150> don't<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.329> too<00:04:10.170> much<00:04:10.290> money

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
don't I don't have too much money

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.839 
don't I don't have too much money
because<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.280> whole<00:04:11.459> system<00:04:11.879> is<00:04:12.000> pretty<00:04:12.390> cheap

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
because the whole system is pretty cheap

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.120 
because the whole system is pretty cheap
if<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:14.970> put<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.510> second<00:04:15.989> in<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.859> third

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
if I put it in the second in the third

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.050 
if I put it in the second in the third
and<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.930> end<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.500> can<00:04:19.680> put<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.579> fourth

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and the end I can put it in the fourth

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.400 
and the end I can put it in the fourth
if<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:22.740> go<00:04:23.639> back<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.090> my<00:04:24.120> PC<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:27.020> put<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.139> chip

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
if I go back to my PC I put the chip

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.310 
if I go back to my PC I put the chip
there<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:29.190> new<00:04:29.880> chip<00:04:30.289> unfortunately<00:04:31.289> I

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
there is a new chip unfortunately I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.990 
there is a new chip unfortunately I
don't<00:04:31.380> have<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.770> hand<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.130> free<00:04:32.340> hands<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:32.970> I

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
don't have to hand the free hands so I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.980 
don't have to hand the free hands so I
will<00:04:33.449> give<00:04:34.050> ok<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.580> friends<00:04:35.970> here<00:04:36.240> you'll

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
will give ok I have friends here you'll

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.610 
will give ok I have friends here you'll
put<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.380> chip<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.860> reader<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:42.020> there<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.199> a

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
put the chip in the reader so there is a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.529 
put the chip in the reader so there is a
new<00:04:43.889> chip<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.930> in<00:04:45.930> its<00:04:46.110> memory<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:47.300> know<00:04:48.300> if

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
new chip and in its memory and know if

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.770 
new chip and in its memory and know if
you<00:04:48.750> will<00:04:48.930> see<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.289> there<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> lot<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:50.940> ffs

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
you will see it there is a lot of ffs

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.339 
you will see it there is a lot of ffs
that's<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.710> clear<00:04:53.550> part<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:54.810> you're<00:04:55.050> in

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
that's the clear part and then you're in

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:03.409 
that's the clear part and then you're in
the<00:04:55.380> rest<00:04:58.430> those<00:04:59.430> numbers<00:05:00.360> are<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.560> time<00:05:02.550> it

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
the rest those numbers are the time it

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.540 
the rest those numbers are the time it
starts<00:05:03.900> with<00:05:04.050> 4b<00:05:04.729> today<00:05:05.760> it's<00:05:06.410> well<00:05:07.430> 20<00:05:08.430> of

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
starts with 4b today it's well 20 of

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.510 
starts with 4b today it's well 20 of
20th<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.630> April<00:05:10.760> 2010<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.599> presume<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:13.889> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
20th of April 2010 so I presume it's the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.140 
20th of April 2010 so I presume it's the
correct<00:05:14.880> time<00:05:15.300> okay<00:05:18.530> if<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.310> chip<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.639> moved

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
correct time okay if I the chip is moved

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.240 
correct time okay if I the chip is moved
so<00:05:21.539> if<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.110> want<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.500> read<00:05:22.650> it

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
so if I want to read it

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.670 
so if I want to read it
I<00:05:23.300> made<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.330> software<00:05:25.229> which<00:05:25.500> works<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:27.680> some

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
I made a software which works with some

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.890 
I made a software which works with some
orienteering<00:05:29.310> software<00:05:29.849> something<00:05:30.570> from

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
orienteering software something from

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.279 
orienteering software something from
Marland<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.889> will<00:05:32.490> put<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.849> on<00:05:33.000> my<00:05:33.060> webpage<00:05:33.690> so

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
Marland I will put it on my webpage so

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.219 
Marland I will put it on my webpage so
you<00:05:34.320> can<00:05:34.710> see<00:05:34.949> it<00:05:35.070> over<00:05:35.250> there<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:37.050> whole

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
you can see it over there the whole

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
bucks I made these for 5 bucks

it's<00:06:34.389> made<00:06:34.690> of<00:06:34.900> a<00:06:35.680> connector<00:06:36.310> for<00:06:36.340> a<00:06:36.550> garden

it's made of a connector for a garden
hose<00:06:39.360> one<00:06:40.360> screw<00:06:40.750> and<00:06:41.050> some<00:06:41.979> rubber<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:43.870> it's

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
hose one screw and some rubber so it's

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.870 
hose one screw and some rubber so it's
pretty<00:06:44.530> cheap<00:06:44.800> and<00:06:45.039> pretty<00:06:45.280> standard<00:06:45.699> the

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
pretty cheap and pretty standard the

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.040 
pretty cheap and pretty standard the
whole<00:06:46.509> the<00:06:47.050> whole<00:06:47.729> control<00:06:48.750> costs<00:06:49.750> less<00:06:50.020> than

whole the whole control costs less than
ten<00:06:50.710> US<00:06:51.220> dollars<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:53.010> I<00:06:54.010> think<00:06:54.310> that's<00:06:54.490> it<00:06:54.639> for

ten US dollars and I think that's it for
everything<00:06:55.960> else<00:06:56.139> there<00:06:56.680> will<00:06:56.830> be<00:06:56.860> pictures
