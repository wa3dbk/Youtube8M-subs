00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that does your point a point know when

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700 
that does your point a point know when
they're<00:00:20.550> already<00:00:20.820> coded<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> Tom<00:00:22.050> responds

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
they're already coded and Tom responds

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
they're already coded and Tom responds
simply<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:23.490> half<00:00:23.790> the<00:00:23.820> code<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.450> actually

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
simply because half the code is actually

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.800 
simply because half the code is actually
missing<00:00:25.430> there's<00:00:26.430> no<00:00:26.730> multiplayer<00:00:27.150> features

biomes I don't know if this is going to

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.259 
biomes I don't know if this is going to
be<00:00:42.179> like<00:00:42.739> entirely<00:00:43.739> brand<00:00:44.070> new<00:00:44.339> biomes<00:00:44.909> like

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
all the ones in zero point on in the 1.7

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.899 
all the ones in zero point on in the 1.7
PC<00:00:48.569> update<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.339> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.440> more

PC update or if it's going to be a more

PC update or if it's going to be a more
organized<00:00:53.909> form<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.949> laying<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.219> biomes<00:00:56.699> in

organized form of laying out biomes in

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.049 
organized form of laying out biomes in
the<00:00:57.089> game<00:00:57.269> by<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.319> way<00:00:58.589> new<00:00:58.889> biomes<00:00:59.339> are<00:00:59.729> being

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the game by the way new biomes are being

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.139 
the game by the way new biomes are being
added<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.350> can't<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> 0.8<00:01:02.639> win<00:01:02.850> 0

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
added and this can't be in 0.8 win 0

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
added and this can't be in 0.8 win 0
because<00:01:03.569> half<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> code<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> missing<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because half the code is missing so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
because half the code is missing so
that's<00:01:06.329> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.630> unfortunate<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that's a little unfortunate we will have

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
that's a little unfortunate we will have
to<00:01:07.860> wait<00:01:08.009> till<00:01:08.189> next<00:01:08.219> update<00:01:09.140> next<00:01:10.140> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to wait till next update next up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
to wait till next update next up
somebody<00:01:10.710> asks<00:01:11.159> again<00:01:11.340> why<00:01:11.909> caves<00:01:12.360> were

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
somebody asks again why caves were

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.690 
somebody asks again why caves were
delayed<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.040> that's<00:01:14.369> better

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
delayed and they think that's better

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
delayed and they think that's better
doing<00:01:15.119> caves<00:01:15.600> instead<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> other

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
doing caves instead of all the other

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
doing caves instead of all the other
random<00:01:17.189> crap<00:01:17.670> they're<00:01:17.939> throwing<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> 20<00:01:18.960> point

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
random crap they're throwing in 20 point

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.819 
random crap they're throwing in 20 point
8.0<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> tom<00:01:20.880> says<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
8.0 and tom says well it's because it

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.980 
8.0 and tom says well it's because it
needs<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.250> entirely<00:01:23.670> new<00:01:23.850> form<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.659> world

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
needs an entirely new form of world

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
needs an entirely new form of world
generating<00:01:25.530> also<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.490> terrain<00:01:26.700> code<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
generating also the new terrain code is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
generating also the new terrain code is
needed<00:01:27.810> especially<00:01:28.049> since<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.859> will<00:01:28.950> actually

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
needed especially since it will actually

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.690 
needed especially since it will actually
break<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:31.049> old<00:01:31.439> worlds<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.549> were

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
break all of the old worlds that were

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
break all of the old worlds that were
generated<00:01:32.880> prior<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.990> 0.9<00:01:34.649> point<00:01:35.039> 0<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.229> they

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
generated prior to 0.9 point 0 and they

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.560 
generated prior to 0.9 point 0 and they
figured<00:01:37.590> they<00:01:37.740> should<00:01:37.950> include<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> these

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
figured they should include all of these

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.959 
figured they should include all of these
new<00:01:39.780> features<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.619> single<00:01:40.920> update<00:01:41.399> which

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
new features in one single update which

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.690 
new features in one single update which
is<00:01:42.119> why<00:01:42.299> 0.9<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.200> 0<00:01:43.469> will<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.429> caves

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is why 0.9 point 0 will be for caves

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.039 
is why 0.9 point 0 will be for caves
