 beautiful site more time at the time I was sad and moody 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.519
 why they did not win 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.519
 like the calls 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 500 that would have been the only blue that was reached 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.199
 we give them to young people 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.740
 this is what m 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.740
 useless as 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.650
 well no 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.510
 power is expensive 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 what about 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 a medal record for canada 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 click on the subject for a total actually for almost a month 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.020
 this second round 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.570
 following m 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 and then only out of the room 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 I'm excited 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.819
 why what is holding back is not to have 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.190
 to spray why composting even this does not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 the judge 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 and when they have the rating 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.830
 furthermore 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.249

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.700
 while the cac 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.369
 to know it a nice gesture to the word happy whether it's the balloon 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 apple 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 m it sucks anne ap suite actually 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.609
 ali not the rule and that's what the dough 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.980
 that's why africa does not have the ad that the little family 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.289
 after leaving the palace was 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.329

 on his side hailed the title role 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.609
 the departure why 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.709

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.019
