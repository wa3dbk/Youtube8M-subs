use it for my face because its face

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.920 
use it for my face because its face
gentle<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.760> SPF<00:00:53.969> 15<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.809> really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gentle and it has SPF 15 so it's really

gentle and it has SPF 15 so it's really
stuck<00:00:55.170> outside<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.680> great<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
stuck outside this is great for that so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880
