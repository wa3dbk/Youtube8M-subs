hey guys this is no one wallet and this
is<00:00:58.900> my<00:00:59.370> take<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.580> an<00:01:00.730> antechamber<00:01:01.120> it's<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.990> game

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
is my take on an antechamber it's a game

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260 
is my take on an antechamber it's a game
where<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.770> kind<00:01:02.950> of<00:01:03.160> messes<00:01:03.640> about<00:01:04.030> with<00:01:04.150> your

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
where it kind of messes about with your

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.540 
where it kind of messes about with your
mind<00:01:04.510> like<00:01:05.020> it<00:01:05.260> keeps<00:01:05.620> changing<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.340> room

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
mind like it keeps changing the room

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.060 
mind like it keeps changing the room
every<00:01:07.090> time<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.360> look<00:01:07.450> away<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.620> really

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
every time you look away and it's really

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.460 
every time you look away and it's really
weird<00:01:09.520> game<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.390> its<00:01:10.960> own<00:01:11.050> leave<00:01:11.200> everyone

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
weird game I its own leave everyone

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.390 
weird game I its own leave everyone
steam<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.700> not<00:01:12.850> for<00:01:13.210> consoles<00:01:13.750> but<00:01:14.400> yeah

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
steam it's not for consoles but yeah

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.220 
steam it's not for consoles but yeah
it's<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.940> pretty<00:01:16.090> cool<00:01:16.300> game<00:01:16.510> so<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.140> my

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
it's a pretty cool game so this is my

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's a pretty cool game so this is my
take<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.620> it<00:01:17.680> after<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.400> broken<00:01:18.670> into<00:01:19.000> two

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
take on it after it's broken into two

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
take on it after it's broken into two
parts<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:21.280> got<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:22.210> first<00:01:22.540> bit<00:01:22.840> where<00:01:23.170> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
parts I've got the first bit where you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.100 
parts I've got the first bit where you
keep<00:01:24.460> walking<00:01:24.670> around<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.450> seems<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.960> it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
keep walking around it seems like it's

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.840 
keep walking around it seems like it's
turning<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.860> turning<00:01:27.040> turning<00:01:27.460> it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
turning and turning turning it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.210 
turning and turning turning it's
impossible<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.570> would<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.619> edited<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.100> out

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
impossible I would have edited it out

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.010 
impossible I would have edited it out
hopefully<00:01:30.490> with<00:01:31.030> video<00:01:31.780> editing<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.590> flashes

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hopefully with video editing the flashes

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.330 
hopefully with video editing the flashes
but<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.440> basically<00:01:35.710> controlled<00:01:36.160> by<00:01:36.280> these

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
but it's basically controlled by these

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.810 
but it's basically controlled by these
command<00:01:36.820> blocks<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.300> if<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.780> come<00:01:38.080> over<00:01:38.140> here

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
command blocks here if I come over here

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.460 
command blocks here if I come over here
so<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.450> flashing<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.229> it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
so you see this is flashing and it's

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.550 
so you see this is flashing and it's
just<00:01:42.060> activating<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.180> command<00:01:43.420> blocks<00:01:43.630> so

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
just activating the command blocks so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.440 
just activating the command blocks so
I've<00:01:44.979> got<00:01:45.130> three<00:01:45.520> because<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.060> keep<00:01:46.150> sending

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
I've got three because you keep sending

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.560 
I've got three because you keep sending
in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.950> left<00:01:48.220> middle<00:01:48.490> or<00:01:48.700> center<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.360> each

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
in the left middle or center of each

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.219 
in the left middle or center of each
chamber<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.280> I've<00:01:51.640> got<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:52.119> marked<00:01:52.840> above<00:01:53.080> with

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
chamber so I've got a marked above with

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.790 
chamber so I've got a marked above with
sandstone<00:01:53.740> where<00:01:54.100> all<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.640> things<00:01:54.850> are<00:01:55.090> and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
sandstone where all the things are and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.570 
sandstone where all the things are and
then<00:01:57.660> finally<00:01:58.660> when<00:01:59.289> it<00:01:59.530> connects<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.250> goes

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
then finally when it connects it goes

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.230 
then finally when it connects it goes
from<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.149> this<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:02.490> snow<00:02:03.490> bit<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:03.910> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
from this one this and snow bit here and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.139 
from this one this and snow bit here and
it's<00:02:04.509> helped<00:02:04.720> whatchu<00:02:05.050> up<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:06.520> here<00:02:06.940> I

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
it's helped whatchu up about here I

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.000 
it's helped whatchu up about here I
should<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:07.869> some<00:02:08.050> Sun<00:02:08.380> stone<00:02:08.649> marker<00:02:09.070> here

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
should have some Sun stone marker here

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.660 
should have some Sun stone marker here
it's<00:02:12.010> about<00:02:12.100> there<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:14.190> basically<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.580> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
it's about there and basically it's a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.210 
it's about there and basically it's a
butcher<00:02:15.970> here<00:02:16.240> then<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.290> pick<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> path<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
butcher here then you pick a path and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.430 
butcher here then you pick a path and
both<00:02:19.060> paths<00:02:19.920> marked<00:02:20.920> about<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.850> if<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:23.200> up

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
both paths marked about here if you up

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.059 
both paths marked about here if you up
or<00:02:24.040> down<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.850> think<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.360> here<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> take

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
or down I think it's here then I take

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.640 
or down I think it's here then I take
backs<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.750> if<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.960> turn<00:02:29.140> around<00:02:29.290> you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
backs here but if you turn around you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.030 
backs here but if you turn around you
can<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.580> green<00:02:31.000> section<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.800> is

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
can go to the green section and this is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.780 
can go to the green section and this is
based<00:02:33.250> off<00:02:33.900> part<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.080> game<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.640> bit

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
based off part of the game and is a bit

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550 
based off part of the game and is a bit
spaced<00:02:37.090> apart<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> game<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:37.990> not

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
spaced apart of the game I'm not

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.470 
spaced apart of the game I'm not
actually<00:02:38.740> sure<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.160> they're<00:02:39.760> from<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.240> same

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
actually sure if they're from the same

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.010 
actually sure if they're from the same
part<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:41.740> they<00:02:42.370> were<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.640> order<00:02:43.020> they're

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
part if they were in order they're

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.960 
part if they were in order they're
fairly<00:02:44.319> close<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:45.250> start<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> game

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
fairly close like this start the game

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.750 
fairly close like this start the game
but<00:02:46.360> not<00:02:47.050> sure<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.290> they're<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.530> order<00:02:47.860> as<00:02:48.100> such

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
but not sure if they're in order as such

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.320 
but not sure if they're in order as such
ah<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.560> yeah<00:02:50.950> that's<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:51.940> i<00:02:52.120> thought

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
ah but yeah that's about it i thought

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.860 
ah but yeah that's about it i thought
i'd<00:02:52.480> show<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.020> it's<00:02:53.530> pretty<00:02:53.800> cool<00:02:54.870> it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
i'd show you it it's pretty cool it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.990 
i'd show you it it's pretty cool it
should<00:02:56.140> show<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> command<00:02:56.740> blocks<00:02:57.000> so

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
should show you the command blocks so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.970 
should show you the command blocks so
here<00:02:58.330> are<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.420> creme<00:02:58.569> blocks<00:02:58.920> flashing<00:02:59.920> on

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
here are the creme blocks flashing on

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.490 
here are the creme blocks flashing on
off<00:03:00.160> I'm<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.490> going<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.700> turn<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.060> off<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.900> use

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
off I'm just going to turn it off I use

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.970 
off I'm just going to turn it off I use
the<00:03:02.790> comparator<00:03:03.790> clock<00:03:04.030> here

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
the comparator clock here

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.850 
the comparator clock here
this<00:03:06.300> very<00:03:07.300> compact<00:03:07.659> clock<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.200> turn<00:03:08.530> on/off

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
this very compact clock and turn on/off

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.100 
this very compact clock and turn on/off
like<00:03:09.099> this<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.680> glistened<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.989> is

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
like this that glistened here so this is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.530 
like this that glistened here so this is
just<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:15.190> seeing<00:03:15.400> from<00:03:15.580> if<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.909> hear<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.360> go

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
just just seeing from if you hear it go

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.460 
just just seeing from if you hear it go
here<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.110> that's<00:03:17.890> basically<00:03:18.099> wait<00:03:18.370> does<00:03:19.470> also

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
here and that's basically wait does also

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
here and that's basically wait does also
not<00:03:20.739> very<00:03:20.769> much<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.280> me<00:03:21.370> showing<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:22.030> of

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
not very much for me showing you all of

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.800 
not very much for me showing you all of
them<00:03:22.269> get<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.319> idea<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:25.090> as<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.299> can<00:03:25.390> see<00:03:25.629> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
them get the idea but as you can see the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.900 
them get the idea but as you can see the
foot<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.260> x-coordinate<00:03:26.830> changes<00:03:27.220> by<00:03:27.340> 1<00:03:27.370> on

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
foot the x-coordinate changes by 1 on

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.470 
foot the x-coordinate changes by 1 on
both<00:03:28.090> sides<00:03:28.390> for<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.110> channel<00:03:29.940> see<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.090> i'll

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
both sides for the channel see I so i'll

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.390 
both sides for the channel see I so i'll
show<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.470> play<00:03:32.920> clock<00:03:33.129> you<00:03:33.280> know

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
show you that and play clock you know

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.299 
show you that and play clock you know
see<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.730> again<00:03:33.910> next<00:03:34.060> time
