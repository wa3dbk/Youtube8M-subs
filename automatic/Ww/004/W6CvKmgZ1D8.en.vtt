00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
wave is just go ahead and kind of wiggle

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.580 
wave is just go ahead and kind of wiggle

your hand a karate chop hand right
inside<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.550> curls<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.570> you'll<00:04:52.810> start<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.289> see

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
inside the curls and you'll start to see

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.430 
inside the curls and you'll start to see
the<00:04:53.979> dips<00:04:54.430> developing<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.870> there<00:04:56.050> we<00:04:56.139> go<00:04:56.259> we

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
the dips developing so there we go we

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.159 
the dips developing so there we go we
have<00:04:56.620> another<00:04:56.860> one<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.720> then<00:04:58.720> now<00:04:58.930> I'm<00:04:59.050> going

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
have another one and then now I'm going

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.830 
have another one and then now I'm going
to<00:04:59.229> hold<00:04:59.380> on<00:04:59.710> to<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:00.759> clip<00:05:02.190> then<00:05:03.190> brush<00:05:03.909> and

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
to hold on to that clip then brush and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.960 
to hold on to that clip then brush and
then<00:05:05.110> for<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.470> rest<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.159> hair<00:05:06.370> here<00:05:06.789> I'm

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
then for the rest of the hair here I'm

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.999 
then for the rest of the hair here I'm
just<00:05:07.630> going<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:09.780> brush<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.810> into<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.349> uniform

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
just going to brush it into a uniform

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.850 
just going to brush it into a uniform
curl<00:05:12.699> and<00:05:13.000> then<00:05:13.449> take<00:05:13.690> my<00:05:13.870> finger<00:05:14.229> and<00:05:14.259> wrap<00:05:14.650> it

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
curl and then take my finger and wrap it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.300 
curl and then take my finger and wrap it
around<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.400> we<00:05:15.639> have<00:05:15.729> a<00:05:15.759> nice<00:05:16.060> like<00:05:16.449> end<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:18.190> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
around so we have a nice like end to the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.760 
around so we have a nice like end to the
curl<00:05:18.550> there<00:05:19.259> and<00:05:20.259> you're<00:05:20.380> going<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:20.530> do<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
curl there and you're going to do the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.490 
curl there and you're going to do the
same<00:05:20.949> thing<00:05:21.190> on<00:05:21.370> this<00:05:21.669> side<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:23.050> what's<00:05:23.259> nice

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
same thing on this side and what's nice

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.010 
same thing on this side and what's nice
about<00:05:23.560> this<00:05:24.130> is<00:05:24.400> when<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.120> pull<00:05:25.750> down<00:05:25.780> the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
about this is when you pull down the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.839 
about this is when you pull down the
hair<00:05:26.380> like<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:26.889> so<00:05:27.159> it<00:05:27.250> looks<00:05:27.280> like<00:05:27.550> it's

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
hair like this so it looks like it's

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.790 
hair like this so it looks like it's
straight<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.419> then<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.960> start<00:05:29.259> to<00:05:29.470> release

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
straight and then you start to release

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.890 
straight and then you start to release
you're<00:05:30.400> gonna<00:05:30.669> start<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.180> see<00:05:31.360> some<00:05:31.659> of<00:05:31.810> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
you're gonna start to see some of the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.379 
you're gonna start to see some of the
waves<00:05:32.169> already<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:33.610> that's<00:05:33.789> a<00:05:33.909> good<00:05:34.060> way<00:05:34.210> as

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
waves already so that's a good way as

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.719 
waves already so that's a good way as
well<00:05:34.659> as<00:05:34.960> kind<00:05:35.409> of<00:05:35.530> telling<00:05:36.009> where<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.520> waves

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
well as kind of telling where the waves

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.529 
well as kind of telling where the waves
will<00:05:37.150> be<00:05:37.500> or<00:05:38.500> where<00:05:38.800> they're<00:05:38.949> following

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
will be or where they're following
