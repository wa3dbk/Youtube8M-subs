00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

a<00:00:00.060> couple<00:00:00.630> days<00:00:00.810> later<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.469> socket<00:00:01.829> was<00:00:01.979> back

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
a couple days later the socket was back

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.630 
a couple days later the socket was back
and<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:03.149> arms<00:00:03.480> reached<00:00:04.100> less<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> team

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and the arms reached less and the team

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.320 
and the arms reached less and the team
were<00:00:05.940> about<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.450> make<00:00:06.629> history<00:00:08.120> once<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
were about to make history once the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.419 
were about to make history once the
training<00:00:09.690> sessions<00:00:10.139> were<00:00:10.530> complete<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.219> they

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
training sessions were complete and they

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.160 
training sessions were complete and they
released<00:00:11.820> me<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> let<00:00:12.300> me<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.690> computer

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
released me and let me be the computer

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.970 
released me and let me be the computer
basically<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.759> control<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.240> arm<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.859> just<00:00:16.859> go

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
basically to control that arm I just go

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.460 
basically to control that arm I just go
into<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> whole<00:00:17.310> different<00:00:17.430> world<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.470> think

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
into a whole different world I think

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.050 
into a whole different world I think
we're<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.710> getting<00:00:19.949> started<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.730> point

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
we're just getting started at this point

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.910 
we're just getting started at this point
it's<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> early<00:00:22.080> days<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> Internet

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's like the early days of the Internet

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.470 
it's like the early days of the Internet
there's<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.609> tremendous<00:00:23.789> amount<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
there's just a tremendous amount of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.929 
there's just a tremendous amount of
potential<00:00:24.990> ahead<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> us<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.640> just

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
potential ahead of us and we just

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.509 
potential ahead of us and we just
started<00:00:27.810> down<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.199> road<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.130> next

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
started down this road I think the next

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
started down this road I think the next
five<00:00:30.359> ten<00:00:30.810> years<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.410> bring<00:00:31.769> some

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
five ten years are gonna bring some

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.700 
five ten years are gonna bring some
really<00:00:32.520> phenomenal<00:00:32.899> advancements<00:00:33.899> other

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
really phenomenal advancements other

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
really phenomenal advancements other

was<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.559> time<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> mpls<00:00:38.760> were

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
was the first time the mpls were

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.240 
was the first time the mpls were
operated<00:00:39.390> by<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> shorter<00:00:40.140> level<00:00:40.440> amputee<00:00:40.980> at
