00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
great for organizing things instead of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.570 
great for organizing things instead of
you<00:03:10.170> seem<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.530> humongous<00:03:11.130> binders

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you seem like a humongous binders

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.280 
you seem like a humongous binders
because<00:03:12.210> at<00:03:12.300> my<00:03:12.390> school<00:03:12.690> each<00:03:13.050> teacher

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
because at my school each teacher

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
because at my school each teacher
specifies<00:03:14.010> what<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.520> need<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.940> class

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
specifies what you need for that class

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.229 
specifies what you need for that class

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
and so what I did is just get like a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.180 
and so what I did is just get like a
little<00:03:18.300> folder<00:03:19.140> either<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.620> each<00:03:19.680> class<00:03:19.890> or

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
