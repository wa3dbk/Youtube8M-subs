 hey that back friends of youtube them 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.180
 you can go to play morire transas a theme 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.639
 nice for those who are half 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 hurting whether we have demonstration 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.330
 of this side and letter of chords in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.910
 information I leave the link so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.230
 ok let's start perfect tuning 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.230
 standard and we start with an arpeggio 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 chickens 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.410
 perfect let's occupy sun 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.960
 do not see that here the trick 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.810
 is not to take off the two fingers from below 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.280
 nothing else those of above we lowered them 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.120
 after my minor 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.360
 the network we're going to start with the arpeggio 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.190

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.610
 second third after again first 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.610
 second third 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.740
 and then we played second fret first 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.070
 rope with the number one finger is to lower it 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 nothing else 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.670
 faster 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 same we start now fifth and first 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.610
 and we repeat only again 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 then we passed to my minor 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.299
 we played equal sixth first first 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.299
 after third third second third 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.530
 then in the is the same arpeggio nothing 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.950
 more change the patching now is in the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.950
 fifth 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.790
 and between nothing else the art hjos towards 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.790
 down we play first fourth and first 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 ok let's do everything at speed 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580
 half 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360
 and 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 we change to me 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.380
 and now king 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.250
 perfect now let's take a strum 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.290
 to join the two stanzas the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.440
 Arpeggio is used in a small part 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.030
 of the song the fingers the sun and this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.000
 good radio in half 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.830
 let's use the number 1 finger to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 put it on the number 2 fret of the 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.030
 rope 1 after exactly the semi 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.030
 mute or check first as I do 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.400
 ok after exactly the arrows 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.400
 blue of the semi mute or change the finger 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.130
 to the rope 1 that minute nothing else anymore 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.590
 you know relax your hand here if you 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.970
 appreciate I'm here pushing hard and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.080
 when the fights appear in blue 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.080
 I relax my hand 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.200
 slower 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.540
 and nothing more and nothing else after 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.709
 we add the classic chucuya sanz that 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.709
 downhill up 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.700
 its quota 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.190
 a boy 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.110
 ok go practice first so slow 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.620
 slow and then the same strum is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.780
 for me nothing more that does not change what 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.150
 we do complete we do not have to do 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 no change we do complete the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.880
 strum ok I 'm going to put them now like this 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.880
 letter to be identified 3 2 1 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.260

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.820
 and king 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.510
 and the strumming comes 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.470
 all right 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.510
 and there we will start with the chorus when 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.240

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.460

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.910

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:19.580

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:22.909

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.139
 make an account again we stay 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.139
 for the final part of the stanza 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.680
 because I'm not here anymore 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.639

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.300

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.800
