00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and the rest of the truck now in my case

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550

that<00:00:26.220> cut<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> smell<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.420> maybe<00:00:27.779> half<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that cut the smell by maybe half but it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.089 
that cut the smell by maybe half but it
was<00:00:28.680> still<00:00:28.890> terrible<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> another<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
was still terrible so another thing you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
was still terrible so another thing you
can<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.270> smoke<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
can do is is the smoke is also going to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
can do is is the smoke is also going to
live<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> seats<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.219> old<00:00:35.370> car

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
live in the seats and if it's an old car

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.860 
live in the seats and if it's an old car
they're<00:00:35.760> probably<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.149> dirty<00:00:36.360> anyway<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
they're probably pretty dirty anyway so

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.729 
they're probably pretty dirty anyway so
get<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.920> foam<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> upholstery<00:00:38.850> cleaner<00:00:39.739> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
cleaner scrubbed your carpets and then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
cleaner scrubbed your carpets and then

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that worked well and we were doing okay

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
that worked well and we were doing okay
but<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.140> still<00:01:04.199> stank<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.739> cigarettes<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.350 
but it's still stank like cigarettes and
I<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.610> were<00:01:05.729> probably<00:01:07.189> 60%<00:01:08.189> better<00:01:08.610> than<00:01:08.970> than

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I we were probably 60% better than than

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
I we were probably 60% better than than
it<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> got

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it was when I got it and so then I got

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.410 
it was when I got it and so then I got
some<00:01:11.760> Glade<00:01:12.799> which<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.040> same<00:01:14.760> concept<00:01:15.299> as

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
some Glade which is same concept as

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
some Glade which is same concept as
Febreze<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> different<00:01:16.259> concept<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> then

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
Febreze but a different concept so then

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060 
Febreze but a different concept so then
I<00:01:17.310> spray<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> again<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.619> including

worked<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.220> me<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.910> was

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
worked for me but this this was

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.850 
worked for me but this this was
particularly<00:02:41.480> nasty<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.380> then<00:02:42.650> another

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
particularly nasty and then another

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.410 
particularly nasty and then another
thing<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.580> course<00:02:43.760> helps<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.270> whenever

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
thing that of course helps is whenever

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.960 
thing that of course helps is whenever
I'm<00:02:44.630> home<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.850> leave<00:02:46.850> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
I'm home with it I just leave the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.150 
I'm home with it I just leave the
windows<00:02:47.270> open<00:02:47.420> out<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.260> sunlight<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.010> can

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
windows open out the sunlight so it can

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.259 
windows open out the sunlight so it can
kind<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.430> breeze<00:02:49.940> out<00:02:50.209> cook<00:02:50.720> out<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:53.239> I

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
kind of breeze out cook out of it so I

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.759 
kind of breeze out cook out of it so I
hope<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.480> works<00:02:53.780> for<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.410> thing<00:02:54.620> was

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
hope that works for you this thing was

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.989 
hope that works for you this thing was
disgusting<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.120> now<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.450> bearable
