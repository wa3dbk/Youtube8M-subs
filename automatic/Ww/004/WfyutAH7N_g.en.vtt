actually section off two pieces here on
the<00:00:17.970> side<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:19.080> begin<00:00:19.439> braiding<00:00:19.830> down

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the side and just begin braiding down

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.330 
the side and just begin braiding down
like<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.900> extension<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.039> just

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
like so with that extension here so just

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.790 
like so with that extension here so just
start<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.840> half<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.320> braid<00:00:25.529> just

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
start there with like half a braid just

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
start there with like half a braid just
going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> way<00:00:26.189> down<00:00:26.369> making<00:00:26.609> sure<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.939> not

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
going to way down making sure it's not

going to way down making sure it's not
too<00:00:27.420> too<00:00:27.630> tight<00:00:27.980> once<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.099> completed<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
too too tight once I completed that just

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
too too tight once I completed that just
switch<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> other<00:00:31.230> side<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
switch up do it on the other side and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
switch up do it on the other side and
complete<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> product<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:35.930> once<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> complete

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
complete that product so once I complete

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.110 
complete that product so once I complete
both<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> those<00:00:37.950> braids<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:38.969> get

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
both of those braids I can really get

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060 
both of those braids I can really get
down<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> braiding<00:00:39.870> process<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
down with the braiding process so when I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
down with the braiding process so when I
braid<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> let<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.270> hang

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
braid that in just kind of let it hang

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
braid that in just kind of let it hang
for<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> minute<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.590> I'm<00:00:43.710> basically<00:00:44.010> just

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
for a minute now I'm basically just

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.889 
for a minute now I'm basically just
going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> part<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> section<00:00:45.120> across<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.629> top

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to part a section across the top

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
going to part a section across the top
and<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.550> way

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and I'm just going to go all the way

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
and I'm just going to go all the way
around<00:00:47.960> following<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.110> shape<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
around following that shape that I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
around following that shape that I
already<00:00:49.829> created<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.730> those<00:00:50.910> few<00:00:51.210> braids

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
already created with those few braids

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
already created with those few braids
going<00:00:51.750> around<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
going around and I'm just going to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
going around and I'm just going to
continue<00:00:54.180> braiding<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.469> around<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
continue braiding all the way around so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
continue braiding all the way around so
using<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> weaving<00:00:57.300> hair<00:00:57.510> there

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
using a little bit of weaving hair there

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
using a little bit of weaving hair there
to<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> keep<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> nice<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:58.920> taut<00:00:59.460> um

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to just to keep it nice and taut um

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
to just to keep it nice and taut um
cross<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> hair<00:01:01.350> line<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.920> basically<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
cross a hair line I'm basically just

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
cross a hair line I'm basically just
going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> keep<00:01:03.090> braiding<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.840> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
going to keep braiding and it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
going to keep braiding and it's
essential<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> keep<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.220> first<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.790> least<00:01:05.909> two

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
essential to keep the first at least two

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
essential to keep the first at least two
braids<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.960> thin<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.369> going

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
braids very thin because those are going

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
braids very thin because those are going
to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.729> most<00:01:08.909> significant<00:01:09.570> brace<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to be your most significant brace out of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
to be your most significant brace out of
the<00:01:10.260> whole<00:01:10.409> pattern<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.670> hands

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the whole pattern now I know my hands

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
the whole pattern now I know my hands
are<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> double<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.500> took

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
are going to double time because it took

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.060 
are going to double time because it took
me<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:14.090> 45<00:01:15.090> minutes<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.680> complete

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
me about 45 minutes or so to complete

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
me about 45 minutes or so to complete
this<00:01:17.310> whole<00:01:17.520> process<00:01:17.759> maybe<00:01:18.720> thirty<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this whole process maybe thirty to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
this whole process maybe thirty to
forty-five<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.250> sped<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.299> for

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
forty-five but I sped it up just for

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
forty-five but I sped it up just for
your<00:01:21.780> sake<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> didn't<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
your sake time so you didn't have to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.330 
your sake time so you didn't have to
watch<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.490> much<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.710> altering<00:01:26.159> my

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
watch as much but I'm not altering my

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
watch as much but I'm not altering my
braiding<00:01:26.729> pattern<00:01:27.030> whatsoever<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.080> once

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
braiding pattern whatsoever so once

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
braiding pattern whatsoever so once
those<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:28.530> braids<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.159> created<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> start

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
those two braids are created and I start

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
those two braids are created and I start
going<00:01:30.630> around<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.079> circular<00:01:31.350> pattern<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:32.070> kind

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
going around a circular pattern or kind

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
going around a circular pattern or kind
of<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> square<00:01:32.909> almost<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.350> going

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
of like a square almost it's just going

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260 
of like a square almost it's just going
to<00:01:34.590> keep<00:01:34.740> following<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> same<00:01:35.670> pattern<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to keep following that same pattern and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
to keep following that same pattern and
you'll<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.720> notice<00:01:37.140> once<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you'll actually notice once you get to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
you'll actually notice once you get to
the<00:01:38.610> middle<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.119> about<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.360> approach<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the middle as I'm about to approach it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.929 
the middle as I'm about to approach it's
going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> start<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.189> get<00:01:41.340> tighter<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
going to start to get tighter and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.249 
going to start to get tighter and
tighter<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.600> you're<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
tighter so you're going to have to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
tighter so you're going to have to
adjust<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.740> hands<00:01:44.189> each<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> go

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
adjust your hands each way that you go

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
adjust your hands each way that you go
around<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.780> making<00:01:46.500> sure<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> everything

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
around so making sure that everything

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
around so making sure that everything
stays<00:01:47.399> flat<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.149> essential<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.920> being

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
stays flat is essential and not being

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.920 
stays flat is essential and not being
afraid<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> mess<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.869> if

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
afraid to go back if you mess up so if

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.830 
afraid to go back if you mess up so if
you<00:01:51.990> feel<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> lump<00:01:52.470> definitely<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.579> back
