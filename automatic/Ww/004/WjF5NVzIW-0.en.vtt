or<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.740> less<00:04:10.950> austere<00:04:11.910> be<00:04:14.900> now<00:04:15.900> cool<00:04:17.390> so

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
or on the less austere be now cool so

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.170 
or on the less austere be now cool so
then<00:04:18.690> we<00:04:18.959> will<00:04:20.090> get<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.299> one<00:04:21.480> this<00:04:22.170> lie<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:23.180> now

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
then we will get the one this lie in now

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.010 
then we will get the one this lie in now
the<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:25.170> other<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.710> we<00:04:26.490> will<00:04:26.670> put<00:04:26.880> one<00:04:27.240> Montana

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
the the other in we will put one Montana

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.610 
the the other in we will put one Montana
and<00:04:28.380> then<00:04:29.160> we<00:04:29.340> will<00:04:29.550> tie<00:04:29.790> not<00:04:30.080> right<00:04:31.080> away<00:04:31.290> with

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and then we will tie not right away with

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.660 
and then we will tie not right away with
the<00:04:31.920> other<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.310> right<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:38.130> get<00:04:38.370> one

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
the other in so right now you get one

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.740 
the other in so right now you get one
wing<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:40.280> we<00:04:41.280> will<00:04:41.430> do<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.790> same<00:04:42.000> with<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
wing in we will do the same with the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.630 
wing in we will do the same with the
other<00:04:42.900> side<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.300> now<00:04:45.480> we<00:04:45.540> got<00:04:45.930> both<00:04:46.560> wings<00:04:47.190> in

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
see five crystal and one Montana put

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.270 
see five crystal and one Montana put
that<00:05:01.169> red<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.370> new<00:05:02.790> line<00:05:03.480> right<00:05:04.080> in<00:05:04.320> put<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:04.980> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
that red in new line right in put in the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.610 
that red in new line right in put in the
second<00:05:06.240> crystal<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:08.340> left<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.940> the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
second crystal on the left of the

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.750 
second crystal on the left of the
Montana<00:05:11.570> now<00:05:12.570> we<00:05:12.840> will<00:05:13.110> put<00:05:13.350> together<00:05:13.590> both<00:05:14.400> in

push to a patch and then we'll pass read
in<00:06:13.170> into<00:06:14.170> the<00:06:14.920> crystal<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:16.000> third<00:06:16.240> crystal

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
in into the crystal the third crystal

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.350 
in into the crystal the third crystal
not<00:06:17.290> in<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.620> middle<00:06:17.920> we<00:06:18.430> skip<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.970> middle<00:06:19.300> of
