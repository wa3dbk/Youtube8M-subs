00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
than explore which I also thought might

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.930

played two in the sideboard but I

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.949 
played two in the sideboard but I
decided<00:04:04.799> against<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.310> sir<00:04:05.610> but<00:04:06.390> now<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959

was<00:04:35.509> a<00:04:35.600> huge<00:04:35.870> mistake<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.380> talked<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.590> him

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
was a huge mistake I talked to him

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
that good in the deck I think that you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.340 
that good in the deck I think that you

to<00:04:53.720> protect<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.199> or<00:04:54.289> like<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:55.100> don't<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.580> a

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
to protect it or like you don't have a

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.189

all<00:04:57.350> their<00:04:57.500> other<00:04:57.590> guys<00:04:57.860> so<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.669> don't<00:04:59.270> think<00:04:59.389> a

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
all their other guys so I don't think a

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.790 
all their other guys so I don't think a
liliana<00:04:59.750> was<00:04:59.900> great<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.169> deck<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.560> think

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
liliana was great in the deck I think

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.110 
liliana was great in the deck I think
that<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.070> have<00:05:01.190> way<00:05:01.400> too<00:05:01.460> many<00:05:01.639> other<00:05:01.850> cool

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that you have way too many other cool

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.300 
that you have way too many other cool
things<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.479> be<00:05:02.570> doing<00:05:02.720> her<00:05:03.710> plus<00:05:03.949> one<00:05:04.039> ability

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
things to be doing her plus one ability

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.670 
things to be doing her plus one ability
is<00:05:04.580> good<00:05:04.820> but<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.479> already<00:05:05.630> have<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.080> engine

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
is good but you already have that engine

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.000 
is good but you already have that engine
with<00:05:07.160> Ravens<00:05:07.610> crime<00:05:07.760> in<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:07.970> deck<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:09.199> just

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
with Ravens crime in the deck and I just

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.710 
with Ravens crime in the deck and I just
thought<00:05:10.130> all<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.820> abilities<00:05:11.150> were<00:05:11.300> kind<00:05:11.600> of

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
thought all the abilities were kind of

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.750 
thought all the abilities were kind of
just<00:05:11.949> things<00:05:12.949> are<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:13.130> already<00:05:13.250> trying<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.610> do

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
just things are you already trying to do

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.159 
just things are you already trying to do
and<00:05:13.880> things<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.270> other<00:05:14.570> things<00:05:14.900> do<00:05:15.050> it

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
and things that other things do it

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.980 
and things that other things do it
better<00:05:15.320> absolutely<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:16.370> going<00:05:17.360> forward<00:05:17.660> what

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
better absolutely so going forward what

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.620 
better absolutely so going forward what
do<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.169> think<00:05:18.349> you<00:05:18.530> would<00:05:18.650> change<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.370> day

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
do you think you would change to the day

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.740 
do you think you would change to the day
so<00:05:20.630> far<00:05:20.830> maybe<00:05:21.830> add<00:05:22.160> a<00:05:22.190> basic<00:05:22.729> forest<00:05:23.300> cut<00:05:23.599> down

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
so far maybe add a basic forest cut down

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.180 
so far maybe add a basic forest cut down
on<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.990> Red<00:05:24.110> sources<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.560> little<00:05:24.770> bit<00:05:24.889> I've
