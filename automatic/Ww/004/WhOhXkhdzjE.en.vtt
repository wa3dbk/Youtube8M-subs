Olivia<00:00:04.410> so<00:00:04.680> it's<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.010> to<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.609> rally<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
Olivia so it's on to the rally of

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.590 
Olivia so it's on to the rally of
Portugal<00:00:07.220> this<00:00:08.220> one's<00:00:08.430> actually<00:00:08.600> reasonably

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
Portugal this one's actually reasonably

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.850 
Portugal this one's actually reasonably
easy<00:00:09.840> compared<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> some<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> ones<00:00:10.680> we've

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
easy compared to some of the ones we've

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.249 
easy compared to some of the ones we've
come<00:00:11.010> up<00:00:11.099> against<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.490> far<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.030> car<00:00:12.480> slides

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
come up against so far the car slides

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.520 
come up against so far the car slides
nicely<00:00:13.910> it's<00:00:14.910> quite<00:00:15.120> predictable<00:00:15.809> there's<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
nicely it's quite predictable there's a

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.930 
nicely it's quite predictable there's a
couple<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.830> challenging<00:00:17.310> corners<00:00:17.700> here<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
couple of challenging corners here and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
couple of challenging corners here and
there<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:18.330> generally<00:00:18.660> speaking<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
there but generally speaking you get to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.110 
there but generally speaking you get to
get<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.860> nice<00:00:20.040> feel<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.610> car<00:00:20.790> and<00:00:21.030> it's

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
get a nice feel for the car and it's

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.330 
get a nice feel for the car and it's
some<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.560> some<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.620> the<00:00:22.680> stages<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:23.040> quite

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
some of the some of the stages are quite

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
some of the some of the stages are quite
wide<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:23.880> course<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.120> one<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.360> a<00:00:24.510> nice

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
wide and of course this one is a nice

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
wide and of course this one is a nice
open<00:00:25.430> introduction<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.610> it<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:26.820> well<00:00:26.970> well

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
open introduction to it as well well

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.890 
open introduction to it as well well
let's<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.540> look

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
let's take a look

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
let's take a look
so<00:00:28.830> Portugal<00:00:30.650> much<00:00:31.650> more<00:00:31.830> sandy<00:00:32.279> texture<00:00:32.640> now

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so Portugal much more sandy texture now

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.190 
so Portugal much more sandy texture now
so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> slide<00:00:33.840> completely

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so this is going to slide completely

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.880 
so this is going to slide completely
differently<00:00:34.739> quickly<00:00:35.550> away<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:37.560> can<00:00:37.680> see

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
differently quickly away and you can see

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.730 
differently quickly away and you can see
the<00:00:38.040> onboard<00:00:38.460> view<00:00:41.990> that<00:00:42.990> bump<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.500> hard

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
the onboard view that bump quite hard

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.240 
the onboard view that bump quite hard
they're<00:00:44.360> back<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.540> using<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> fnatic<00:00:46.620> CSR

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
they're back to using the fnatic CSR

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.280 
they're back to using the fnatic CSR
elite<00:00:47.490> will<00:00:47.700> I'm<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.360> comfortable<00:00:48.540> on<00:00:49.170> this

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
elite will I'm very comfortable on this

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.500 
elite will I'm very comfortable on this
game<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:50.489> nice<00:00:50.640> feel<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> force

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
game really nice feel through the force

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
game really nice feel through the force
feedback<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.040> wheel<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.760> power

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
feedback on it that wheel has some power

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
feedback on it that wheel has some power
when<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> comes<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> force<00:00:54.870> feedback<00:00:55.290> I<00:00:55.320> can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
when it comes to force feedback I can

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
when it comes to force feedback I can
tell<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.270> especially<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> damage

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
tell you that especially when you damage

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.000 
tell you that especially when you damage
your<00:00:58.020> car<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.100> feel<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.730> same

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
your car you really do feel the same

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
your car you really do feel the same
misalignment<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.280> wheels<00:01:02.570> etc<00:01:03.570> through

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
misalignment of your wheels etc through

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.289 
misalignment of your wheels etc through
the<00:01:03.989> force<00:01:04.680> feedback

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
the force feedback

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.999 
the force feedback
now<00:01:06.299> obviously<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.110> texture<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.530> quite<00:01:07.740> tidy

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
now obviously the texture is quite tidy

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.370 
now obviously the texture is quite tidy
so<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.810> need<00:01:09.929> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.200> quite

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so you really do need to be quite

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.980 
so you really do need to be quite
focused<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.920> where<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.280> putting<00:01:11.639> the<00:01:11.729> car

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
focused on where you're putting the car

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
focused on where you're putting the car
you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.170> lose<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> lot<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.859> time<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.999> not

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you can lose a lot of time by not

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.169 
you can lose a lot of time by not
getting<00:01:15.359> it<00:01:15.600> into<00:01:15.869> certain<00:01:16.200> corners<00:01:17.179> there's

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
getting it into certain corners there's

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.660 
getting it into certain corners there's
a<00:01:18.299> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.539> understeer<00:01:19.139> with<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.219> loss<00:01:20.459> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a lot of understeer with the loss of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.779 
a lot of understeer with the loss of
grip<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:22.039> often<00:01:23.039> turning<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.520> quite

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
grip so you're often turning in quite

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.830 
grip so you're often turning in quite
early<00:01:23.969> to<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.689> aggressively<00:01:24.899> take<00:01:25.499> money

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
early to really aggressively take money

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
early to really aggressively take money
one<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:27.959> like<00:01:28.109> that<00:01:28.319> I'm<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.889> bit

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
one was like that I'm using a little bit

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.559 
one was like that I'm using a little bit
of<00:01:29.130> extra<00:01:29.609> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.630> side<00:01:30.859> to<00:01:31.859> avoid<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
of extra on the side to avoid the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.249 
of extra on the side to avoid the
obstacles<00:01:33.569> always<00:01:33.990> aware<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.529> the<00:01:34.709> course

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
obstacles always aware of the course

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.019 
obstacles always aware of the course
quite<00:01:37.259> turned<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.979> again<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.429> did<00:01:38.609> get

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
quite turned in but again they did get

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:40.519 
quite turned in but again they did get
on<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.240> brakes<00:01:39.479> early<00:01:39.840> enough<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.289> didn't

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
on the brakes early enough so didn't

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:47.580 
on the brakes early enough so didn't
punch<00:01:40.770> him<00:01:40.950> hard<00:01:41.459> enough<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> car<00:01:42.779> in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.849 

right<00:01:48.119> through<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.299> tricky<00:01:49.659> section<00:01:50.170> more

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
right through this tricky section more

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.380 
right through this tricky section more
tricky<00:01:51.159> than<00:01:51.189> it<00:01:51.429> looks<00:01:51.640> actually<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.179> looks

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
tricky than it looks actually it looks

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.240 
tricky than it looks actually it looks
quite<00:01:52.719> wide<00:01:52.929> there<00:01:53.289> but<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.590> reality<00:01:53.740> when

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
quite wide there but in reality when

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.840 
quite wide there but in reality when
you're<00:01:54.369> driving<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.880> one<00:01:55.060> line<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> if<00:01:57.729> you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you're driving this one line so if you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.630 
you're driving this one line so if you
make<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> mistake<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:59.189> get<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.219> wheel<00:02:00.429> out

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
make a mistake and just get a wheel out

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.870 
make a mistake and just get a wheel out
of<00:02:00.789> place<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.329> can<00:02:01.539> often<00:02:02.159> roll<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.340> car<00:02:03.549> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
of place it can often roll the car and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.650 
of place it can often roll the car and
into<00:02:04.509> your<00:02:05.409> rally<00:02:06.009> entirely<00:02:09.539> into<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
into your rally entirely into the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.039 
into your rally entirely into the
shadows<00:02:11.970> there<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.090> some<00:02:13.299> tricky<00:02:13.629> corners

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
shadows there are some tricky corners

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.800 
shadows there are some tricky corners
here<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:14.769> very<00:02:14.920> dark<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.360> from<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.599> light

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
here it's very dark so from the light

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.479 
here it's very dark so from the light
into<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> darkness<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.769> again<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.190> over

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
into the darkness and again I over

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.870 
into the darkness and again I over
steered<00:02:21.819> there<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> bit<00:02:24.430> slow<00:02:24.610> in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
steered there so I was a bit slow in

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880 
steered there so I was a bit slow in
that<00:02:25.000> section<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.079> shadow<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.620> caught

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that section and the shadow just caught

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.949 
that section and the shadow just caught
me<00:02:27.069> off<00:02:27.190> guard<00:02:27.220> slightly<00:02:29.310> lots<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.459> bumps

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
me off guard slightly lots of bumps

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.449 
me off guard slightly lots of bumps
trying<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.049> keep<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> car<00:02:32.500> nice<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.920> balanced

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
trying to keep the car nice and balanced

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.789 
trying to keep the car nice and balanced
so<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.180> better<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.540> slow<00:02:35.049> right<00:02:35.079> down<00:02:35.560> like

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
so it's better to slow right down like

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.539 
so it's better to slow right down like
that<00:02:36.010> get<00:02:36.310> control<00:02:36.760> again<00:02:37.150> rather<00:02:37.510> than

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
that get control again rather than

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.890 
that get control again rather than
completely<00:02:39.549> lose<00:02:39.819> balance<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> car<00:02:40.720> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
completely lose balance in the car and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.920 
completely lose balance in the car and
start<00:02:41.140> sliding<00:02:41.410> all<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.890> place

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.770 

downhill

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.830 

on<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> power<00:02:50.800> up<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.100> fourth<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> then

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
on the power up to fourth and then

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.390 
on the power up to fourth and then
you're<00:02:52.990> breaking<00:02:53.380> nice<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.830> early<00:02:53.920> nice<00:02:54.250> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
you're breaking nice and early nice and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550 
you're breaking nice and early nice and
comfortable<00:02:54.880> down<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.330> second<00:02:55.750> didn't

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
comfortable down to the second didn't

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.870 
comfortable down to the second didn't
quite<00:02:56.709> get<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> slide<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.370> as<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.610> would<00:02:57.730> like

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
quite get the slide in as I would like

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.900 
quite get the slide in as I would like
but<00:02:59.520> that<00:03:00.520> was<00:03:00.670> okay<00:03:02.580> sometimes<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.730> need<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
but that was okay sometimes you need to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.380 
but that was okay sometimes you need to
be<00:03:05.190> questioning<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:06.340> which<00:03:06.910> gear<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
be questioning you know which gear you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.120 
be questioning you know which gear you
need<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> think<00:03:07.959> again<00:03:08.080> like<00:03:08.440> say<00:03:08.650> second

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
need and I think again like say second

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.530 
need and I think again like say second
gear<00:03:09.310> was<00:03:09.459> working<00:03:09.819> well<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.180> me<00:03:10.239> there<00:03:10.390> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
gear was working well for me there you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.970 
gear was working well for me there you
don't<00:03:10.660> always<00:03:10.900> need<00:03:11.140> first<00:03:11.440> gear<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
don't always need first gear on a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.600 
don't always need first gear on a
hairpin<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:14.650> really<00:03:14.860> does<00:03:15.010> depend<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
hairpin it really does depend on the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.520 
hairpin it really does depend on the
texture<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.510> hairpin<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.140> shape<00:03:17.350> of

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
texture of the hairpin and the shape of

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.840 
texture of the hairpin and the shape of
it<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.770> it's<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.980> V<00:03:18.160> shape<00:03:18.489> then<00:03:18.730> obviously

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
it if it's a V shape then obviously

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.699 
it if it's a V shape then obviously
you'll<00:03:19.630> always<00:03:19.750> be<00:03:19.989> straight<00:03:20.200> down<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.530> first

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you'll always be straight down at first

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.280 
you'll always be straight down at first
but<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.880> nice<00:03:22.060> curvature<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:22.870> opening

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
but the nice curvature and it's opening

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.360 
but the nice curvature and it's opening
and<00:03:23.560> second<00:03:24.070> gear<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.280> adequate<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:27.220> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
and second gear is adequate so the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.880 
and second gear is adequate so the
latter<00:03:27.550> half<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.090> stage<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:29.470> back<00:03:29.709> up

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
latter half of this stage going back up

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.490 
latter half of this stage going back up
hill<00:03:30.130> again<00:03:32.459> much<00:03:33.459> narrower<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.209> section

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
hill again much narrower in this section

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.080 
hill again much narrower in this section
this<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.709> tricky<00:03:36.069> couple<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.489> corners<00:03:36.819> here

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
this is a tricky couple of corners here

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.350 
this is a tricky couple of corners here
little<00:03:37.569> bit<00:03:37.690> slower<00:03:38.910> do<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:39.970> want<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.180> cut

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
little bit slower do you want to cut

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.340 
little bit slower do you want to cut
that<00:03:40.510> slightly<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:43.690> got<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:43.989> slightly

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
that slightly just got that slightly

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.800 
that slightly just got that slightly
wrong<00:03:44.680> there<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:44.950> turned<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.730> over<00:03:46.090> stage<00:03:46.390> had

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
wrong there I turned in I over stage had

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.090 
wrong there I turned in I over stage had
to<00:03:46.930> avoid<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.200> rock<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.830> then<00:03:47.920> that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
to avoid the rock and then that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.460 
to avoid the rock and then that
compromised<00:03:48.670> my<00:03:48.910> exit<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:53.080> through<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
compromised my exit and now through the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.310 
compromised my exit and now through the
final<00:03:53.920> corners<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.420> stage<00:03:55.750> one<00:03:56.079> or

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
final corners and that is stage one or

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.940 
final corners and that is stage one or
the<00:03:57.040> portugal<00:03:57.579> rally

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.460 

so<00:04:00.950> Randhir<00:04:01.310> Portugal<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:02.090> bit<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.990> messy<00:04:03.290> end

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
so Randhir Portugal a bit of a messy end

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.840 
so Randhir Portugal a bit of a messy end
wasn't<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.100> at<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> end<00:04:04.520> of<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.670> day

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
wasn't it but at the end of the day

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.550 
wasn't it but at the end of the day
again<00:04:05.450> still<00:04:05.840> learning<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.290> know<00:04:06.410> when

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
again still learning you know when

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.350 
again still learning you know when
you've<00:04:06.710> moved<00:04:07.250> from<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:07.670> rally<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:08.090> another

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
you've moved from one rally to another

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690 
you've moved from one rally to another
you<00:04:09.350> can<00:04:09.380> see<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.800> difference<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
you can see the difference in the

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.060 
you can see the difference in the
textures<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.390> certain<00:04:11.930> areas<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.470> ways<00:04:13.040> in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
textures and certain areas and ways in

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.590 
textures and certain areas and ways in
which<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.400> was<00:04:13.460> using<00:04:13.520> a<00:04:13.790> hand<00:04:14.030> break<00:04:14.240> I<00:04:14.450> now

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
which I was using a hand break I now

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.160 
which I was using a hand break I now
have<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.900> alter<00:04:15.530> those<00:04:15.680> ways<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.690> adapt<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.110> I

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
have to alter those ways to adapt and I

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.390 
have to alter those ways to adapt and I
think<00:04:18.410> again<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.040> shows<00:04:19.250> the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
think again it just shows the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.040
