00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.049
 the judge continues to promise the players a gameplay never seen 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.390
 new ways of understanding videogames 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.519
 endless possibilities that will amaze the human race 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.089
 unfortunately the developers do not know but remotely 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.949
 for fulfilling the promises of the great n 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.510
 to speak of Corinth we have to go back to the past of humanity 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.630
 in which a game like marvel madness was novel 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 but of course that was before other games like super montíboli came out 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 the sale since then we have been able to do the ball monkey dance is in 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.440
 mini format game titles like rayman raving rabbids little allowed 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.950
 so we can get an idea this game is included in the genre of 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.540
 simulators of balls that move on platforms that float in the sky like this 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 that we can manage by moving the command so that the world tilts and so the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.790
 ball roll to the goal 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.380
 well it has explained quickly and hard it seems that we meet with hugo 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.060
 gomez very unpretentious 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.550
 but the truth is that it's not like that it's a simple little pretentious game and 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 presumably 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.009
 if our wrist twist allows us and without wanting to cause us 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.150
 some injury 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.260
 in recent form we will have to move the command so that the platform limited 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.030
 our movements on the screen as game novelties allows layoffs 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.440
 more than 180 degrees 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.540
 so that by complying with the physical laws the pola can do 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 unsuspected moves and more risky 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.160
 and little more than commenting on the gameplay that the turns are more 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.740
 pronounced that the super montíboli easy and that does not include the mini-games 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.930
 that did include the wii version the title of sega 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.390
 our eagerness to finish levels and more levels will be relegated in this 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390
 occasion to unlock hidden elements of the game 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.960
 we can play with a ball in the shape of a penguin or pig dog 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.780
 each of the balls has its own special features a few boots 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.690
 more others are faster 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.120
 you can also hear how the pet dog and how each of the balls 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 has its own sound through the speaker 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.650
 and in case this seemed like your son because it would be the most normal also 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.529
 will unlock new levels and new music 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.799
 the zinc this game is not the best on the web but neither is it the worst 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.229
 It is so unoriginal that it becomes free 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.709
 has a two-player mode that you can ask for more
