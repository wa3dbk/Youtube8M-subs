00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
 dogs you know are man's best friends how hard it is 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.500
 train 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.280
 the dog will depend on dogs that first learn the dogs they learn later 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.629
 exactly like kids at school 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.789
 and depending on the hand take, the difficulty then still depends 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.529
 always from the master what kind of master to this channel 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.640
 more the master 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.989
 he is convinced of what the dog is doing is trained millet 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.649
 there is a breed of dog that beautiful in the summer more easily than 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.849
 other 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.060
 definitely not for all dogs can be trained including the mythical 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 there is no difference 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.850
 absolutely 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.880
 the use of the too little houses of canada and states that have assaulted master words 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.559
 in this 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 case as second of the spongiosa never what I can go down 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 but generally 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's not the dogs to be bad people are to be bad depends on 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.280
 what made the dog owner 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 same speech maps specifically and these dogs looking at roads here ad 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.019
 alcamo ank also have the function 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.510
 of the social status pallanza are served 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.930
 but we still have no culture and culture just time to have it 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.720
 is there today 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.990
 if we succeed in having a culture that we have opened after 3 years and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.860
 yet 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.050
 there is now we hope will continue 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.480
 dog ride 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 slowly if a penis level arrives 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.180
 more concrete or cm 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.880
 yet 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.330
 physically arrived at the right point 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.160
 how long it takes to train a dog 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.179
 depends on what you can do a soluble gig in the sauna meter 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.609
 if instead you have to get to levels to connect blogspot are out of the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:42.330
 sowing

 to the carabinieri for finance in Naples 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 police 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.920
 you have to be more with dogs you have to find a friendship 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.400
 sincere friendship 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.620
 because the thirst that a dog can give you is how I understand a dog 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.270
 better than people 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 table calendar if 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.250
