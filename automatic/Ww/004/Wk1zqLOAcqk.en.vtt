Rosario fitness just got out of the gym
and<00:00:07.040> was<00:00:07.250> thinking<00:00:07.490> about<00:00:07.549> a<00:00:07.640> question<00:00:07.940> that

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.270 
and was thinking about a question that

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.730 
and was thinking about a question that
people<00:00:08.389> have<00:00:08.570> been<00:00:08.750> asking<00:00:09.110> me<00:00:09.230> a<00:00:09.260> lot<00:00:09.559> lately

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
people have been asking me a lot lately

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.169 
people have been asking me a lot lately
and<00:00:09.980> something<00:00:10.370> I<00:00:10.460> used<00:00:10.670> to<00:00:10.760> think<00:00:10.910> about

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
and something I used to think about

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.089 
and something I used to think about
myself<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:11.780> whether<00:00:12.469> or<00:00:12.590> not<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:12.769> should<00:00:12.800> put

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
myself and whether or not you should put

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.600 
myself and whether or not you should put
deadlifts<00:00:13.790> on<00:00:13.910> leg<00:00:14.870> day<00:00:15.080> on<00:00:15.290> upper<00:00:15.950> body<00:00:15.980> lower

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
deadlifts on leg day on upper body lower

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.310 
deadlifts on leg day on upper body lower
body<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.090> how<00:00:17.210> you<00:00:17.270> fit<00:00:17.599> them<00:00:17.720> into<00:00:17.900> do

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
body and how you fit them into do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.750 
body and how you fit them into do
deadlifts<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:18.830> squats<00:00:18.920> on<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.310> same<00:00:19.580> day

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
deadlifts and squats on the same day

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.029 
deadlifts and squats on the same day
really<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.840> simplest<00:00:21.140> answer<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.560> do

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
really the simplest answer is do

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.609 
really the simplest answer is do
whatever<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:22.939> want<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.420> do<00:00:23.630> how<00:00:24.109> do<00:00:24.170> you<00:00:24.380> feel

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
whatever you want to do how do you feel

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.380 
whatever you want to do how do you feel
the<00:00:24.770> best<00:00:24.980> most<00:00:25.430> people<00:00:25.789> when<00:00:25.939> they<00:00:26.060> squat

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
the best most people when they squat

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.720 
the best most people when they squat
heavy<00:00:26.689> they're<00:00:27.260> not<00:00:27.470> able<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:27.980> deadlift<00:00:28.340> after

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
heavy they're not able to deadlift after

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.640 
heavy they're not able to deadlift after
that<00:00:28.910> their<00:00:29.300> lower<00:00:29.510> back<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.990> fatigued<00:00:30.380> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
that their lower back is fatigued and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.890 
that their lower back is fatigued and
vice<00:00:31.220> versa<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:31.760> same<00:00:31.970> goes<00:00:32.150> for<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.449> few<00:00:32.660> heavy

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
vice versa the same goes for a few heavy

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.990 
vice versa the same goes for a few heavy
deadlift<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:33.739> probably<00:00:34.250> won't<00:00:34.550> have<00:00:34.760> enough

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
deadlift you probably won't have enough

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.420 
deadlift you probably won't have enough
energy<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.600> heavy<00:00:35.809> squat<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:36.829> that<00:00:37.130> is<00:00:37.280> for

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
energy to heavy squat but that is for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.920 
energy to heavy squat but that is for
the<00:00:37.520> majority<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:38.059> people<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:38.540> know<00:00:38.600> some

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
the majority of people I know some

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.049 
the majority of people I know some
people<00:00:39.260> who<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:40.010> them<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.399> same<00:00:40.670> day<00:00:40.700> along

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
people who do them on the same day along

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.970 
people who do them on the same day along
the<00:00:41.210> bench<00:00:41.420> press<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.260> what<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:42.530> really<00:00:42.800> comes

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
the bench press so what it really comes

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.510 
the bench press so what it really comes
down<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.129> is<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:43.640> works<00:00:43.910> best<00:00:44.180> for<00:00:44.329> you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
down to is what works best for you

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.830 
down to is what works best for you
deadlifting<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:46.670> personally<00:00:47.420> think<00:00:47.660> is<00:00:47.809> a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
deadlifting I personally think is a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.110 
deadlifting I personally think is a
lower<00:00:48.079> back<00:00:48.350> posterior<00:00:49.010> chain<00:00:49.219> exercise<00:00:49.760> I

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
lower back posterior chain exercise I

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.299 
lower back posterior chain exercise I
think<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:50.989> be<00:00:51.140> done<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:51.320> lower<00:00:51.649> day<00:00:51.890> maybe

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
think it can be done on lower day maybe

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.100 
think it can be done on lower day maybe
you<00:00:52.489> can<00:00:52.670> combine<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.180> with<00:00:53.210> front<00:00:53.629> squats<00:00:53.930> if

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can combine it with front squats if

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.170 
you can combine it with front squats if
you<00:00:54.230> do<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.500> on<00:00:54.649> lower<00:00:54.860> day<00:00:55.129> or<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.910> can<00:00:56.059> do<00:00:56.149> it

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
you do it on lower day or you can do it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.900 
you do it on lower day or you can do it
on<00:00:56.500> upper<00:00:57.500> body<00:00:57.530> day<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:58.430> separate<00:00:58.850> your

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
on upper body day and just separate your

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.750 
on upper body day and just separate your
squats<00:00:59.329> do<00:00:59.690> them<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.079> day<00:01:00.289> or<00:01:00.440> two<00:01:00.590> later<00:01:00.760> so

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
squats do them a day or two later so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.819 
squats do them a day or two later so
whatever<00:01:02.180> your<00:01:02.390> split<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.350> work<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:03.739> out

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
whatever your split is just work it out

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.920 
whatever your split is just work it out
so<00:01:04.100> you're<00:01:04.250> able<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.670> hit<00:01:05.089> each<00:01:05.330> lift<00:01:05.690> with

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
so you're able to hit each lift with

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.600 
so you're able to hit each lift with
intensity<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.710> they're<00:01:06.860> not<00:01:07.010> interfering

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
intensity and they're not interfering

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.190 
intensity and they're not interfering
with<00:01:07.640> each<00:01:07.820> other<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:08.750> also<00:01:08.900> try

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
with each other you can also try

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.260 
with each other you can also try
throwing<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.710> stuff<00:01:10.010> like<00:01:10.159> rack<00:01:10.700> poles<00:01:11.000> if

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
throwing in stuff like rack poles if

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.760 
throwing in stuff like rack poles if
you're<00:01:11.420> finding<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.810> hard<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.110> fit<00:01:12.320> deadlifts

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
you're finding it hard to fit deadlifts

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.560 
you're finding it hard to fit deadlifts
into<00:01:12.979> your<00:01:13.100> routine<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.700> could<00:01:14.210> do<00:01:14.299> rack

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
into your routine you could do rack

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.880 
into your routine you could do rack
poles<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.020> squats<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.530> you're<00:01:15.680> mainly

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
poles and squats so you're mainly

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.920 
poles and squats so you're mainly
focusing<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.670> just<00:01:17.000> your<00:01:17.240> lower<00:01:17.390> back<00:01:17.689> during

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
focusing on just your lower back during

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.840 
focusing on just your lower back during
the<00:01:18.080> rack<00:01:18.259> poles<00:01:18.530> taking<00:01:19.220> your<00:01:19.340> legs<00:01:19.580> out<00:01:19.790> of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the rack poles taking your legs out of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.550 
the rack poles taking your legs out of
it<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.840> can<00:01:20.960> do<00:01:21.049> something<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:21.409> a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
it and then you can do something like a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.679 
it and then you can do something like a
Romanian<00:01:22.130> deadlift<00:01:22.549> instead<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.450> there<00:01:23.600> are

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
Romanian deadlift instead so there are

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.420 
Romanian deadlift instead so there are
tons<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.200> different<00:01:24.320> ways<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.799> work<00:01:24.920> deadlifts

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
tons of different ways to work deadlifts

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.580 
tons of different ways to work deadlifts
into<00:01:25.640> your<00:01:25.790> routine<00:01:26.090> again<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.110> hundred

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
into your routine again it's a hundred

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.100 
into your routine again it's a hundred
percent<00:01:27.979> your<00:01:28.250> opinion<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:28.970> how<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.630> feel

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
percent your opinion on how you feel

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.350 
percent your opinion on how you feel
there's<00:01:30.950> really<00:01:31.130> no<00:01:31.340> straight<00:01:31.640> answer<00:01:31.970> you

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
there's really no straight answer you

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.609 
there's really no straight answer you
can<00:01:32.509> go<00:01:32.630> ahead<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.960> look<00:01:33.049> into<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.380> science

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
can go ahead and look into the science
