00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.750
 good in a few words what he has done 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:13.700
 Miguel is that and does not devote more to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.900
 conquer women and that to compete and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.070
 who longs for the capital band 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 but he understood 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 and that's what I understood from him yesterday 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.099
 because I was outraged because I because 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.080
 the production has given me the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.940
 responsibility is the capital then 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.170
 he's always so upset all of a sudden 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.170
 because he wants to be capital 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.180
 Look, Miguel, I'm just going to say one 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.670
 thing I have come here not to be captain 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.220
 much less I have come to compete 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.140
 that's number one number 2 I did not 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.090
 hanging from nobody here because to me 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.430
 michelle soifer did not help me 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.790
 win the season last season 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.129
 to the ring and I was the one who won the first 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.410
 game and I was the one who proved what 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.989
 we are made cobras and another little thing 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.790
 I want to tell you, I hope you stay 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.470
 this season because as well as the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 win the lions of the feed I win 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.300
 towards this season 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.100
 thinking not winning 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.100
 and one more thing this 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.120
 or peter jupiter good what to me 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.840
 opinion yes yes 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.340
 the cup requires concentration 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.400
 it requires knowing the game and that too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 it requires thinking anyway and you do not 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.790
 worry level that if you want 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.380
 competition competition you will have but 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.540
 this season we won the cobras and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 I challenge you to compete in everything that 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 remains of the program 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.250
 the truth 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.550
 do not tell me not the subject the media theme 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.080
 I do not care about the truth of any 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.080
 way in some percentage 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.210
 your romance commission are cert 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.909
 I believe that if I'm not saying that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.519
 I searched for it 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.519
 I'm saying that somehow 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.560
 to make you a little more known of 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.110
 all ways anyway 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.690
 and to stay here and stay here 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.220
 romances work people like it 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.520
 mitchell 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 in fact he felt something for you 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.840
 and I really ask and be honest about 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.569
 please that something in something was useful for you 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.489
 well I could answer and I do not have it 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.819
 clear but what do you think you have to 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.940
 say this is a competition program 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.890
 not of romances that at some point 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 something then there was left and things are 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.760
 more than clear I have come here to 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.610
 compete there if there is a pass I tell you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.330

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.970

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.190

 proud you take the challenge I have come 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.390
 here to compete more not to another type of 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.640
 Perfect cut that is asked 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.060
 the goal was to ask me it seems 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.880
 that somehow 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.420
 served 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.420
 Tell us 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.320
 yes or no if it had been the same with 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.490
 mechel or without a ticket 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.950
 it would have been the same 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.110
 I'll tell you again and I'll go 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.670
 I am and I do not do this and I have come to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.100
 compete I have not come to put together any 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.410
 type of romance without you think of 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.510
 that thanks to michelle I did it myself 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.690
