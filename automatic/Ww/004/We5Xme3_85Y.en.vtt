crack at it
the<00:02:01.650> next<00:02:01.950> couple<00:02:02.160> questions<00:02:02.460> revolve<00:02:03.450> around

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the next couple questions revolve around

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.740 
the next couple questions revolve around
setup<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> sizing<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.880> first<00:02:06.150> thing<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.510> note

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
setup and sizing the first thing to note

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320 
setup and sizing the first thing to note
is<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.020> refugium<00:02:07.980> z'<00:02:08.040> are<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.550> essential

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is that refugium z' are not essential

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
is that refugium z' are not essential
like<00:02:09.570> other<00:02:09.810> pieces<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> equipment<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:11.030> huge

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
systems the flora and fauna outpaced the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300 
systems the flora and fauna outpaced the
consumption<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> fish<00:02:16.040> having<00:02:17.040> said<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
consumption of the fish having said that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
consumption of the fish having said that
not<00:02:18.030> everyone<00:02:18.660> has<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.050> space<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.710> giant

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
not everyone has the space for giant

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.950 
not everyone has the space for giant
systems<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.760> only<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> couple<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.510> fish<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.870> it

systems with only a couple of fish in it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.410 
systems with only a couple of fish in it
and<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.950> why<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> refugium<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> great

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and this is why a refugium is a great

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.260 
and this is why a refugium is a great
option<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.020> first<00:02:25.260> place<00:02:25.500> how<00:02:26.340> small<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
option in the first place how small a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.300 
option in the first place how small a
refugium<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.740> still<00:02:29.100> be

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
refugium you can have and still be

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.250 
refugium you can have and still be
effective<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> tough<00:02:30.570> question

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
effective is a tough question

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
effective is a tough question
my<00:02:31.890> recommendation<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.760> always<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.420> install

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
my recommendation is always to install

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.680 
my recommendation is always to install
the<00:02:33.840> largest<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.770> reasonably<00:02:35.190> fit

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
the largest one you can reasonably fit

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.090 
the largest one you can reasonably fit
having<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.750> small<00:02:37.020> refugium<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.709> better<00:02:37.890> than

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
having a small refugium is better than

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.820 
having a small refugium is better than
having<00:02:38.250> no<00:02:38.550> refugium<00:02:39.060> at<00:02:39.240> all<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.110> said<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
having no refugium at all that said the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.550 
having no refugium at all that said the
benefits<00:02:41.220> scale<00:02:41.880> with<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> size<00:02:42.630> there's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
benefits scale with the size there's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.110 
benefits scale with the size there's
nothing<00:02:43.920> wrong<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.130> having<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.760> refugium

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
nothing wrong with having a refugium

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.449 
nothing wrong with having a refugium
that's<00:02:46.050> much<00:02:46.470> bigger<00:02:46.740> than<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.100> display

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
that's much bigger than the display

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
aquarium itself as for placement in the
setup<00:02:50.760> there's<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.510> lot<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.810> discussion<00:02:52.320> about

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
setup there's a lot of discussion about

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the optimal order of things most people

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.080 
the optimal order of things most people
would<00:02:55.560> say<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> refugium<00:02:56.610> should<00:02:56.970> be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
would say that the refugium should be

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
would say that the refugium should be
fed<00:02:57.330> water<00:02:57.630> after<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.500> filtration<00:02:58.880> such<00:02:59.880> as

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
fed water after the filtration such as

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.640 
fed water after the filtration such as
the<00:03:00.150> protein<00:03:00.540> skimmer<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.320> critters

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the protein skimmer so the critters

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.650 
the protein skimmer so the critters
don't<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.070> skimmed<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.610> if<00:03:02.970> you're<00:03:03.450> really

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
don't get skimmed out if you're really

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.930 
don't get skimmed out if you're really
crazy<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.769> go<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.100> step<00:03:05.130> further<00:03:05.610> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
crazy you can go one step further and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
crazy you can go one step further and
have<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> refugium<00:03:06.720> located<00:03:07.200> above<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.800> show

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
have the refugium located above the show

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.850 
have the refugium located above the show
tank<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.760> drain<00:03:09.060> down<00:03:09.239> into<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.720> display<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
tank and drain down into the display so

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.009 
tank and drain down into the display so
as<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.280> avoid<00:03:11.550> anything<00:03:12.060> getting<00:03:12.480> killed<00:03:12.750> by<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
return pump in my opinion it doesn't

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.240

the pumps themselves the only thing that
I<00:03:21.720> would<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.049> try<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.500> avoid<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.220> exposing

I would really try to avoid is exposing

the microphone to a UV sterilizer so if
