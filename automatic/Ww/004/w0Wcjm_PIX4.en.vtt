shaking<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:15.289> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.590> happened

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
shaking like this is what happened

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
shaking like this is what happened
to<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.070> buddy<00:00:17.310> Fodor<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.880> his<00:00:18.029> Jeep<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> we

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to my buddy Fodor with his Jeep and we

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
to my buddy Fodor with his Jeep and we
troubleshot<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.949> finally<00:00:20.279> came<00:00:20.460> down

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
troubleshot it and it finally came down

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.849 
troubleshot it and it finally came down
to<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> broken<00:00:21.630> spring<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> head<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.680> watch

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to a broken spring in the head so watch

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
to a broken spring in the head so watch
the<00:00:23.039> video<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.609> how<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.000> troubleshoot<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the video and see how we troubleshoot it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.099 
the video and see how we troubleshoot it
so<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.529> got<00:00:25.710> four<00:00:25.949> doors<00:00:26.130> Jeep<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
so we got four doors Jeep here and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
so we got four doors Jeep here and
running<00:00:28.109> rough<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.490> tell<00:00:29.699> right

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
running rough but you can tell right

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.580 
running rough but you can tell right
here<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.210> gotta<00:00:30.390> back<00:00:30.570> engage<00:00:30.929> hooked<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
here we gotta back engage hooked up and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.729 
here we gotta back engage hooked up and
Neal's<00:00:31.859> jumping<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.759> could<00:00:33.140> indicate<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
Neal's jumping so it could indicate a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.220 
Neal's jumping so it could indicate a
worn<00:00:35.130> or<00:00:35.520> broken<00:00:35.550> valve<00:00:36.120> spring<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.840> could

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
worn or broken valve spring our could

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
worn or broken valve spring our could
indicate<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.190> head<00:00:38.370> gaskets<00:00:38.879> blowing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
indicate that the head gaskets blowing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.170 
indicate that the head gaskets blowing
he<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> having<00:00:40.559> issues<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.010> overheating<00:00:41.820> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
he is having issues with overheating so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840 
he is having issues with overheating so
head<00:00:42.480> gasket<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.290> well<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.649> shot<00:00:43.890> -<00:00:44.160> that's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
head gasket very well be shot - that's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
head gasket very well be shot - that's
something<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> look<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.350> now<00:00:46.800> we're

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
something you have to look at now we're

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
something you have to look at now we're
gonna<00:00:47.039> smoke<00:00:47.430> test<00:00:47.760> Fedor's<00:00:48.120> engine<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.960> if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
gonna smoke test Fedor's engine see if

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.590 
gonna smoke test Fedor's engine see if
there<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.530> intake<00:00:49.829> leak<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.250> something

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.319 

pretty<00:00:59.600> one<00:00:59.809> yeah<00:01:00.790> let's<00:01:01.790> see<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:01.940> smoke

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
pretty one yeah let's see that smoke

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.359 
pretty one yeah let's see that smoke
come<00:01:02.570> out<00:01:02.690> can<00:01:03.590> you<00:01:03.620> pull<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:03.949> off

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
come out can you pull it off

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.700 
come out can you pull it off
oh<00:01:04.479> we<00:01:05.479> just<00:01:05.510> smoked<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.020> engine<00:01:06.350> not<00:01:06.470> seeing

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
oh we just smoked the engine not seeing

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:16.270 
oh we just smoked the engine not seeing
any<00:01:06.830> smoke<00:01:07.159> come<00:01:07.369> out<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.440> that's<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.950> good<00:01:16.040> sign

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
any smoke come out so that's a good sign

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.330 
any smoke come out so that's a good sign
there's<00:01:16.490> no<00:01:16.700> intake<00:01:17.540> leaks<00:01:18.040> however<00:01:19.040> that's<00:01:19.220> a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
there's no intake leaks however that's a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.630 
there's no intake leaks however that's a
bad<00:01:19.520> sign<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.909> means<00:01:20.240> could<00:01:20.869> be<00:01:21.640> broken

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
bad sign that means could be broken

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.120 
bad sign that means could be broken

engine running we're 21 pounds of
pressure<00:01:27.530> seems<00:01:27.920> kind<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.220> low<00:01:33.610> really<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> 30

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090

pressure seems kind of low really a 30
pounds<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.660> pressure

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.160 

all<00:01:45.370> right<00:01:45.640> we<00:01:45.970> found<00:01:46.210> what<00:01:46.360> cylinders<00:01:46.869> it's<00:01:47.049> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
all right we found what cylinders it's a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.690 
all right we found what cylinders it's a
little<00:01:47.530> on<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.650> rough<00:01:47.920> side<00:01:48.190> we're<00:01:48.460> gonna<00:01:48.580> do

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
little on the rough side we're gonna do

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.670 
little on the rough side we're gonna do
a<00:01:48.729> compression<00:01:49.090> test<00:01:49.270> on<00:01:49.659> this<00:01:49.780> one<00:01:50.020> hole<00:01:50.320> so

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
a compression test on this one hole so

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.070 
a compression test on this one hole so
far<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.190> see<00:01:51.340> what<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> compression<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.090> fuel

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
far to see what the compression is fuel

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.680 
far to see what the compression is fuel
pump<00:01:53.320> relays<00:01:53.710> pulled<00:01:54.040> out

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
pump relays pulled out

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:05.130 
pump relays pulled out
might<00:01:55.690> sputter<00:01:56.200> for<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> second<00:01:57.009> but<00:02:03.869> no<00:02:04.869> matter

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
might sputter for a second but no matter

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.279 
might sputter for a second but no matter
who's<00:02:05.950> good<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:07.630> compressions<00:02:08.170> we

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
who's good your compressions we

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.719 
who's good your compressions we
heard<00:02:08.500> my<00:02:08.709> engine<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.190> almost<00:02:09.340> hitting<00:02:09.610> like

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
heard my engine you almost hitting like

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:19.850 
heard my engine you almost hitting like
150<00:02:10.330> take<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.380> over

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.550 

okay<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:22.090> cylinder<00:02:22.450> number<00:02:22.720> six<00:02:23.050> has<00:02:23.290> no

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
okay so cylinder number six has no

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
okay so cylinder number six has no
compression<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.370> use<00:02:24.519> my<00:02:24.550> borescope

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
compression I just use my borescope

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.370 
compression I just use my borescope
there's<00:02:25.420> no<00:02:25.570> sense<00:02:25.810> putting<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
there's no sense putting that in the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.750 
there's no sense putting that in the
camera<00:02:26.709> he's<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.130> see<00:02:27.550> all

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
camera he's not going to see all

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.150 
camera he's not going to see all
piston<00:02:28.690> looks<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.320> not<00:02:29.500> shattered<00:02:30.040> or

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
piston looks like it's not shattered or

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.320 
piston looks like it's not shattered or
anything<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.820> we<00:02:31.600> could<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:33.209> broken<00:02:34.209> valve

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
anything so we could have a broken valve

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.970 
anything so we could have a broken valve
spring<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.810> something<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.290> there<00:02:35.530> we're<00:02:35.860> going

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
spring or something in there we're going

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.840 
spring or something in there we're going
to<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.720> remove<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> valve<00:02:38.050> cover<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
