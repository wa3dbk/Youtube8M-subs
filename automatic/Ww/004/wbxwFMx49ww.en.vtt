stare<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> mirror<00:00:10.650> you'll<00:00:11.190> turn<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:12.030> until

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
stare in a mirror you'll turn this until

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.440 
stare in a mirror you'll turn this until
it's<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.719> thin<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.299> you<00:00:15.299> can

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it's as thin as it can be and you can

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.840 
it's as thin as it can be and you can
see<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:15.990> you're<00:00:16.199> parallel<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:17.520> teachers

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
see if you're parallel some teachers

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.630 
see if you're parallel some teachers
will<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.060> students<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.750> bow<00:00:18.960> hops<00:00:19.640> keeping

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
will have students do bow hops keeping

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
it parallel in the mirror that's a good

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.929 
it parallel in the mirror that's a good
idea

another thing that really helped me
tremendously<00:00:26.840> was<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.980> stare<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:29.789> contact

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
tremendously was to stare at my contact

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.420 
tremendously was to stare at my contact
point<00:00:30.599> where<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> bow<00:00:31.650> hairs<00:00:31.949> touch<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
point where the bow hairs touch the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
point where the bow hairs touch the
string<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.600> watch<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.899> point<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.880> can

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
string if you watch that point you can

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.110 
string if you watch that point you can
be<00:00:36.180> parallel<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> bridge<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> still<00:00:38.120> slip

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
or away from the bridge okay that is a

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
or away from the bridge okay that is a
some<00:00:46.649> teachers<00:00:46.950> call<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> slip<00:00:47.640> tone<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
some teachers call it slip tone that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.200 
some teachers call it slip tone that
sound<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.950> fuzziness<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> on

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
sound that fuzziness you would do it on

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.350 
sound that fuzziness you would do it on
purpose<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:53.039> diminuendo<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.000> fade<00:00:54.210> to

purpose to diminuendo and fade to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
purpose to diminuendo and fade to
nothing<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.250> bowing

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
nothing but just because you are bowing

nothing but just because you are bowing
down<00:00:56.640> bow<00:00:57.059> does<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.449> mean<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.930> bow<00:00:58.109> should

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
down bow does not mean your bow should

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
down bow does not mean your bow should
drift<00:00:58.559> away<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.280> driving<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
drift away it's like driving on a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
drift away it's like driving on a
highway<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> drift<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:01.530> one

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
highway you don't want to drift from one

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
highway you don't want to drift from one
lane<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> another<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.850> imagine<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.420> bow<00:01:03.600> has

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
lane to another so imagine your bow has

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
lane to another so imagine your bow has
a<00:01:04.140> magnet<00:01:04.650> underneath<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> holding<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> bow

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a magnet underneath it holding the bow

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.260 
a magnet underneath it holding the bow
to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> string<00:01:06.600> firmly<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> train

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to the string firmly or you're a train

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
to the string firmly or you're a train
on<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.570> train<00:01:09.869> track<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.890> doesn't<00:01:11.250> slip

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
on a train track and it doesn't slip

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
on a train track and it doesn't slip
that<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.090> spot<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.990> eyes<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> watch

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that one spot now use your eyes to watch

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
that one spot now use your eyes to watch
the<00:01:14.130> boat<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> best<00:01:15.240> trick<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> know

towards the bridge or towards the thing
just<00:01:22.359> grab<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.960> one<00:01:23.229> spot<00:01:23.679> and<00:01:24.369> make<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.789> stay

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
keeping it absolutely still and there's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
keeping it absolutely still and there's
one<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.740> thing<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.549> interesting

and<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.740> bow<00:01:38.240> if<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.079> with

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and that is the bow if I go up but with

now with the firmness of my bow hand not
squeezing<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.539> you're

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
squeezing just that it's like you're

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.749 
squeezing just that it's like you're
holding<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.080> large<00:02:04.289> glass<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.709> water<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.610> don't

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
holding a large glass of water you don't

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.370 
holding a large glass of water you don't
have<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> squeeze<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.630> hard<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.140> it's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
have to squeeze it really hard but it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
have to squeeze it really hard but it's
firm<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.759> doesn't<00:02:09.000> slip<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> pull<00:02:09.780> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
firm so it doesn't slip now you pull in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.509 
firm so it doesn't slip now you pull in
just<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.350> tiny<00:02:10.679> bit<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.370> no<00:02:11.489> longer

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
just a tiny bit so it's no longer

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.550 
just a tiny bit so it's no longer
parallel<00:02:12.090> exactly<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.930> firmness<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
parallel exactly and the firmness in the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.500 
parallel exactly and the firmness in the
hand<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.190> angle<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.030> created

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
hand and that angle that you created

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.410 
hand and that angle that you created
will<00:02:19.260> hold<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> boat<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.640> place<00:02:20.940> then<00:02:21.299> on

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
will hold the boat in one place then on

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.820 
will hold the boat in one place then on
a<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.720> bow<00:02:21.959> you'd<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> other

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
a down bow you'd have to go the other

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.510 
a down bow you'd have to go the other
way

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
way

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.020 
way
same<00:02:24.850> idea<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:26.230> would<00:02:26.380> be<00:02:26.560> this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.449 

a<00:02:29.750> different<00:02:30.740> teacher<00:02:30.920> called<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
a different teacher called that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.840 
a different teacher called that
figure-eight<00:02:31.910> bowing<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.140> neat<00:02:33.440> idea<00:02:33.850> it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
figure-eight bowing it's a neat idea it

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.620 
figure-eight bowing it's a neat idea it
helps<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.240> feel<00:02:36.459> feel<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.700> bow<00:02:37.880> grabbing<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
helps you feel feel the bow grabbing the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.480 
helps you feel feel the bow grabbing the
string<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.080> staying<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:39.709> place<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:40.250> don't

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
string and staying in one place I don't

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.040 
string and staying in one place I don't
do<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.120> time<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.480> sometimes<00:02:41.660> if<00:02:41.930> I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
do it all the time but sometimes if I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.650 
do it all the time but sometimes if I
have<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.530> long<00:02:43.040> note<00:02:43.459> especially<00:02:44.240> an

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
have a really long note especially an

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.350 
have a really long note especially an
up-bow<00:02:45.080> i'll<00:02:45.560> pull<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.670> I'm<00:02:46.730> not<00:02:46.910> parallel

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
up-bow i'll pull in so I'm not parallel

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
up-bow i'll pull in so I'm not parallel
to<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.600> bridge<00:02:48.520> but<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.640> doesn't<00:02:50.000> slip<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:51.260> you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
to the bridge but it doesn't slip if you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.900 
to the bridge but it doesn't slip if you
do<00:02:51.530> too<00:02:51.709> much<00:02:51.860> you'll<00:02:52.100> jump<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.520> bridge<00:02:52.700> with

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
do too much you'll jump the bridge with

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.120 
do too much you'll jump the bridge with
the<00:02:52.970> boat<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.750> must<00:02:53.959> be<00:02:54.020> careful<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
the boat so you must be careful but the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.590 
the boat so you must be careful but the
first<00:02:55.400> thing<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:57.010> rock<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.489> find<00:02:59.450> it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
first thing to do is rock and find it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.160 
first thing to do is rock and find it
parallel<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.380> bridge<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:02.900> if<00:03:02.959> you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
parallel to the bridge then see if you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.979 
parallel to the bridge then see if you
stare<00:03:04.160> at<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.430> bridge<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.390> keep<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:05.959> that

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
stare at the bridge and keep it in that

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.979 
stare at the bridge and keep it in that
one<00:03:06.290> spot<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.930> doesn't<00:03:09.260> slider<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:10.989> one

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
one spot so it doesn't slider in one

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.630 
one spot so it doesn't slider in one
other<00:03:12.140> part<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.250> more

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
other part of this is it's more

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.729 
other part of this is it's more
controversial<00:03:14.269> is<00:03:14.390> whether<00:03:14.660> or<00:03:14.900> not<00:03:14.959> your<00:03:15.530> bow

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
controversial is whether or not your bow

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.630 
controversial is whether or not your bow
hair<00:03:15.980> should<00:03:16.220> remain<00:03:16.610> flat<00:03:18.069> at<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.130> tip<00:03:19.489> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
hair should remain flat at the tip and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.660 
hair should remain flat at the tip and
the<00:03:20.030> Frog<00:03:20.269> okay<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.319> old<00:03:21.500> school<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.489> way<00:03:22.640> I

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the Frog okay the old school the way I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.330 
the Frog okay the old school the way I
was<00:03:22.910> taught<00:03:23.120> as<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.300> boy<00:03:23.540> was<00:03:24.230> you're<00:03:24.769> flat<00:03:25.160> at

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
was taught as a boy was you're flat at

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.120 
was taught as a boy was you're flat at
the<00:03:25.459> tip<00:03:25.670> because<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.840> tip<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.050> lightest<00:03:27.560> its

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
the tip because the tip is lightest its

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490 
the tip because the tip is lightest its
weakest<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:29.420> want<00:03:29.630> full<00:03:29.870> contact<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.470> the

weakest so you want full contact of the
hair<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.890> go<00:03:31.700> up<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.569> when<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.350> get<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
hair you go up and when you get to the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.259 
hair you go up and when you get to the
very<00:03:33.860> Frog<00:03:34.160> you'll<00:03:34.430> roll<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.850> side<00:03:34.940> of

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
very Frog you'll roll to the side of

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.840 
very Frog you'll roll to the side of
there<00:03:35.390> okay<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:37.070> works<00:03:37.280> great<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.820> E

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
there okay it works great on the E

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.979 
there okay it works great on the E
string<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.900> don't<00:03:39.200> run<00:03:39.410> into<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.860> corners

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
string so you don't run into the corners

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.319 
string so you don't run into the corners
pull<00:03:41.989> your<00:03:42.230> hand<00:03:42.470> away<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:43.459> way<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.299> can

that<00:03:47.600> Bell<00:03:48.110> right<00:03:48.350> there<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:49.360> found<00:03:50.360> though

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
that Bell right there I found though

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.920 
that Bell right there I found though
that<00:03:50.780> when<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.200> do<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.519> have<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.390> little<00:03:53.630> more

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that when I do that I have a little more

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.810 
that when I do that I have a little more
difficulty<00:03:54.590> keeping<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.220> one<00:03:55.340> place<00:03:55.610> so

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
difficulty keeping it in one place so

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.750 
difficulty keeping it in one place so
what<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.060> do<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.959> just<00:03:57.019> raise<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.040> hands<00:03:58.700> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
what I do is just raise my hands a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.539 
what I do is just raise my hands a
little<00:03:58.940> higher<00:03:59.859> so<00:04:00.859> instead<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.100> being<00:04:01.340> down

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
little higher so instead of being down
