I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> store-bought<00:00:48.420> broth<00:00:48.870> already

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I think the store-bought broth already

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
I think the store-bought broth already
has<00:00:49.410> enough<00:00:49.680> salt<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> adjust<00:00:50.910> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
has enough salt but you can adjust that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
has enough salt but you can adjust that
to<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.570> liking<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.980> we're<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.190> gonna
