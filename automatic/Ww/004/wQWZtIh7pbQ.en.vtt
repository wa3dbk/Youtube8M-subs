 seriecito the super professional 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.810

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 being 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.380
 and suddenly it gives you the opportunity of a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.780
 program of a reality that is half 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 of half and that's when it jumps to fame 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.620

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.050
 force with all the desire of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.700
 enthusiasm to eat the world of feeling 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.670
 that I had the opportunity that I 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.740
