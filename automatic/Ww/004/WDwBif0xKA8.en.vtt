attached<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> grass<00:01:03.120> energy<00:01:03.390> onto<00:01:03.719> my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
attached that I grass energy onto my

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
attached that I grass energy onto my
Kangaskhan<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.309> fetch

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
Kangaskhan you know so I can use fetch

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
Kangaskhan you know so I can use fetch
it<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.780> i<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> draw<00:01:07.110> cards<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.600> energy

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it so i can draw cards and use an energy

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380 
it so i can draw cards and use an energy
search<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> another<00:01:11.100> grass<00:01:11.340> energy<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
search to get another grass energy and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
search to get another grass energy and
that's<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.900> much<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.290> i<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that's pretty much all i can do at the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
that's pretty much all i can do at the
moment<00:01:14.040> i<00:01:14.490> use<00:01:14.670> fetch<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.479> under<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
moment i use fetch just to go under the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
moment i use fetch just to go under the
card<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> Bulbasaur<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
card which is the Bulbasaur which is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.140 
card which is the Bulbasaur which is
pretty<00:01:17.820> nice<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> yeah<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:20.610> point<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> my

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pretty nice and yeah so the point of my

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.859 
pretty nice and yeah so the point of my
deck<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.869> main<00:01:22.530> Leah<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.509> have<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.689> full

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
deck is a main Leah I have the full

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
deck is a main Leah I have the full
evolution<00:01:25.350> chain<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.040> promo<00:01:26.790> venusaur

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
evolution chain of the promo venusaur

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
evolution chain of the promo venusaur
from<00:01:28.380> back<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.310> file<00:01:29.729> plume<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
from back then and a file plume and the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
from back then and a file plume and the
strategy<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.670> vileplume

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
strategy with this is that vileplume

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
strategy with this is that vileplume
uses<00:01:33.540> petal<00:01:33.840> dance<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.229> gets<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> confused

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
uses petal dance which gets it confused

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.179 
uses petal dance which gets it confused
by<00:01:35.610> itself<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.409> promo<00:01:37.619> venusaur<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
by itself and the promo venusaur is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
by itself and the promo venusaur is
polka<00:01:38.670> power<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> once<00:01:39.299> per<00:01:39.390> turn<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> get

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
polka power is once per turn I can get

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
polka power is once per turn I can get
rid<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.650> status<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.520> both<00:01:41.790> active<00:01:42.119> of

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
early and I pretty much just demolish

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.129 
early and I pretty much just demolish
him<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:45.510> yeah<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:47.470> huh<00:05:47.650> that's<00:05:48.280> that's<00:05:49.090> why<00:05:49.540> I

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
him and yeah so huh that's that's why I

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.020 
him and yeah so huh that's that's why I
post<00:05:50.950> this<00:05:51.250> one<00:05:51.490> because<00:05:51.639> it's<00:05:51.850> much<00:05:52.000> shorter

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
post this one because it's much shorter

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.300 
post this one because it's much shorter
it<00:05:52.450> was<00:05:52.570> really<00:05:52.930> stali<00:05:53.320> so<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.830> another

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
it was really stali so it's another

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.240 
it was really stali so it's another
reason<00:05:54.520> why<00:05:54.700> I<00:05:54.730> didn't<00:05:55.000> post<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:56.070> but<00:05:57.070> yeah

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
reason why I didn't post it but yeah

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
battles maybe if you know I figure out a

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.380 
battles maybe if you know I figure out a
way<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:43.120> like<00:06:43.450> SAP<00:06:43.870> pokes<00:06:44.350> and<00:06:45.160> 1st<00:06:45.430> gen<00:06:45.640> if

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
way to like SAP pokes and 1st gen if

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.920 
way to like SAP pokes and 1st gen if
there<00:06:46.720> is<00:06:46.840> a<00:06:46.870> way<00:06:47.200> at<00:06:47.440> all<00:06:47.500> um<00:06:47.890> but<00:06:48.610> yeah<00:06:49.000> so<00:06:49.690> um

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
there is a way at all um but yeah so um

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.779 
there is a way at all um but yeah so um
yeah<00:06:50.470> I'll<00:06:50.590> probably<00:06:50.710> do<00:06:51.039> that<00:06:51.220> I<00:06:51.280> might<00:06:51.760> even

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
yeah I'll probably do that I might even

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.490 
yeah I'll probably do that I might even
put<00:06:52.240> in<00:06:52.360> a<00:06:52.419> description<00:06:52.510> how<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.020> do<00:06:53.289> this

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
put in a description how to do this

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.450 
put in a description how to do this
because<00:06:53.710> you<00:06:53.919> have<00:06:53.950> to<00:06:54.160> use<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.340> different

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
because you have to use a different

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.670 
because you have to use a different
emulator<00:06:55.270> it's<00:06:55.450> really<00:06:55.690> kind<00:06:56.169> of<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.320> little

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
emulator it's really kind of a little

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.400 
emulator it's really kind of a little
bit<00:06:56.800> complicated<00:06:57.100> not<00:06:57.490> really<00:06:58.169> but<00:06:59.169> you<00:06:59.380> know
