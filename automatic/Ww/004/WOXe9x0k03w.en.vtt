the movement in the past the unit tells
movements<00:02:30.260> were<00:02:31.160> actually<00:02:33.190> used<00:02:34.190> for<00:02:34.489> pocket

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
movements were actually used for pocket

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.509 
movements were actually used for pocket
watches<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:36.260> they<00:02:36.440> managed<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:37.160> them<00:02:37.370> in

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
watches but they managed to get them in

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.600 
watches but they managed to get them in
to<00:02:37.970> wrist<00:02:38.239> watches<00:02:38.480> as<00:02:38.750> well<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.579> a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
to wrist watches as well and it's not a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.990 
to wrist watches as well and it's not a
fancy<00:02:40.910> movement<00:02:41.480> as<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.690> can<00:02:41.840> see<00:02:42.019> but<00:02:43.000> it's

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
fancy movement as you can see but it's

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.539 
fancy movement as you can see but it's
very<00:02:44.239> reliable<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:46.160> called<00:02:46.459> a

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
very reliable and it's called a

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.839 
very reliable and it's called a
workhorse<00:02:47.140> movement<00:02:48.140> amongst<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
workhorse movement amongst the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.050 
workhorse movement amongst the
mechanical<00:02:49.849> ones<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:51.609> this<00:02:52.609> one<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:52.910> very

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
mechanical ones and this one is very

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240 
mechanical ones and this one is very
nice<00:02:53.390> makes<00:02:54.109> you<00:02:54.230> bond<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.069> watch

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
nice makes you bond with the watch

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.430 
nice makes you bond with the watch
because<00:02:55.519> each<00:02:55.849> morning<00:02:56.299> when<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.170> out<00:02:57.319> of
