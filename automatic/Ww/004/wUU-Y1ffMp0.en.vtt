minimal contact and it's it just seems

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
minimal contact and it's it just seems
to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.820> whether<00:01:50.970> it's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to be the way I don't know whether it's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.510

responsible is that the game is becoming

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.510 
responsible is that the game is becoming
ugly<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:58.199> that<00:05:58.380> was<00:05:58.500> an<00:05:58.620> ugly<00:05:58.740> Spectre<00:05:59.159> it
