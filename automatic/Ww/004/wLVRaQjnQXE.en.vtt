00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
fourth code and with one mover code to

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.750 
fourth code and with one mover code to
go<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:22.360> right<00:03:22.570> we<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.870> 33<00:03:23.320> people<00:03:23.680> give<00:03:24.430> one

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
in 33 shot of winning the last code okay

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.120 
in 33 shot of winning the last code okay
let's<00:03:28.420> see<00:03:28.660> final<00:03:29.380> number<00:03:29.680> what<00:03:29.830> do<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:29.980> got

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
let's see final number what do we got

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.870 
let's see final number what do we got
here<00:03:30.160> generates<00:03:32.760> number<00:03:33.760> four<00:03:34.150> okay<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:36.489> two

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
here generates number four okay one two
