00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.959 

it's<00:02:26.500> not<00:02:26.650> exactly<00:02:27.129> round<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.819> lot

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
it's not exactly round but it's a lot

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.199 
it's not exactly round but it's a lot
better<00:02:28.180> than<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.629> first<00:02:28.780> ones<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.140> made

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.890 

alright<00:02:34.209> that's<00:02:34.329> pretty<00:02:34.450> good

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
alright that's pretty good

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.660 
alright that's pretty good
it's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.859> 12<00:02:36.129> ounce<00:02:36.519> dough<00:02:37.090> ball<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:38.579> eleven<00:02:39.579> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
it's a 12 ounce dough ball so eleven and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.949 
it's a 12 ounce dough ball so eleven and
a<00:02:39.730> half<00:02:39.760> ounces<00:02:40.420> something<00:02:40.719> like<00:02:40.810> that

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
a half ounces something like that

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.420 
a half ounces something like that
depends<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.650> which<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:41.980> know<00:02:42.069> which<00:02:42.189> one<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
depends on which you know which one it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.949 
depends on which you know which one it
was<00:02:42.549> because<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.790> made<00:02:42.959> 24<00:02:43.959> today<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:45.489> it's

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
was because I made 24 today so it's

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:57.070 
was because I made 24 today so it's
about<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.019> 12<00:02:47.349> inch<00:02:47.530> pizza<00:02:47.709> right

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.280 

so<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:57.800> on<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.040> wood<00:02:58.190> peel<00:02:58.990> first<00:02:59.990> thing

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
so it's on the wood peel first thing

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.260 
so it's on the wood peel first thing
always<00:03:00.890> make<00:03:01.070> sure<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.520> not<00:03:01.700> stuck<00:03:02.030> right

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
always make sure it's not stuck right

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.500 
always make sure it's not stuck right
it's<00:03:03.080> really<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:04.190> low<00:03:04.370> hydration<00:03:05.030> caused<00:03:05.330> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
it's really the low hydration caused it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.200 
it's really the low hydration caused it
to<00:03:05.630> stick<00:03:05.840> less<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.830> last<00:03:07.070> batch<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.550> made<00:03:07.760> was

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
to stick less the last batch I made was

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.250 
to stick less the last batch I made was
really<00:03:08.240> sticky<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.490> wish<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.640> had<00:03:10.730> video<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.960> to

really sticky I wish I had video that to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.090 
really sticky I wish I had video that to
show<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.590> contrast<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.400> don't<00:03:14.890> alright<00:03:15.890> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:46.250 
oh this is supposed to be for somebody I
don't<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:36.550> what<00:03:36.640> they<00:03:36.730> want<00:03:36.850> on<00:03:37.000> it
