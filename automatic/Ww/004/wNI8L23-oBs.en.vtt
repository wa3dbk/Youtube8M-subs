heroes<00:02:01.190> are<00:02:01.400> better<00:02:02.210> than<00:02:02.390> we<00:02:02.480> expected

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
heroes are better than we expected

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.970 
heroes are better than we expected
like<00:02:04.070> Rasta<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.670> stuff<00:02:04.960> but<00:02:05.960> didn't<00:02:06.890> really

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
like Rasta and stuff but didn't really

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.900 
like Rasta and stuff but didn't really
change<00:02:07.280> much<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:09.550> played<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> little

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
change much just that we played a little

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
change much just that we played a little
bit<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.570> gotta<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.170> maybe<00:02:13.040> better

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
bit and we just gotta like maybe better

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.850 
bit and we just gotta like maybe better
shape<00:02:13.960> 5%<00:02:14.960> better<00:02:15.110> shape<00:02:15.380> or<00:02:15.560> something<00:02:15.770> like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
shape 5% better shape or something like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.210 
shape 5% better shape or something like
that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.210 
that
so<00:02:17.210> game<00:02:17.600> one<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> got<00:02:18.020> crushed<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.650> it's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so game one you got crushed but it's

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.770 
so game one you got crushed but it's
been<00:02:19.460> said<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.030> was<00:02:20.120> due<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.390> drafting

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
been said that it was due to drafting

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.930 
been said that it was due to drafting
mistakes<00:02:21.140> yeah<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.980> after<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> guys<00:02:22.580> want

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
mistakes yeah but after you guys want

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.060 
mistakes yeah but after you guys want
game<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.420> convincingly<00:02:23.990> did<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.860> guys<00:02:25.010> think

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
game to convincingly did you guys think

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.810 
game to convincingly did you guys think
game<00:02:25.730> 3<00:02:26.030> was<00:02:26.180> yours<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.900> sure<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:28.040> had<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
game 3 was yours for sure we had a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.120 
game 3 was yours for sure we had a
feeling<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.840> game<00:02:30.140> being<00:02:30.710> awesome

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
feeling of game being awesome

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.199 
feeling of game being awesome
just<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.700> they<00:02:31.820> don't<00:02:32.000> want<00:02:32.150> to

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
just because that they don't want to

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.210 
just because that they don't want to
pick<00:02:32.360> Nagas<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.230> we're<00:02:33.980> already

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
pick Nagas like we have we're already

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.890 
pick Nagas like we have we're already
thinking<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.820> they're<00:02:35.000> they're<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> mess

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
thinking like they're they're in a mess

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.420 
thinking like they're they're in a mess
if<00:02:36.110> they<00:02:36.200> don't<00:02:36.380> pick<00:02:36.560> magnet<00:02:36.890> right<00:02:36.950> now<00:02:37.160> I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
if they don't pick magnet right now I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
if they don't pick magnet right now I
mean<00:02:37.670> there's<00:02:38.390> their<00:02:38.780> picks<00:02:38.990> were<00:02:39.140> fine<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
mean there's their picks were fine I

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.980 
mean there's their picks were fine I
think<00:02:40.160> just<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:41.150> bit<00:02:41.300> out<00:02:41.420> drafted<00:02:41.840> some

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
think just a little bit out drafted some

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.810 
think just a little bit out drafted some
clutch<00:02:42.200> feels<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.709> enigma<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.190> Rubik<00:02:43.550> like

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
clutch feels like enigma and Rubik like

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.150 
clutch feels like enigma and Rubik like
they<00:02:43.940> weren't<00:02:44.270> expecting<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.709> still

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
they weren't expecting that but still

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.260 
they weren't expecting that but still
their<00:02:46.400> pick<00:02:46.610> was<00:02:46.760> fine

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
their pick was fine

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.310 
their pick was fine
I<00:02:47.300> guess<00:02:47.510> they<00:02:47.660> could've<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.020> picked

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
I guess they could've like picked

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.310 
I guess they could've like picked
something<00:02:48.530> else<00:02:48.800> instead<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.160> puck<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.320> maybe

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
something else instead of puck and maybe

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.230 
something else instead of puck and maybe
some<00:02:51.560> tidehunter<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.459> don't<00:02:52.970> think<00:02:53.150> they

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
some tidehunter I don't think they

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.430 
some tidehunter I don't think they
needed<00:02:53.540> tidehunter<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:55.450> really<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:57.080> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
needed tidehunter but really like I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.580 
needed tidehunter but really like I
don't<00:02:58.100> know<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.550> felt<00:02:59.300> in<00:02:59.570> the<00:03:00.080> third<00:03:00.290> game<00:03:00.560> that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
don't know I felt in the third game that

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.400 
don't know I felt in the third game that
we<00:03:00.890> had<00:03:01.040> them<00:03:01.280> completely<00:03:01.640> out<00:03:01.760> picked<00:03:02.410> were

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
we had them completely out picked were

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.320 
we had them completely out picked were

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
gonna change in your strategy against

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.900 
gonna change in your strategy against
them

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
them

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.260 
them
I<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:24.810> our<00:03:25.260> strategy<00:03:25.610> will<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:27.090> won't

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
I don't think our strategy will it won't

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.190 
I don't think our strategy will it won't
change<00:03:28.640> we<00:03:29.640> might<00:03:29.820> be<00:03:30.330> able<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.930> pick

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
change we might be able to like pick

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.260 
change we might be able to like pick
some<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> strategies<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.130> we<00:03:32.340> use<00:03:32.460> it's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
some of the strategies that we use it's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.030 
some of the strategies that we use it's
not<00:03:33.690> been<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.050> available<00:03:34.620> like<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
not been like available like the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.830 
not been like available like the
juggernaut<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.240> of<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.450> things<00:03:36.660> that

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
juggernaut it's one of the things that

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.050 
juggernaut it's one of the things that
we<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.080> might<00:03:37.560> use<00:03:37.860> it's<00:03:38.610> not<00:03:38.670> really<00:03:38.940> that

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
we can might use it's not really that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.510 
we can might use it's not really that
good<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.990> idea<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:41.010> simple

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
good but the idea of it is just simple

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.980 
good but the idea of it is just simple
we<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.150> play<00:03:42.450> simply<00:03:44.150> LGD<00:03:45.150> lgd's<00:03:45.690> such<00:03:45.960> a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
we can play simply LGD lgd's such a

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.410 
we can play simply LGD lgd's such a
tough<00:03:46.290> opponent<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.610> have<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.790> feeling<00:03:48.210> that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
tough opponent and I have a feeling that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.900
