00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
lot of attention span or something but

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.620 
lot of attention span or something but
really<00:05:39.340> they<00:05:39.490> wrap<00:05:39.729> it's<00:05:40.000> not<00:05:40.150> like<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.510> was

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630

wearing<00:05:41.110> on<00:05:41.229> me<00:05:41.410> it<00:05:41.590> wrapped<00:05:41.800> up<00:05:41.950> just<00:05:42.160> in<00:05:42.340> time

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
wearing on me it wrapped up just in time

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.540 
wearing on me it wrapped up just in time
this<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.270> good<00:05:43.600> like<00:05:44.140> finale<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.250> and

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
