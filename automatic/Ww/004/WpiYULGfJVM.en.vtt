00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.060 

so<00:00:09.660> we've<00:00:09.840> talked<00:00:10.080> before<00:00:10.230> about<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.800> number

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so we've talked before about the number

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.530 
so we've talked before about the number
of<00:00:11.190> game<00:00:11.429> engines<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> be

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
of game engines that are going to be

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.410 
of game engines that are going to be
implementing<00:00:13.139> dx12<00:00:13.889> into<00:00:14.670> their<00:00:14.880> systems

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
implementing dx12 into their systems

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.599 
implementing dx12 into their systems
that<00:00:16.170> means<00:00:16.350> games<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.980> are<00:00:17.070> built<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.460> these

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
that means games that are built on these

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.429 
that means games that are built on these
systems<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.600> taking<00:00:18.990> advantage

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
systems are going to be taking advantage

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.960 
systems are going to be taking advantage
of<00:00:19.560> dx12<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> they<00:00:20.340> don't<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
of dx12 and they don't have to do a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
of dx12 and they don't have to do a
whole<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.420> work<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.960> order<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.619> make<00:00:22.769> it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
whole lot of work in order to make it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
whole lot of work in order to make it
happen<00:00:23.039> you've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.490> engines<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.029> unreal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
happen you've got engines like unreal

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.560 
happen you've got engines like unreal
and<00:00:24.960> Crytek<00:00:25.500> unity<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> several<00:00:26.970> others<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and Crytek unity and several others and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
and Crytek unity and several others and
another<00:00:28.140> engine<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.160> taking

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
another engine that's going to be taking

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060 
another engine that's going to be taking
advantage<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.619> haven't<00:00:31.920> talked

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
advantage of this that we haven't talked

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.790 
advantage of this that we haven't talked
that<00:00:32.189> much<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.910> EA's<00:00:33.750> frostbite<00:00:34.500> engine

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that much about is EA's frostbite engine

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.520 
that much about is EA's frostbite engine
so<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.820> implementing<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
so they're going to be implementing it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
so they're going to be implementing it

people to upgrade but still you're
looking<00:01:32.100> at<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.490> many<00:01:32.610> systems<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.240> there

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
looking at so many systems out there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that may not upgrade I mean you're

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
that may not upgrade I mean you're
throwing<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.680> just

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
throwing it out there that you're just

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going to cut off these people and you're

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
going to cut off these people and you're
going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> maybe<00:01:40.140> possibly<00:01:40.770> miss<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.369> sales

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
going to maybe possibly miss these sales

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480

director he claims that this is an

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
director he claims that this is an
aggressive<00:01:47.579> step<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.869> he<00:01:48.930> also<00:01:49.140> says<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
aggressive step but he also says it's a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
aggressive step but he also says it's a
step<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.610> comes<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.299> major<00:01:51.600> benefits<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
step that comes with major benefits and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.270 
step that comes with major benefits and
that<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.720> too<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:56.130> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that it's just really too good to not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
that it's just really too good to not
take<00:01:56.490> advantage<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.869> to

12<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.389> going<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.750> help<00:03:51.959> with<00:03:52.169> things<00:03:52.349> like

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
12 is going to help with things like

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.289 
12 is going to help with things like
physics<00:03:53.069> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.489> help<00:03:53.669> with<00:03:53.849> things<00:03:54.000> like

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
physics going to help with things like

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.039 
physics going to help with things like
destruction<00:03:55.139> in<00:03:55.500> games<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.849> hope<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.810> this

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
destruction in games so I hope that this

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.280 
destruction in games so I hope that this
gets<00:03:58.709> back<00:03:59.189> to<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.609> level<00:03:59.849> of<00:04:00.150> where<00:04:00.629> I<00:04:00.870> I

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
gets back to the level of where I I

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.439 
gets back to the level of where I I
thought<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.859> was<00:04:02.069> going<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.340> be<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:03.299> know

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
thought this was going to be you know

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.929 
thought this was going to be you know
years<00:04:03.930> ago<00:04:04.259> whenever<00:04:05.189> they<00:04:05.340> had<00:04:05.519> implemented

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
years ago whenever they had implemented

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.559 
years ago whenever they had implemented
this<00:04:06.209> type<00:04:06.449> thing<00:04:06.719> and<00:04:06.979> so<00:04:07.979> anyway<00:04:08.569> that's

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
this type thing and so anyway that's

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.110 
this type thing and so anyway that's
what<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:09.989> would<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:10.739> for<00:04:10.769> dx12<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.669> do<00:04:11.819> if<00:04:12.000> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
what I would like for dx12 to do if it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.390 
what I would like for dx12 to do if it
does<00:04:12.329> anything<00:04:12.659> for<00:04:13.560> my<00:04:13.680> Battlefield<00:04:14.159> games

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400

Windows 10 and dx12 but they

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.150

is the lead technical director for
frostbite<00:04:29.520> which<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.570> would<00:04:30.720> imagine<00:04:30.990> has<00:04:31.410> some

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
frostbite which I would imagine has some

frostbite which I would imagine has some
pool<00:04:32.070> now<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:32.940> ultimately<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.720> decision<00:04:34.289> is

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
pool now but ultimately the decision is

enough<00:04:44.699> people<00:04:44.729> are<00:04:45.240> going<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.539> take

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
enough people are going to take

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.629 
enough people are going to take
advantage<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.229> upgrading<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.800> Windows<00:04:47.190> 10<00:04:47.430> for

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
advantage of upgrading to Windows 10 for

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
and 8 might become irrelevant to game

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.060
