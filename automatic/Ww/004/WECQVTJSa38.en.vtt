in a recession what have you done with

your price points you know it's and
that's<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.120> question<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.860> every

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that's a question we get really is every

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.030 
that's a question we get really is every
new<00:02:41.220> client<00:02:41.400> calls<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.410> price<00:02:43.710> per<00:02:43.920> hour

we've<00:02:44.490> we've<00:02:44.850> dropped<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.560> right

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
we've we've dropped you know it's right

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.790 
we've we've dropped you know it's right
around<00:02:47.090> $20<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.330> we've<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.750> drop<00:02:49.410> below<00:02:49.620> that

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
around $20 and we've we drop below that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.370 
around $20 and we've we drop below that
so<00:02:50.190> we're<00:02:50.340> below<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.820> market<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.960> second

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so we're below the market but the second

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.620 
so we're below the market but the second
part<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.830> question<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.850> what<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
part of that question is is what is the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.080 
part of that question is is what is the
minimum<00:02:54.810> hours<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.590> service<00:02:56.010> most<00:02:56.640> agencies

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
minimum hours of service most agencies

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.410 
minimum hours of service most agencies
or<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> industry<00:02:57.810> norm<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.440> four<00:02:58.740> hours<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
or the industry norm is four hours so a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.830 
or the industry norm is four hours so a
family<00:03:00.660> would<00:03:00.990> be<00:03:01.020> spending<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.830> minimum<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
family would be spending a minimum of

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280 
family would be spending a minimum of
$80<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.170> each<00:03:04.350> service<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.960> decided<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.080> cut

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
$80 for each service we decided to cut

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.040 
$80 for each service we decided to cut
that<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> way<00:03:07.890> down<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.220> two<00:03:08.430> hours<00:03:09.050> so

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that all the way down to two hours so

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.500 
that all the way down to two hours so
hence<00:03:10.650> they<00:03:10.950> would<00:03:11.370> only<00:03:11.460> be<00:03:11.700> paying<00:03:11.910> $40

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
hence they would only be paying $40

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.110 
hence they would only be paying $40
they're<00:03:12.660> saving<00:03:12.900> 50%<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.520> lot<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> cases
