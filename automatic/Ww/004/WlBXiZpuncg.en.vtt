00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.340 

it's<00:00:02.700> very<00:00:02.909> simple<00:00:03.360> all<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.689> have<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:04.049> is

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
it's very simple all you have to do is

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.400 
it's very simple all you have to do is
cut<00:00:04.859> off<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> end<00:00:05.810> cable<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.960> have<00:00:07.140> laying

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
cut off the end cable you have laying

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.640 
cut off the end cable you have laying
around<00:00:07.560> your<00:00:07.830> house<00:00:10.730> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.940> cut<00:00:12.690> once<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
around your house you can cut once you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.230 
around your house you can cut once you
cut<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.889> end<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.490> strip<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.759> two<00:00:15.030> wires

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
cut the end you just strip the two wires

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.040 
cut the end you just strip the two wires
there's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:16.460> center<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.760> ground<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.869> can

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
there's a center and a ground you can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.340 
there's a center and a ground you can
see<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.939> shielded<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.539> center<00:00:22.199> one

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
see the shielded one is the center one

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.740 
see the shielded one is the center one
and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.740> other<00:00:23.640> one's<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> ground<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.480> plug

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and the other one's the ground you plug

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.070 
and the other one's the ground you plug
it<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.609> there's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> schematic

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
it in like this there's a schematic

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.040 
it in like this there's a schematic
below<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.250> comments<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.789> can

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
below you can in the comments you can

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
below you can in the comments you can
look<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:31.949> resistors<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> need

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
look at it two resistors is all you need

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.060 
look at it two resistors is all you need
and<00:00:33.270> then<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> jumper<00:00:34.020> wire

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
and then you have the jumper wire

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.600 
and then you have the jumper wire
there's<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.850> outputs<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> Arduino

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
there's two outputs from the Arduino

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
there's two outputs from the Arduino
with<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.760> resistors<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> ground<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.050> just

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
with two resistors on the ground is just

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.700 
with two resistors on the ground is just
straight<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.680> ground<00:00:41.809> pretty<00:00:42.809> simple<00:00:43.260> make

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
straight to ground pretty simple make

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.049 
straight to ground pretty simple make
sure<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> twist<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.430> end<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> can

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
sure you twist the end so that you can

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.779 
sure you twist the end so that you can
slide<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.450> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> breadboard<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
slide them into the breadboard like that

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
slide them into the breadboard like that
now<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:47.969> show<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.649> plug<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> into

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
now I'll show you how to plug it into

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
now I'll show you how to plug it into
the<00:00:50.190> Arduino<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:50.910> three<00:00:51.239> wires<00:00:51.590> like<00:00:52.590> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the Arduino it's only three wires like I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
the Arduino it's only three wires like I
said<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> center<00:00:53.640> pin<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
said two for the center pin one for the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.400 
said two for the center pin one for the
ground<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.670> pin<00:01:00.660> seven<00:01:01.170> nine<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
ground so you use pin seven nine and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.329 
ground so you use pin seven nine and
ground<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.300> Arduino<00:01:03.809> those<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> set

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
ground on the Arduino those are the set

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.090 
ground on the Arduino those are the set
one<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> TV<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.270> library<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
one for the TV out library so it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
one for the TV out library so it's
easiest<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> stick<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.150> those<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.720> can

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
easiest if you stick with those you can

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.330 
easiest if you stick with those you can
modify<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.320> later<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> library<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
modify it later in the library if you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.130 
modify it later in the library if you
want<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.040> sample<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.700> do

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
want this is a sample of what you can do

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
want this is a sample of what you can do
it's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.409> base<00:01:17.159> sketch<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's a base sketch you can use just the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's a base sketch you can use just the
examples<00:01:19.680> catch<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:20.100> I'll<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.580> can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
examples catch me I'll do this you can

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
examples catch me I'll do this you can
edit<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.090> later<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:23.070> pretty

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
edit it later if you want it's pretty

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.200 
edit it later if you want it's pretty
simple<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.330> sketch<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.880> small

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
simple that they sketch you do small

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.210 
simple that they sketch you do small
bitmap<00:01:27.659> images<00:01:28.790> text<00:01:29.790> clearing<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> text

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
bitmap images text clearing the text

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
bitmap images text clearing the text
clears<00:01:32.220> pretty<00:01:32.520> fast<00:01:32.869> doesn't<00:01:33.869> flicker<00:01:34.259> or

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
clears pretty fast doesn't flicker or

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:47.860 
clears pretty fast doesn't flicker or
anything<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.460> nice

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.960 

this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> pretty<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.280> is<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:49.610> turned<00:01:49.880> me

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
this is a pretty this is what turned me

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.090 
this is a pretty this is what turned me
on<00:01:50.120> to<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.450> TV<00:01:51.080> out<00:01:51.320> thing<00:01:51.620> with<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
on to this TV out thing with the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.580 
on to this TV out thing with the
complexity<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.300> 3d<00:01:53.720> images<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.230> can<00:01:54.350> draw

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
complexity of the 3d images you can draw

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.480 
complexity of the 3d images you can draw
is<00:01:54.650> pretty<00:01:55.040> neat<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.920> TV<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.370> I'm

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
is pretty neat so this the TV that I'm

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.460 
is pretty neat so this the TV that I'm
displaying<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.030> on<00:01:59.090> was<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.540> bought<00:01:59.900> it<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.110> eBay

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
displaying it on was I bought it on eBay

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.580 
displaying it on was I bought it on eBay
I<00:02:00.500> think<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.950> was<00:02:01.040> 13<00:02:01.850> bucks<00:02:02.180> or<00:02:02.360> something<00:02:02.590> you

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I think it was 13 bucks or something you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.270 
I think it was 13 bucks or something you
can<00:02:03.710> see<00:02:03.890> how<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.010> hooked<00:02:04.280> up<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.490> wires<00:02:04.820> here

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
can see how I hooked up the wires here

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280 
can see how I hooked up the wires here
there's<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.520> much<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:09.170> could

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
there's not much to it you could

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.920 
there's not much to it you could
probably<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.460> cheap<00:02:11.450> cable<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.840> had

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
probably do it for a cheap cable you had

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.660 
probably do it for a cheap cable you had
laying<00:02:12.110> around<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.620> two<00:02:12.740> resistors<00:02:13.280> an

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
laying around and two resistors an

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.690 
laying around and two resistors an
Arduino<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.410> plug<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.620> into<00:02:15.800> any<00:02:16.160> TV

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
Arduino you can plug this into any TV

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.370 
Arduino you can plug this into any TV
NTSC<00:02:17.540> TV<00:02:22.090> there's<00:02:23.090> not<00:02:23.270> very<00:02:23.480> good<00:02:23.690> video<00:02:23.870> but

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
NTSC TV there's not very good video but

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.890 
NTSC TV there's not very good video but
I'll<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> schematics<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.480> comment

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
I'll have the schematics in the comment

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.870 
I'll have the schematics in the comment
section<00:02:27.500> or<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> more<00:02:28.010> information<00:02:28.520> section

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
section or the more information section

that's<00:02:29.060> where<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.270> cut<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.570> up<00:02:29.690> try<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.290> cut<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
that's where I cut it up try and cut it

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.320 
that's where I cut it up try and cut it
as<00:02:30.890> close<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> end<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.940> cable<00:02:32.270> as

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
as close to the end of the cable as

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.170 
as close to the end of the cable as
possibly<00:02:32.870> give<00:02:32.990> yourself<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> most<00:02:33.560> cable<00:02:34.180> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
possibly give yourself the most cable to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.920 
possibly give yourself the most cable to
plug<00:02:35.360> into<00:02:35.570> your<00:02:35.780> TV<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.410> not<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.770> be
