00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
what's up they all have names to be

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
what's up they all have names to be
clear<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.160> mindstorms<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> basically<00:00:36.360> Legos

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
clear what mindstorms is basically Legos

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.940 
clear what mindstorms is basically Legos
with<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.960> computer<00:00:37.230> built<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.829> have

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
with a computer built up so you have

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130 
with a computer built up so you have
this<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.190> box<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this little box in here right this is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
this little box in here right this is
called<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> brick<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.190> plug<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
called the brick and you plug this in in

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
called the brick and you plug this in in
the<00:00:42.540> middle<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> whatever<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.980> dude

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the middle of whatever little dude

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
the middle of whatever little dude
you're<00:00:44.760> making<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.420> he<00:00:45.989> controls<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.559> these

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you're making and he controls all these

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
you're making and he controls all these
sensors<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.760> front<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
sensors in the front would you have a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
sensors in the front would you have a
touch<00:00:49.110> sensor<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> color<00:00:49.890> sensor<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
touch sensor you have a color sensor you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
touch sensor you have a color sensor you
have<00:00:50.700> infrared<00:00:51.420> sensors<00:00:51.989> infrared<00:00:52.289> sensors

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
have infrared sensors infrared sensors

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.119 
have infrared sensors infrared sensors
and<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.719> cool<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> idea

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and it's really really cool so the idea

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
and it's really really cool so the idea
is<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> could<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.820> programming<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is that you could like programming it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
is that you could like programming it
comes<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.050> balls<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
comes with these little balls here that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
comes with these little balls here that
you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> program<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.539> guy<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you can see you can program this guy to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
you can see you can program this guy to
like<00:01:00.930> pick<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.500> ball<00:01:01.680> when<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:01.949> sees<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
like pick up a ball when he sees it and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.719 
like pick up a ball when he sees it and
then<00:01:02.850> shoot<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> target<00:01:05.189> there's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
then shoot it at like a target there's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.039 
then shoot it at like a target there's
all<00:01:05.820> kinds<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> fun<00:01:06.360> stuff<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.869> program

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
all kinds of fun stuff you can program

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
all kinds of fun stuff you can program
in<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.189> parent<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:10.580> despise<00:01:11.580> Legos

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in here now as a parent I despise Legos

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.219 
in here now as a parent I despise Legos
because<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> step<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> him<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.049> heard

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
because when you step on him they heard

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
because when you step on him they heard
a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> mean<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.630> an

eight-year-old right yeah if you gave

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
eight-year-old right yeah if you gave
him<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.299> he<00:01:18.720> doesn't<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.500> Legos

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
him this he doesn't really like Legos

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.289 
him this he doesn't really like Legos
that<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.850> Legos<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that much but if he did like Legos and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
that much but if he did like Legos and
he<00:01:21.390> put<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> all<00:01:21.780> together<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.830> much<00:01:23.040> work

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
he put it all together how much work

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
he put it all together how much work
would<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> helping<00:01:24.509> him

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
would you have to do in helping him

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
would you have to do in helping him
program<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> kid<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
program it do you think that kid can do

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
program it do you think that kid can do
this<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.420> their<00:01:27.570> own<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.080> meant<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.439> 10-plus

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this on their own it's meant for 10-plus

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
this on their own it's meant for 10-plus
so<00:01:29.189> 8<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> understand<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.780> things<00:01:30.810> are

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so 8 is it I understand these things are

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
so 8 is it I understand these things are
fairly<00:01:31.320> basic<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> low<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> logo

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
fairly basic it's the low it's the logo

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
fairly basic it's the low it's the logo
start<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> sort<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> situation<00:01:34.470> where<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> go

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
start of sort of situation where you go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
start of sort of situation where you go
5<00:01:34.979> feet<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.490> multiple<00:01:35.850> sensors<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
5 feet you have multiple sensors you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 
5 feet you have multiple sensors you
have<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.079> statements<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.650> is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
have if then statements which is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that shoot balls will eventually end up

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.150

this new set of legos you know what I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.380 
this new set of legos you know what I
mean<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.220> that's<00:03:34.340> really<00:03:34.610> who<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.120> aimed

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
mean but that's really who this is aimed

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.930 
mean but that's really who this is aimed
at<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.230> I'm<00:03:36.980> gonna<00:03:37.100> give<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.370> fly<00:03:37.580> as<00:03:37.640> well

at so I'm gonna give it a fly as well
but<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.209> think<00:03:38.450> there<00:03:38.600> are<00:03:38.690> some<00:03:38.810> tweaks<00:03:39.080> that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
but I think there are some tweaks that

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.390 
but I think there are some tweaks that
could<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.680> could<00:03:39.739> happen<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> future

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
could that could happen in the future

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.190 
could that could happen in the future
generation<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:41.180> there<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.330> have<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.540> three
