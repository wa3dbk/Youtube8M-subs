like a simple game on the surface but

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
like a simple game on the surface but
being<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.119> hardcore<00:00:24.480> realistic

shots you're going to be way off target

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
shots you're going to be way off target
you<00:00:58.680> also<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.640> want<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> waste<00:01:00.090> ammo

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you also really don't want to waste ammo

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
you also really don't want to waste ammo
in<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.559> only<00:01:01.739> start<00:01:02.190> with

three mags initially unless you spend

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
more to avoid both of these issues it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
more to avoid both of these issues it
might<00:01:08.790> help<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> start<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.600> using<00:01:09.840> guns<00:01:10.170> like

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
might help to start out using guns like

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
might help to start out using guns like
the<00:01:10.560> m16<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> fires<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.390> burst<00:01:12.659> fire

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the m16 because it fires in burst fire

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
the m16 because it fires in burst fire
only<00:01:13.229> mode<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.189> almost<00:01:14.490> count<00:01:14.880> your

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
only mode and you can almost count your

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
only mode and you can almost count your
trigger<00:01:15.330> pulls<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> judge<00:01:15.990> how<00:01:16.229> much<00:01:16.259> ammo<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
trigger pulls to judge how much ammo you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
trigger pulls to judge how much ammo you
have<00:01:17.070> left<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.960> coming<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.290> number<00:01:19.470> four

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
have left and coming in at number four

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
have left and coming in at number four
is<00:01:20.130> where<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> decent<00:01:20.820> headset<00:01:21.540> unlike<00:01:22.500> games

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
is where a decent headset unlike games

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
is where a decent headset unlike games
like<00:01:23.100> bf4<00:01:23.390> insurgency<00:01:24.390> doesn't<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
like bf4 insurgency doesn't have a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.630 
like bf4 insurgency doesn't have a
mini-map<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> therefore<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
mini-map and therefore the only way to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
mini-map and therefore the only way to
detect<00:01:27.000> enemy<00:01:27.420> players<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.680> eyes

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
detect enemy players is with your eyes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
detect enemy players is with your eyes
and<00:01:29.220> ears<00:01:29.820> sound<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.020> important<00:01:31.560> in

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and ears sound is really important in

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
and ears sound is really important in
this<00:01:31.740> game<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.579> tell<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.880> where

really need to make sure that your

possible<00:02:56.030> crouching<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.150> probably<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> most

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
possible crouching is probably the most

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.320 
possible crouching is probably the most
useful<00:02:58.170> stance<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.310> reduces<00:03:00.000> weapon

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
useful stance because it reduces weapon

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.180 
useful stance because it reduces weapon
sway<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.720> increases<00:03:01.110> accuracy<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.830> well<00:03:02.069> as

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
sway and increases accuracy as well as

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
sway and increases accuracy as well as
letting<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.549> peek<00:03:02.760> over<00:03:03.090> objects<00:03:03.450> without

letting you peek over objects without
standing<00:03:04.349> going<00:03:05.220> prone<00:03:05.489> makes<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:05.940> less

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
standing going prone makes you less

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.699 
standing going prone makes you less
mobile<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:06.780> it's<00:03:06.900> probably<00:03:07.290> more<00:03:07.440> effective

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
mobile but it's probably more effective

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.770 
mobile but it's probably more effective
for<00:03:08.069> LMG<00:03:08.519> users<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.330> when<00:03:09.569> playing

for LMG users or when playing

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
defensively because it significantly

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.940

aiming down sights in insurgency aiming
down<00:03:22.320> sights<00:03:22.680> takes<00:03:23.040> considerably<00:03:23.609> longer

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
down sights takes considerably longer

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.819 
down sights takes considerably longer
than<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.209> does<00:03:24.359> in<00:03:24.660> games<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.079> bf4

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
than it does in games like bf4

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.890 
than it does in games like bf4
and<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.400> even<00:03:26.760> longer<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.239> higher<00:03:27.510> powered

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
optics sometimes you just don't have

time to 80s in close quarters and you

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.009 
time to 80s in close quarters and you
find<00:03:32.489> out<00:03:32.609> very<00:03:32.880> quickly<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.510> often<00:03:33.840> better

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
find out very quickly it's often better

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.080

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
to rely on hipfire even though you don't

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
have a hipfire crosshair it's a good

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
have a hipfire crosshair it's a good
idea<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.670> 80s<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.420> early<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:39.989> where<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.319> think

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
idea to 80s in early on where you think

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.289 
idea to 80s in early on where you think
your<00:03:40.650> enemies<00:03:40.980> are<00:03:41.100> going<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.280> appear<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
you get the drop on them rather than the

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.190 
you get the drop on them rather than the
other<00:03:44.069> way<00:03:44.220> around<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.389> do<00:03:45.540> get<00:03:45.780> surprised

though just be aware that running from

though just be aware that running from
an<00:03:47.819> enemy<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> bad<00:03:48.540> idea<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:49.260> game<00:03:49.530> so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
