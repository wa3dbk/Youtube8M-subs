00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

races<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.920> course<00:00:38.280> through<00:00:38.520> his<00:00:38.670> body<00:00:39.440> maybe

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
races that course through his body maybe

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.310 
races that course through his body maybe
so<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.239> can<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> understand<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.020> too

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so I can kind of understand that too

I can make pacts with summon spirits I

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
I can make pacts with summon spirits I
probably<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:52.140> probably<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:53.160> else<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.579> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the mana of the natural world requires

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390 
the mana of the natural world requires
some<00:01:07.260> elven<00:01:07.619> blood<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.040> flowing<00:01:08.280> through

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
some elven blood to be flowing through

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.530 
some elven blood to be flowing through
you<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.450> Kratos<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> zelos<00:01:11.010> -<00:01:11.280> yeah<00:01:12.180> they

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you then Kratos and zelos - yeah they

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450 
you then Kratos and zelos - yeah they
might<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.900> some<00:01:13.080> elven<00:01:13.350> blood<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.650> them<00:01:13.830> just

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
at me differently and I thought to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
at me differently and I thought to
myself<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.549> must<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.000> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
myself this is what it must be like for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
myself this is what it must be like for
half<00:01:24.479> elves<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.320> did<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.250> ever

my<00:02:22.420> shoulders<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.770> know<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.400> okay<00:02:24.730> just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
my shoulders to know that it's okay just

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.530 
my shoulders to know that it's okay just
to<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.810> alive<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.470> know<00:02:26.620> well<00:02:27.460> yeah<00:02:27.820> that's<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.640 
failed in my duties and I ran for making
pacts<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.870> always<00:02:37.870> thought<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.110> myself<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.590> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
pacts I always thought of myself as a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.000 
pacts I always thought of myself as a
burden<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.780> after<00:02:41.200> seeing<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.590> say

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
burden I see but after seeing you say

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.800 
burden I see but after seeing you say
exactly<00:02:42.280> what<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.880> mean<00:02:43.000> I'm<00:02:43.360> holding

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
exactly what you mean I'm holding

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.870 
exactly what you mean I'm holding
anything<00:02:44.170> back<00:02:44.380> time<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.280> time<00:02:45.430> again<00:02:45.459> I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
anything back time and time again I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.530 
anything back time and time again I
started<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.170> maybe<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.620> could<00:02:47.920> just

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
started to think that maybe I could just

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.949 
started to think that maybe I could just
be<00:02:49.540> myself<00:02:49.890> really<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:52.390> quite<00:02:52.600> get<00:02:52.810> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
be myself really I don't quite get it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.800 
be myself really I don't quite get it
really<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:55.030> started<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.450> think<00:02:55.690> that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
really I think I started to think that

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.660 
really I think I started to think that
way<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.530> live<00:02:56.800> your<00:02:56.980> life<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.459> such

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
way because you live your life in such

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.060 
way because you live your life in such
earnest<00:02:59.100> I<00:03:00.300> think<00:03:01.300> that's<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.750> compliment<00:03:01.959> I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.580 

wish<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.160> meet<00:03:06.310> those<00:03:06.459> could<00:03:06.700> feel<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.030> too

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
wish to meet those could feel that too

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.949 
wish to meet those could feel that too
Methos<00:03:08.590> if<00:03:09.430> he<00:03:09.700> lived<00:03:09.940> his<00:03:10.090> life<00:03:10.150> as<00:03:10.510> earnestly

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
Methos if he lived his life as earnestly

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.960 
Methos if he lived his life as earnestly
as<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.290> do<00:03:11.470> maybe<00:03:12.160> he<00:03:12.340> wouldn't<00:03:12.580> be<00:03:12.700> able<00:03:12.820> to

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
as you do maybe he wouldn't be able to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.550 
as you do maybe he wouldn't be able to
snuff<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.720> lives<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.170> those<00:03:14.320> who<00:03:14.380> are

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.070 
snuff out the lives of those who are
trying<00:03:14.800> just<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.370> hard<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.730> live<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.239> don't<00:03:16.959> know
