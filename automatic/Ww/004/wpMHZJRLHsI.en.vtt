makes ringlets and I saw one review of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
makes ringlets and I saw one review of
someone<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.989> had<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> smaller<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> she

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
someone that had the smaller one and she

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
someone that had the smaller one and she
was<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.899> mean<00:01:04.049> she<00:01:04.229> had<00:01:04.530> real

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
was really really I mean she had real

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.230 
was really really I mean she had real
ringlets<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.060> wasn't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
ringlets in there and it just wasn't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
ringlets in there and it just wasn't
wasn't<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> look<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
wasn't the look I was going for so I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
wasn't the look I was going for so I
knew<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.000> wouldn't<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> picked

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
knew that I wouldn't like it so I picked

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
knew that I wouldn't like it so I picked
this<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.830> instead<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this one up instead and I think it was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.550 
this one up instead and I think it was
like<00:01:12.210> 30<00:01:13.070> 499<00:01:14.070> somewhere<00:01:14.790> around<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
like 30 499 somewhere around there and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
like 30 499 somewhere around there and
it's<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.890> curved<00:01:17.430> check<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:18.180> two<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's the curved check there's two so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
it's the curved check there's two so
this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:20.070> sure<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> know<00:01:20.640> there's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this is and I'm sure I know there's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
this is and I'm sure I know there's
other<00:01:21.000> brands<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.710> might

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
other brands that make it and that might

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
other brands that make it and that might
have<00:01:22.920> been<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.759> could<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.030> Conair<00:01:24.509> or

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
have been it could be Conair or

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.260 
have been it could be Conair or
something<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
something and that would be I think I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
something and that would be I think I
saw<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.840> Target<00:01:28.140> Lea<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.009> curl<00:01:29.850> my

kind<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.219> ways<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.030> haven't<00:01:57.930> been

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
kind of ways which I haven't been

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
kind of ways which I haven't been
getting<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.799> using<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> regular<00:01:59.520> client<00:01:59.670> on

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
getting just using a regular client on

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
getting just using a regular client on
or<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.290> hair<00:02:01.500> curly

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
or if you see if you see my hair curly

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.370 
or if you see if you see my hair curly
you<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> looks<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.899> weird<00:02:04.079> but

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you see it looks kind of weird but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.870 
you see it looks kind of weird but
anyway<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.040> why<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.340> hoping<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
anyway that's why I'm hoping this is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
anyway that's why I'm hoping this is
going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> give<00:02:06.600> me<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> look<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
going to give me the look that I want I

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.150 
going to give me the look that I want I
don't<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.610> these<00:02:08.759> huge<00:02:08.970> expectations<00:02:10.160> but

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't have these huge expectations but

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.730 
don't have these huge expectations but
we're<00:02:11.790> gonna<00:02:11.940> say<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
we're gonna say it's just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.710 
we're gonna say it's just
what<00:02:12.890> happens<00:02:13.220> okay<00:02:13.490> all<00:02:14.270> right<00:02:14.390> let<00:02:14.510> me<00:02:14.570> heat

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
what happens okay all right let me heat

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.440 
what happens okay all right let me heat
this<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:14.990> right<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.410> here<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:16.970> turned

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
this up right on here and when I turned

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.400 
this up right on here and when I turned
it<00:02:17.570> on<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:19.040> not<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:20.060> flickering<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.140> I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
it on it's not like flickering so I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.690 
it on it's not like flickering so I
don't<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.280> ready

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
don't know when it's ready

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670 
don't know when it's ready
so<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> one<00:02:23.780> thing<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.230> noticed

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so that is the one thing that I noticed

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680 
so that is the one thing that I noticed
right<00:02:24.830> away<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.240> kind<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.540> have

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
right away is that I just kind of have

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.480 
right away is that I just kind of have
to<00:02:26.720> guess<00:02:27.020> when<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.500> hot<00:02:27.650> enough<00:02:27.890> tip<00:02:28.310> up

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
to guess when it's hot enough tip up

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.360 
to guess when it's hot enough tip up
here<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.850> not<00:02:29.120> hot<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.740> give<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> a

hair so that the the ends look all kinky
like<00:05:07.000> that's<00:05:07.330> what<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:08.110> looks<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:09.630> which<00:05:10.630> I

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
like that's what it looks like which I

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.430 
like that's what it looks like which I
know<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:11.110> kind<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.380> like<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:13.020> but<00:05:14.020> not<00:05:14.200> like

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
know is kind of like in but not like

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.200 
know is kind of like in but not like
this<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.860> think<00:05:14.920> too<00:05:15.250> much<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.490> my<00:05:15.790> ends<00:05:16.150> are

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
this I think too much of my ends are

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.420 
this I think too much of my ends are
being<00:05:16.450> left<00:05:16.630> out<00:05:16.840> is<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.260> problem<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:18.160> says

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
being left out is the problem it says

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.400 
being left out is the problem it says
that<00:05:18.760> leave<00:05:19.210> your<00:05:19.360> ends<00:05:19.630> out<00:05:19.780> but<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.020> think<00:05:20.110> too

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
that leave your ends out but I think too

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.890 
that leave your ends out but I think too
much<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.860> my<00:05:21.010> ends<00:05:21.370> are<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.640> easy<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.150> an

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
much of my ends are as easy of an

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.750 
much of my ends are as easy of an
apparatus<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.710> use<00:05:23.890> is<00:05:24.130> that<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.370> thought<00:05:24.640> it

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
apparatus to use is that I thought it

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:43.880 
apparatus to use is that I thought it
was<00:05:24.850> why<00:05:24.970> they

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.330 

does<00:05:44.890> help<00:05:45.100> set<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.490> curls

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
does help set the curls

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.900 
does help set the curls
hair<00:05:47.580> around<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.090> finger<00:05:48.800> to<00:05:49.800> relax<00:05:50.160> texture

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
hair around the finger to relax texture

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.020 
hair around the finger to relax texture
and<00:05:51.120> create<00:05:51.930> separation<00:05:53.030> okay<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:55.970> don't<00:05:56.970> know

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
and create separation okay I don't know

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.150 
and create separation okay I don't know
what<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.240> means<00:05:57.479> but<00:05:57.780> I'm<00:05:58.500> assuming<00:05:58.889> that

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
what that means but I'm assuming that

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.950 
what that means but I'm assuming that
means<00:05:59.250> that<00:06:04.460> okay<00:06:05.460> loosen<00:06:06.060> across<00:06:06.479> by<00:06:06.600> gently

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
means that okay loosen across by gently

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:18.860 
means that okay loosen across by gently
shaking<00:06:07.290> them

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.870 

the<00:06:19.870> cool<00:06:20.080> part<00:06:20.410> it's<00:06:20.590> a<00:06:20.710> shaking<00:06:21.370> but<00:06:21.550> this<00:06:21.730> is

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
the cool part it's a shaking but this is

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:31.020 
the cool part it's a shaking but this is
what<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:25.020> okay<00:06:27.000> what<00:06:28.000> are<00:06:28.060> we<00:06:28.150> thinking<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:30.520> I

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
what I okay what are we thinking so I

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.930 
what I okay what are we thinking so I
was<00:06:31.510> looking<00:06:32.110> for<00:06:32.350> just<00:06:32.530> texture<00:06:33.160> and<00:06:33.430> a

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
was looking for just texture and a

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.170 
was looking for just texture and a
tousled<00:06:34.840> look<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.590> volume<00:06:36.460> which<00:06:36.760> is<00:06:36.940> what<00:06:37.150> I

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
tousled look and volume which is what I

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.910 
tousled look and volume which is what I
got<00:06:37.510> it's<00:06:37.780> not<00:06:37.960> real<00:06:39.600> curl<00:06:40.600> curl<00:06:43.710> so<00:06:44.710> maybe

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
got it's not real curl curl so maybe

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.900 
got it's not real curl curl so maybe
this<00:06:45.040> isn't<00:06:45.250> as<00:06:45.460> bad<00:06:45.730> as<00:06:45.870> I'm<00:06:47.790> thinking<00:06:48.790> it

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
this isn't as bad as I'm thinking it

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.970 
this isn't as bad as I'm thinking it
isn't<00:06:49.180> this<00:06:49.270> mirror<00:06:49.570> just<00:06:49.870> like<00:06:50.710> there's<00:06:50.890> a

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
isn't this mirror just like there's a

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.250 
isn't this mirror just like there's a
lot<00:06:51.220> of<00:06:51.340> hair<00:06:56.670> that's<00:06:57.670> better

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
lot of hair that's better

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.190 
lot of hair that's better
okay<00:07:01.080> first<00:07:02.080> time<00:07:03.270> first<00:07:04.270> time<00:07:04.540> you<00:07:04.720> buy<00:07:04.930> I

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
ringlets it's more like a beachy kind of
