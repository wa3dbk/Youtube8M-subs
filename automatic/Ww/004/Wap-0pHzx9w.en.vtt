00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.700
 Nothing is more pleasant in winter than a delicious stew. 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.520
 Convenient ! You can prepare this tasty chicken fricassee with tomatoes and mushrooms 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 the day before. 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.210
 It will be even better the same day. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.250
 While our chicken breasts thaw, we slice the onions and garlic chips. 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.610
 Mushrooms are always good in a simmered dish; you just have to cut them 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.130
 in 4. 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.520
 Let's go to chicken breasts. 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.521
 Spice them with salt and black pepper before cooking. 

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.790
 Brown them in a little olive oil, then remove them from the pan. 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.160
 Instead of chicken, brown the bacon. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.730
 When they are crisp, add the garlic and chopped onions, and make them come back 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 moments. 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.120
 The mushrooms are also tossed, mixing. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 Now you can put the chicken pieces back in the pan and add a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.079
 box of peeled tomatoes and a bay leaf. 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.790
 We wet with red wine and chicken broth, and simmer over low heat. 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.710
 To flavor this dish, decorate it generously with paprika and cayenne pepper. 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.010
 That's it, as soon as we reach boiling, we lower the fire and let it simmer under cover 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.420
 for three quarters of an hour. 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 It's ready, just add a few spoonfuls of black olives and warm up 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 all. 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.840
 If necessary, adjust the salt and pepper seasoning again. 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380
 For those who do not like olives, just delete them. 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.710
 This fricassee is just as delicious without! 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.530
 As an accompaniment, you can, among other things, offer baguette or semolina 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.079
 wheat, for a southern note. 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.350
 But with fries or croquettes, it's also delicious. 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.329
 A fresh and fruity red wine like this Chianti Villa Sopita from Tuscany will marry wonderfully 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.409
 with this dish raised. 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.530
 Enjoy your meal !
