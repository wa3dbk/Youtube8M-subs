sprinting<00:06:06.439> out<00:06:06.530> of<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.770> notes<00:06:06.949> of<00:06:07.099> a<00:06:07.189> chord<00:06:07.479> so

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
sprinting out of the notes of a chord so

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.689 
sprinting out of the notes of a chord so
if<00:06:08.539> you<00:06:08.659> hear<00:06:08.810> each<00:06:08.930> one<00:06:09.219> individually
