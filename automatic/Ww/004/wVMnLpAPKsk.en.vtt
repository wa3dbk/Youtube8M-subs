 interfere with advertising click the cross in the top 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:12.059
 right corner hello with you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.350
 alexander channel tire fitting uid and today 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.060
 we say and when to buy tires and here 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 There are two options either pasta or early 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.560
 better early than late though if you are early 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 buy tires is not a fact that you buy 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 old tires and if you buy late then 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 you buy and not the fact that the new is well 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 expensive 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.690
 what a joke explaining is very simple here with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 This trend for some reason appeared that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 before each season 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.140
 crab need to change the summer form in the name 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 life I talked about the rise in price 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 trends that really more than 100 rubles 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.649
 Well, that's why yeah, choose the rubber hour 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 putting hyip is okay 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.990
 here is just that 100 we then I said that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.380
 you can buy sooner or later sooner 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.479
 can buy last year's tires for 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.080
 winter is undesirable it is better to buy it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.369
 Svezhak is still so so there stands on 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.049
 weeks I already told you how the video 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.050
 read the inscriptions that they mean 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 so here 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 tires should not always be fresh 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.670
 it happens that without saying five 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.810
 years of this is all nonsense 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:41.190
 I already told you about it 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 take care of rubber rubber more precisely in 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.970
 end of February 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.130
 that's just the end of February begins 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.130
 filling all the warehouses of your city 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 it's about summer tires 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.410
 If we consider winter tires, then this 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.410
 end of August beginning of September 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 I will explain for some reason, so they just 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.510
 care tourism 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.780
 still the demand is not very big stuff 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.760
 warehouses 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.990
 then begins to slowly press the base 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.150
 market hucksters dealers 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:33.260
 starting to quietly with a buy but but there is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.760
 huckster is also not much therapy in which 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.410
 plan 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 suitable spring they also have 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.390
 certain let's say the goods they already 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.420
 invested money to sell her donilon from 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.630
 plague prices and in price trends they 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.760
 develop well so here they are 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.460
 do as fits season 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.000
 drift tires immediately not mechanically 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.600
 Go to these warehouses 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.200
 mechanically not gazelle 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.130
 take out from there all all that is possible here and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.760
 if you don't hurry let's say at the end 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.830
 February early March 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 then there is a suitable normal 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.300
 quality rubber you want you 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.030
 you will not find it will be just full 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.740
 consumer goods such as rah any Russian 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.870
 Ukrainian and Belarusian but will not 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.180
 imported good rubber music is 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.800
 import this polish tank this is some kind 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.810
 Three times really well, no more than that 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.910
 the very trend and is that in spring and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.080
 In the summer, they constantly row Allah these 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.740
 wholesale warehouses 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.790
 direct delivery to the market does not occur 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.880
 so the cost chef tires say 3 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.190
 markups it costs at the bus stop 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.770
 so much then us quadris only 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.880
 then at the market drains therefore 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.150
 it turns out that they take off in thirty 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.640
 take off the last pants so 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.980
 take care of choosing rubber now 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.340
 Spring is coming soon 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.090
 Well, it's too early to put on rubber, but she 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.000
 should already be if we admit it already 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:27.880
