 125 gram weight jar 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 we have a potato cream and then 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.239
 we replace those that are potatoes a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 classic steamed cubes 40 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 grams 160 grams of recco di trofiette 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.239
 fresh green beans 40 grams salt how much 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.339
 enough and oil of Taggiasca origin 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.699
 extra virgin olive oil mill of sant'agata 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.699
 of oneglia 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.350
 the first 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.059
 do but let's cook our own 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.329
 recco of recco that have like 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.589
 cook five minutes then water 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.360
 boiling well salted when after three 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.229
 minutes I will cook together 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.180
 our green beans to our trofiette 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.030
 we said I don't use potatoes 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.220
 boiled but I use a cream that is 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.899
 lukewarm I don't want it too much 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.659
 hot 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:22.490
 Meanwhile I prepare pesto I usually 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.600
 since pesto is a sauce based on 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.369
 chlorophyll 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.740
 I don't want to bring this sauce 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.440
 above 60 degrees because I want that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.750
 the pesto remains green so that you don't 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.090
 take heat and then release the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.450
 its aroma that this happens under 60 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 temperature degrees for two portions of 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.350
 trofie usually I put I go a little 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.050
 be careful we are not here to weigh 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.119
 however usually 3 tablespoons of pesto 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.130
 they are more than enough 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.050
 now what we do I use this 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.509
 bull put a dash of cooking water 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.989
 to cool our pesto sauce 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.390
 and also to ensure that thanks to 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.129
 pulses of the golds inside the pesto 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 it is the cooking water I put into it 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.569
 I'm going to create an emulsion then 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.700
 this sauce binds becomes a lot 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.650
 creamed while it cools and will be 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.239
 optimal for the preparation in ours 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
 dish 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.950
 3 minutes have passed but in cooking i 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.450
 our green beans that I want them on 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.060
 crunchy so I don't want cooking 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.050
 too long 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.470
 et voila 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.450
 let's give a perfect tap like that then 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.840
 gentlemen now our trofiette are 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.020
 ready what I do I dry them for good 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.910
 because I don't want it if I put too much water 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.740
 then in our sauce it will be difficult 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.200
 let it dry as these trophies 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.320
 in my opinion they absolutely mustn't 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 see too much heat heat 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.920
 people pass the pesto in the pan 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.110
 but in my opinion the most wrong thing of the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.390
 world now what we do let's go to 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.610
 stir with the help of a lolly 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.710
 pot or marisa as you wish 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.990
 as you can see, see the sauce 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.570
 how nice denied I didn't get caught 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.970
 heat to our pesto so look 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.190
 what a beautiful color me now 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.990
 I can manage it as I want if there is 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.250
 I want softer so better 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.490
 I add another drop 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.490
 of cooking water 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.920
 I go on in the drives I don't see 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.170
 so much excessive oil on the surface 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.350
 so I can always whisk 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 add another drop of oil without 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.150
 exaggerate because let's remember that the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.610
 pesto and a sauce also based on oil 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.890
 so you should never overdo it for not 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.050
 weigh down too much as you can well 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.120
 see our our trophies are 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.070
 well creamed you see that creaminess that 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.370
 our sauce and now we can 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.930
 proceed with the chin implant we decorate 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:06.200
 with the emulsion of pesto elongated with 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.200
 a drop of Taggiasca extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.110
 we decorate we put a law on the bottom 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.180
 the bit of potato just barely 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.730
 flavored always with ours 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.620
 usually pesto we enlarge this will be 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.700
 almost the surprise that we will find under the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.700
 our trofiette 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:34.980
 and place our trophies on it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.980
 well creamed with pesto and green beans 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.319
 obviously this is the 60 portion 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.319
 grams can possibly abound 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.139
 simple dish and voila
