00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.250
 oh, what's up, everybody speaks to them, mex and 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 well, the command is disconnected here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 forum guys, I'm already buying a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.650
 new command finally because the truth of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.380
 Estella gives penita so good 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.109
 Welcome to a new chapter of this 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 guide or if you can call it guide that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.880
 basically they are like tips on more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.640
 or less do you the best weapon that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.040
 You can carry in game and good lists 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 well as I told you in this thing that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 is disconnected as I told you in the former 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.750
 earlier in mourning for teams 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 I'm going to go by order so well I'm going to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.449
 start with the main obviously 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 what do you know then look for some of 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.620
 extreme but good right now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 main and good we stay 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 so for teams so the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.739
 accident the next would be multi 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 team and one says if they do not know it good 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.800
 here is in the description are three 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.379
 teams with three players each 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 they struggle to gain control of the map and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.609
 of objectives in a set of modes of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.790
 game or basically they are new 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.520
 players in total and three in each 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.980
 team as it says and basically I've 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.440
 played a little bit to this game mode the 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.360
 it's really not very good if you do not go with a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.340
 team if you go with a team and it's good 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 your team we 're going from you're a beast but 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.690
 if you go alone and your team is terrible 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.120
 we're done because you're leaving 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.100
 the truth so good if you were going to play 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.840
 multi equipment I recommend 100% that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 go at least with two other friends 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.180
 that it is good for them to play well 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.920
 the black ops 2 or so they play 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.229
 acceptably because it's a way of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 pretty tactical game and good says 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.340
 objectives and this game mode is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.400
 basically of objectives not aware of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.979
 low I say of fraud by teams and not what 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.800
 are the game modes that are played the most 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.869
 in this list is just point 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.759
 hot low confirmed domination and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.340
 that's how they are pure objective when 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.220
 we started with the first class more 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.440
 ok with the class and well obviously it's 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.350
 a game mode in which only 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.390
 they are new players in total or not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
 are going to give big maps of that have it for 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.830
 sure so the most advisable thing is 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.160
 wear 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.010
 and his rifle a skeptic considers in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.820
 English and good in my case you can use the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.920
 mp7 or the p of w 57 that are weapons 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.190
 pretty good so I will not go here 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.130
 the mp7 and I highly recommend you whoever 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.530
 carry something similar to the muffler 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.240
 good basically so you do not go out in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.760
 the radar because I already tell you this is a 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.370
 very tactical game mode in which the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.960
 surprise element is imperative as well 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.990
 what good to the plan of the element of surprise 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.850
 Ghost is a very good park line 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.130
 it does not last and now I explain why because 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.160
 obviously as I said it is a game 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.560
 of pure objectives mostly and 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.570
 because it lends itself to you not going to be able to 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.450
 To kill too much, do not go out to spurts 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.510
 very high but go for the goal 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.790
 So the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 surprise elements is a must as well 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.190
 that ghost is a very good option in 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 the advantage 2 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.970
 I would recommend using more or less hardness or 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.620
 yes no scavenger but I recommend you 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.210
 even more harsh on the issue that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 there is a lot of close combat by the 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.770
 the reduced ones of the maps and the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.350
 basically hardness players 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.960
 to win all the one against ones and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.630
 of advantage 3 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.250
 we have skill these 6 and good the one 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.250
 I will always always put and the one 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.990
 I recommend you go super super super 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.270
 He is widely an engineer for 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.630
 basically know where all the 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.700
 teams of enemies because as they 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.020
 I said they are like this for example in points 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.550
 hot they are going to obviously put 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.620
 float inside the hot spot with 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.290
 bones and is with receives with shocks of 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.140
 load so imperative engineer 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.020
 good for high school because what I 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.220
 always use is the 22 or the one that 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.730
 right now I'm really liking the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.040
 attack 45 any of those two weapons of 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.080
 secondary are very very pretty deadly 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.160
 of hyper recommend that you carry link 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.130
 without seeing and because as I said are games 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.170
 of the goal basically and good I do not 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.730
 I have it unlocked here but let's 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.010
 use the voice without seeing and you can leave 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.730
 this space reserved for the voice without 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.440
 ask what it does not take away and the tactics the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.450
 load of said that is pretty good 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.090
 but eye guys do not get to change 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.220
 please however I believe that still 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.650
 more it is recommended that the acre said 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.420
 what is the black hat and why 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.550
 because they are obviously going to put you 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.930
 guardians are going to put sentries that 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.150
 are the turrets that are you 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.920
 shooting and killing so good for 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.080
 destroy that and enter with all 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.740
 tranquility and dominate we use the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.800
 black hat ok and good i'm going 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.920
 six plus the lethal one he can not put 7 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.440
 tactical kill 8 I recommend you take 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.260
 two black hats although good is a 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.910
 little bit too much so better take one in 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.420
 total we have 8 we are going to put another 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.120
 accessory to mp 7 will see what will be 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.130
 good grip, it worked for me 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.960
 well when I got it in gold as 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.300
 can see is the only one his rifle that the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.700
 I have gold and well we have this 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.470
 a total of 9 so good could you 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.200
 put 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.480
 accessory your second class of devotees 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.950
 clear second weapon or else carry another 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.380
 black hat and I tell you the hat 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.390
 essential black and good guys then 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.960
 these basically the class with which I 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.110
 I would play the multi team as I told you 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.960
 a game mode more than anything tactical and 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.660
 especially that it is based on game modes 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.750
 of objective but obviously I repeat it if 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.000
 you go alone that's not going to work 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.800
 too much because it's a super game 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.410
 tactical where you have to be at a hundred 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.660
 with your team on the subject of communication 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.340
 and well, nothing, guys, the next 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.810
 will be a mercenary pit to the truth 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.100
 I have played this game mode not now 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.080
 I will be playing it to see what it is 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.850
 try and bring you the best 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.750
 recommendations so the boys then 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.130
 if they liked to leave their like if they 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.870
 like to change something of the class or if 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.820
 they have some other opinion with everything 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.680
 please leave it in the comments and then 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.900
 obviously we will make the modifications 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.960
 relevant so well then I am 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.040
 Mark next and see you in the next 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.040
 goodbye video
