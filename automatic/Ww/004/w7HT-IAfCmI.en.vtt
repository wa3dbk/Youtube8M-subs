up<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:12.649> hopefully<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:14.000> will<00:01:14.149> work

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:20.600 
bunch of magnesium's from this magnesium
block<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:12.069> I'm<00:02:12.310> gonna<00:02:12.489> try<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:15.250> light<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:19.590> by

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
block and I'm gonna try to light this by

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.729 
block and I'm gonna try to light this by
hitting<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.849> striker<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.629> this<00:02:23.049> spark<00:02:23.440> here

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
hitting this striker on this spark here

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.750 
hitting this striker on this spark here
I<00:02:24.900> didn't<00:02:25.900> use<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.319> much<00:02:26.560> magnesium<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.610> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I didn't use as much magnesium as I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.600 
I didn't use as much magnesium as I
probably<00:02:28.030> should<00:02:28.299> have<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.310> quite

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
probably should have so I'm not quite

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.870 
probably should have so I'm not quite
sure<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.239> gonna<00:02:31.390> actually<00:02:31.599> start<00:02:32.880> but

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880
