00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.750
 ah 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 hello how are my name is fernando 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.030
 ibÃ¡Ã±ez and today we are going to talk about 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.080
 of one of the most recognized brands in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 everyone in the car audio 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.710
 morel the brand morel was founded in the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 75 in israel and thanks to these guys 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.320
 that created a series of speakers with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.060
 very very good sound and also winners 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 in many events at the international level 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.650
 was that they created the car audio line I 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 they had already won with the home series or 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 be speakers for home then they created the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.630
 car audio line our friends mobile 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.340
 mordechai and very recently we 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.260
 they had given the representation here the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 Peru we have begun to bring 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.670
 this new brand of speakers we are going to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 talk about the maximum the series a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 maximum 6 of morel which is the most 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.880
 economic but we're going to see some 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.390
 details that we have not seen before 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.400
 details like what we see here in it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 in the manual that comes in the box 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 for example you have here the impedance 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.090
 nominal in the nominal impedance the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.000
 resistor having your speaker's 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.100
 commercial resistance to the most commercial 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.650
 for this type of car components 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.400
 in four more 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.710
 and we see here in the speaker manual 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.090
 which says abdominal resistance 4000 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.790
 you also have a rms power of 90 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.380
 watts is a speaker to do the most 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.770
 economic of the brand is a speaker 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.350
 quite powerful we have in general in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.670
 average power of 50-60 for the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.130
 cheaper series in all the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.830
 marks but in this special case the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.430
 maximum two way of morel has 90 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 watts rms output in power is 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.820
 quite powerful for the average of the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 speakers of the other speakers of the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.500
 market we have here a cardboard cone 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610
 the cardboard is one of those 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.390
 most used materials in all 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.560
 speakers we have this the showdown or the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.150
 around the speaker that is the system 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.319
 of cushioning that most use 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.900
 of components 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.270
 this here is the coil the coil is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.000
 slightly wider than average 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.940
 if we see in the specific manual a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.430
 one inch diameter coil one 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.040
 inch diameter for a speaker 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.430
 economic is pretty high enough 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.950
 pretty big wide let's see what 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.319
 other things come inside the box 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.930
 and we've seen the grids with the logo 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.879
 of the brand at the bottom we have 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.260
 obviously a sticker so I can 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.510
 put in your car wherever you want 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.189
 always people ask me and how many 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.430
 speakers come inside the box of a 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.079
 game components always come 2 that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.930
 is one for the left and one for the 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.730
 right for the doors you can not 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.079
 put it on the front doors in the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.530
 later even in the tray 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.290
 After educating, the 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.380
 thicknesses and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.140
 two tweeters in the next manual 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.569
 together with a loudspeaker says that the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.600
 tweeter has an one inch 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.600
 diameter 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:04.110
 just as it is an inch in diameter 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 on the bobbin of your speaker twitter 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.780
 The thread is the same size as the bobbin 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.110
 of these copper coils just in case and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.020
 the range of frequencies you have for 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.970
 this speaker according to the manual that comes 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.900
 is 50 antler 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.230
 from 50 hearts to 20,000 hertz this 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.330
 means that it covers the whole of 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 range of frequencies that exist 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.189
 the twitter of this the twitter of this 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.800
 neon inning speaker and that of the 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.330
 high grade ferrite speaker other 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.490
 which we can see here in the manual 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.930
 is how it is installed 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.910
 how do you install in these games 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.470
 components and it 's super simple 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.680
 amplifier to the crossover input 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.610
 and the crossover income also 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.120
 you install on twitter you install the medium and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.370
 let's check here the crossover 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.590
 what is a crossover is another of the things 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.210
 they always ask me 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.730
 a crossover is a divisor of 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.360
 frequencies is a frequency divider 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.430
 makes speaker because your game 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.470
 components sound better than any 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.590
 another speaker that you have elegant that 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.920
 any coaxial dual triaxial and so on 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.230
 because because it sends half frequencies 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.900
 to this speaker that is the one that reproduces 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.150
 the mid frequencies and sends the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.920
 sharp to this speaker that is believed to 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.770
 reproduces the high frequencies and that 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.110
 things are the same average frequencies 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.210
 the middle frequencies are the voices 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.130
 voices and the basses this actually in a 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.100
 two-way background this is a low medium 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.490
 and the low medium reproduces the voices and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.440
 the basses or the drums the drums 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.750
 and this reproduces the dishes 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.350
 crickets the sharpest parts of our 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.800
 voice 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.530
 this is all that comes in a game of 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.930
 maximum component of 2 days that a 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.930
 purpose is of offer these days 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.720
 well see you next time 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.110
 we see another day to check some other 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.110
 product 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.699
 yes
