00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.660
 i 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 good to me the sport that in itself that more 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 it strikes me I also liked 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.530
 true boxing portals so rude 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 true that this was but this for several 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.660
 Facts true, I could not follow it anymore 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 is doing one of them that a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 me my mom did not like that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 sport true this one decides that yes 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.040
 she was not hitting me at home 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.970
 I was going to want nobody else to be 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.970
 hitting on the street 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 one day for not wanting me to stay and if what 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.329
 bored the house by myself and permission 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.949
 for we can accompany they gave me permission 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.510
 and then the truth at that time the 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.180
 current coach was the former mayor 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.570
 edwin rolando vegas you can rest 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 de ecatepec and he asked me if I 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.699
 I would like to raise people and if I 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.100
 he said he will wear a shorts or a 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.170
 shirt and tennis and the next day that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.170
 says and then since then here we are 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.259
 I think that I can tell you more 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.700
 that everything with an anecdote that 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.979
 it happened already when I was here in the capital 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.159
 when he was part of the selection 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.950
 national youth once we are 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.920
 they put goals to set goals dreams 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 in a true paper and then I 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 it was when it is at a certain point 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.079
 unaware of the sport mistake and when 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.579
 I heard there that the goals about 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.009
 the goals of the most companions 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.310
 participate in Central American games in 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.739
 a global weightlifting olympic games and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 from miami to grief and middle throat 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.170
 true because of what I was saying 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.970
 when it touched me I said good 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.979
 compete in the one I have in cova in him 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 take off for national championships 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 then the truth no no I did not have that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.289
 vision or did not dream of getting to where 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.289
 thank God I am currently dor 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.780
 it was an invitation letter like saying no 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.660
 it's not like that either truth 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.070
 the invitation letter gave me what 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 is the international federation of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.580
 weight lifting aimed at my 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.170
 people with first and last name and 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.170
 category to convert 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.540
 Well, I think that leaves a lot 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.420
 quite real experience so much more 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.230
 that everything competitive truly 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 lived experiences because they were 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.270
 enough the joy and emotion of 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.070
 be sharing with that conglomerate 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.170
 of athletes true that you can say that 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.100
 it's the best thing in the world that participates in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.100
 olympic games 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.770
 one of the goals or one of the dreams 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.630
 bigger than you can have one like 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.220
 committed high-performance athlete 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.440
 not only with my person with me 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.870
 sport but with the whole country as it is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.290
 a very important representation the one 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290
 we're going to have 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.160
 practically now the sport more than 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.490
 everything in my life 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.110
 I grew up with them sport 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.180
 I have also gone ahead in what is 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.180
 the personal and or professional 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.719
 so we go prepared knowing that it's going 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.849
 to be a very high level competition 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.189
 especially the category in which my 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.349
 person is because the division of 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.790
 heavy weights the one that calls the most 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.530
 attention in any competition 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.189
 international by the amount of weight 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.189
 that stand up 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.110
 in the main ones it is said that faith in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.730
 god truth and then second there yes that the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.370
 the constancy discipline 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.519
 perseverance and above all the attitude of 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.519
 lifetime 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.060
 that fortunately we left 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 with 12 medals one silver and one of 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.950
 bronze because also leaving precedents 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.640
 with two national level records 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.640
 and at the Central American level
