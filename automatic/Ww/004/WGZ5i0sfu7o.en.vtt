00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 review on this little thing here what 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.099
 you can with one in each car 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 radio streaming yes I have the shares 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.670
 now here in the cigar lighter 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 stuck we see here is everything 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 activates that we see a blue 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.460
 ring 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 Now we have to go to the iphone in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.329
 Settings under bluetooth and then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 we just have to select the device 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.719
 In my case, I called and prayed 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 I am already with the device 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 connected 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 that means I'm going to the app now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 for this 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.149
 which gives it for free in the app store calls 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 Tuning you have to download 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.940
 if you have not installed and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 connects you with the device would you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.719
 Immediately asked if they were going down 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.390
 So he wanted to download them 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.280
 you'll see her in the app immediately then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.340
 right here so a selection of the fn 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 frequency because here on the iphone we control 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 this little thing there we complete 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.229
 Here you can choose which frequency 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 that should have part 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.409
 I have now in my case 87 5 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.159
 that's just in here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.759
 my environment the best signal now 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.680
 I go to the car radio and then sets 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.680
 there 87 5 1 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.070
 87.5 and now I can here on the iphone 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 go to my choice in a music app 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590
 In my case it is now offered iv and me 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590
 can here 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.130
 Making music quieter and louder 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.429
 that's just listening to the music I have 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.649
 want 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.990
 the whole thing is about that 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.060
 autoradio 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.460
 which now works in any car that 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.130
 fm radio is, I guess 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.719
 actually every nowadays and therefore 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.799
 you can wirelessly transfer your music over 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.909
 Send bluetooth to your car radio 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.990
 yes I have the whole thing here again 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.829
 on the ipad show you again all gas 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.869
 set up as you can 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.869
 the settings go under bluetooth 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:18.400
 wlan here bt from the whole then takes 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.450
 until the ipad has connected here 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.049
 Now we see here it has become 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.900
 connected 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.090
 I can then right here in the app 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.670
 Switching from tuning can also be done here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.680
 set the frequency again 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:43.389
 I do it now we had here 87.5 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.600
 I want to go out of the house again here 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:53.359
 music program of my confidence and then 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 I can just play music and it 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.540
 running when the car radio and I 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.590
 can make it quieter or louder here 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.880
 that makes it quieter on the car radio 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.370
 whole works not only with music 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.200
 We can also be here for example now 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.220
 in the maps app can go to us 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.769
 let's navigate and the navi reads us 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.340
 then all the data about the car radio 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.389

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.700

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.079
 we think we have a usb port here 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.319
 can a normal cable here 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.260

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.650

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.919
