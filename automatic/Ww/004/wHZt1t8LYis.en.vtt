00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
let's get started

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.339 
let's get started
now<00:00:11.969> what<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.210> selected<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> deck<00:00:13.139> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
now what I've selected from the deck is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.950 
now what I've selected from the deck is
the<00:00:13.500> cards<00:00:13.799> from<00:00:13.980> 1<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.309> 9<00:00:14.570> you<00:00:15.570> could<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.839> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the cards from 1 to 9 you could see that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.210 
the cards from 1 to 9 you could see that
they're<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.170> hearts<00:00:16.619> except<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> two

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
they're all hearts except for the two

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.700 
they're all hearts except for the two
because<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> couldn't<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.449> hearts<00:00:18.779> 2<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
because I couldn't find the hearts 2 in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620 
because I couldn't find the hearts 2 in
my<00:00:19.920> deck<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.699> lost<00:00:20.939> somewhere<00:00:21.300> but

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
my deck because it's lost somewhere but

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
my deck because it's lost somewhere but
it<00:00:21.869> doesn't<00:00:22.230> matter<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.590> long<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.130> 1<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.430> 2

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it doesn't matter as long as it's 1 to 2

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
it doesn't matter as long as it's 1 to 2
1<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> 9<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.050> works

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
1 to 9 it all works

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.019 
1 to 9 it all works
so<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:26.250> gonna<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.519> doing<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> I'm

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so what we're gonna be doing is I'm

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
so what we're gonna be doing is I'm
gonna<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.269> asking<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> spectator<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:29.130> either

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
gonna be asking the spectator to either

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
gonna be asking the spectator to either
place<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> card<00:00:29.880> down<00:00:30.150> or<00:00:30.510> stop<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
place a card down or stop it with the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.659 
place a card down or stop it with the
wandering<00:00:31.529> beneath<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> end<00:00:32.399> we're

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
wandering beneath and at the end we're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.860 
wandering beneath and at the end we're
gonna<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> certain<00:00:33.270> order<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.780> I'm

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
gonna have a certain order that I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.810 
gonna have a certain order that I'm
gonna<00:00:33.989> try<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> predict<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.579> I've<00:00:35.670> done

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gonna try to predict now what I've done

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
gonna try to predict now what I've done
for<00:00:36.030> prediction<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:36.809> written<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.140> down

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
for prediction is I've written it down

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
for prediction is I've written it down
on<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.620> piece<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> paper<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
on this piece of paper you can see it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.990 
on this piece of paper you can see it
right<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.010> what<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.190> ask<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.730> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
right here and what I'm gonna ask is you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.529 
right here and what I'm gonna ask is you
there<00:00:42.210> place<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> card<00:00:42.809> down<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:44.550> says

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
there place a card down so down says

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.709 
there place a card down so down says
down<00:00:45.780> again<00:00:46.079> says<00:00:46.680> swap<00:00:47.239> put<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.570> top

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
down again says swap put the one on top

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.060 
down again says swap put the one on top
and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> put<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> bottom<00:00:49.800> there

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and then you put it on the bottom there

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
and then you put it on the bottom there
and<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.870> Warner<00:00:52.110> as

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and you see that that's out of Warner as

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
and you see that that's out of Warner as
you<00:00:52.590> saw<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> beginning<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.460> numbers

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you saw at the beginning the numbers

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.130 
you saw at the beginning the numbers
were<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.030> order<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.809> swamped<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.879> down

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
were in order and it was swamped so down

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.790 
were in order and it was swamped so down
say<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> swap<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.800> time<00:01:00.170> right<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
say a swap this time right there and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
say a swap this time right there and
down<00:01:02.399> obviously<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> last<00:01:03.570> card

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
down obviously this is the last card

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
down obviously this is the last card
number<00:01:04.019> 9<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:05.010> goes<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.900> alright<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.439> say

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
number 9 it goes down alright so say

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
number 9 it goes down alright so say
that<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:09.380> down<00:01:11.180> let's<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> swap<00:01:12.720> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that again down let's do a swap right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
that again down let's do a swap right
there<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> 2<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there so you see it's for the 2 so it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
there so you see it's for the 2 so it
was<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> swap<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.600> before<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:20.450> what

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
was a swap because of before so what

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.609 
was a swap because of before so what
we're<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.780> doing<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:23.180> let's<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
we're gonna be doing is let's just

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
we're gonna be doing is let's just
picking<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.650> cards<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.189> hand<00:01:26.659> let's

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
picking up cards with one hand let's

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
picking up cards with one hand let's
just<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.320> random<00:01:28.560> numbers<00:01:28.979> um<00:01:29.159> okay<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.729> how

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
just do random numbers um okay so how

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
just do random numbers um okay so how
about<00:01:30.500> down<00:01:31.500> down<00:01:32.540> swap<00:01:35.750> swap<00:01:36.750> they're<00:01:37.340> down

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
about down down swap swap they're down

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.840 
about down down swap swap they're down
down<00:01:41.930> down<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.009> however<00:01:44.340> many<00:01:44.520> times<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
down down do this however many times you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.170 
down down do this however many times you
want

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
want

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.160 
want
let's<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.420> swap<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> time

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
let's do and do a first swap this time

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.210 
let's do and do a first swap this time
let's<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.070> ok<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:52.220> another

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
let's do that and ok so there another

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.510 
let's do that and ok so there another
down<00:01:53.930> down<00:01:55.040> swap<00:01:57.590> there

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.249 

swap<00:02:03.520> our<00:02:03.729> swap<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.140> then<00:02:05.200> obviously<00:02:07.259> again

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
swap our swap and then obviously again

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.490 
swap our swap and then obviously again
so<00:02:09.479> yes<00:02:10.479> do<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.780> one<00:02:10.959> more<00:02:11.080> time<00:02:11.580> swap<00:02:13.500> down

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so yes do it one more time swap down

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:29.570 
so yes do it one more time swap down
down<00:02:18.209> swap<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.940> I'm<00:02:28.000> gonna<00:02:28.120> do<00:02:28.330> just

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
down swap down so what I'm gonna do just

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.610 
down swap down so what I'm gonna do just
gonna<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:30.850> if<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.840> prediction<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:34.150> correct

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
gonna see if this prediction was correct

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.699 
gonna see if this prediction was correct
all<00:02:35.620> right<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.370> got<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:36.880> cards<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.709> let's

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
all right so got our cards here let's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.289 
all right so got our cards here let's
see<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.160> we've<00:02:39.310> already<00:02:39.459> started<00:02:39.670> off<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.180> a

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
see so we've already started off with a

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.900 
see so we've already started off with a
three<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:40.840> that's<00:02:41.019> pretty<00:02:41.230> good<00:02:41.700> let's<00:02:42.700> see

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
three so that's pretty good let's see

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.590 
three so that's pretty good let's see
how<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.239> works<00:02:44.100> three<00:02:46.140> over<00:02:47.140> here<00:02:47.610> five<00:02:48.610> hmm

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
how this works three over here five hmm

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:04.380 
how this works three over here five hmm
pretty<00:02:50.470> good<00:02:50.709> 7<00:02:52.049> 6<00:02:53.049> 8<00:02:53.580> 9<00:02:57.810> 1<00:02:59.549> 4<00:03:01.350> 2<00:03:03.150> there<00:03:04.150> we<00:03:04.269> have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
pretty good 7 6 8 9 1 4 2 there we have

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.890 
pretty good 7 6 8 9 1 4 2 there we have
it<00:03:06.269> completely<00:03:07.269> match<00:03:07.570> my<00:03:08.470> prediction

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it completely match my prediction

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.270 
it completely match my prediction
now<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.049> trick<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.320> actually<00:03:11.440> very<00:03:11.890> simple

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
now this trick is actually very simple

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.670 
now this trick is actually very simple
the<00:03:12.850> trick<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.239> always<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.440> same

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the trick is to always have the same

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
the trick is to always have the same
prediction<00:03:15.459> number<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.390> piece<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.570> paper

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
prediction number on the piece of paper

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.440 
prediction number on the piece of paper
cardboard<00:03:17.500> box<00:03:17.890> card<00:03:18.489> box<00:03:18.730> whenever<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.299> put

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
cardboard box card box whenever you put

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.870 
cardboard box card box whenever you put
your<00:03:19.540> prediction<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:21.160> your<00:03:21.549> numbers

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
your prediction on and have your numbers

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.690 
your prediction on and have your numbers
in<00:03:22.090> order<00:03:22.269> when<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> start<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:24.130> basically

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
in order when you start so basically

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.960 
in order when you start so basically
what<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:24.970> did<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.620> ace<00:03:27.310> 2<00:03:27.579> 9<00:03:27.730> which

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
what I did is you can see ace 2 9 which

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.370 
what I did is you can see ace 2 9 which
is<00:03:28.090> 1<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:29.530> them<00:03:29.650> over<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.130> that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
is 1 and I put them over here like that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.610 
is 1 and I put them over here like that
one<00:03:32.380> hand<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:34.510> there<00:03:34.570> you're<00:03:35.230> gonna<00:03:35.350> tell

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
one hand right there you're gonna tell

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740 
one hand right there you're gonna tell
your<00:03:36.000> spectator<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.239> you've<00:03:37.390> put<00:03:37.720> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
your spectator that you've put a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.539 
your spectator that you've put a
prediction<00:03:38.140> down<00:03:38.320> what<00:03:39.040> they<00:03:39.160> think<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.519> that

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
prediction down what they think is that

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.180 
prediction down what they think is that
this<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.209> random<00:03:40.420> number<00:03:40.980> composed<00:03:41.980> of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
this is just a random number composed of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.890 
this is just a random number composed of
all<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> numbers<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:43.060> cars<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.420> are<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.720> here

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
all the numbers of cars that are in here

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.780 
all the numbers of cars that are in here
so<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:44.739> put<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.040> over<00:03:45.100> there<00:03:45.459> you're

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
so you just put that over there you're

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.580 
so you just put that over there you're
telling<00:03:46.120> them<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.690> either<00:03:46.840> swap<00:03:47.319> or

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
telling them that you can either swap or

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.500 
telling them that you can either swap or
put<00:03:47.799> them<00:03:47.950> down<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:48.880> obviously<00:03:49.299> you're<00:03:49.450> gonna

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
put them down but obviously you're gonna

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.699 
put them down but obviously you're gonna
do<00:03:49.780> an<00:03:49.930> example<00:03:50.350> first<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.130> example<00:03:51.640> is

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
do an example first but the example is

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.920 
do an example first but the example is
where<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:53.799> organized<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.540> result

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
where you organized to get this result

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.780 
where you organized to get this result
so<00:03:56.709> what<00:03:57.040> you're<00:03:57.130> gonna<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.609> you're<00:03:57.700> going

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
so what you're gonna do is you're going

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.009 
so what you're gonna do is you're going
to<00:03:57.850> tell<00:03:58.090> them<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.450> can<00:03:58.600> either<00:03:58.720> place<00:03:58.989> a

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
to tell them that you can either place a

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.449 
to tell them that you can either place a
facedown<00:03:59.739> or<00:04:00.130> swamp<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.060> put<00:04:01.989> ace<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:03.190> two

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
facedown or swamp so put ace then two

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.759 
facedown or swamp so put ace then two
obviously<00:04:04.420> these<00:04:04.750> need<00:04:05.049> to<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.290> down<00:04:05.470> first

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
obviously these need to be down first

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:12.210 
obviously these need to be down first
and<00:04:06.069> then<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:07.480> swap<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.530> 3<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:10.209> 4<00:04:11.220> this

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
and then you swap the 3 and the 4 this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.880 
and then you swap the 3 and the 4 this
gets<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.730> into<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> certain<00:04:13.269> pattern<00:04:14.049> there

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
gets it into a certain pattern there

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.470 
gets it into a certain pattern there
so<00:04:15.430> now<00:04:15.520> what<00:04:15.670> you're<00:04:15.760> going<00:04:15.850> to<00:04:15.910> do<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.329> you're

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
so now what you're going to do is you're

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.300 
so now what you're going to do is you're
also<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:17.019> going<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.200> put<00:04:17.320> down<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.620> five<00:04:17.859> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
also just going to put down the five to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.560 
also just going to put down the five to
them<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.640> think<00:04:18.850> you're<00:04:18.970> putting<00:04:19.390> these<00:04:19.510> down

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
them you think you're putting these down

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.960 
them you think you're putting these down
in<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.140> random<00:04:20.500> order<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:21.519> show<00:04:21.640> them<00:04:21.850> an

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
in a random order just show them an

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.180 
in a random order just show them an
example<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.540> what<00:04:22.660> you're<00:04:22.750> going<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.900> do<00:04:23.190> then

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
example of what you're going to do then

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.900 
example of what you're going to do then
you're<00:04:24.340> going<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.490> switch<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:25.030> 7<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.570> 6

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
you're going to switch the 7 and the 6

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.810 
you're going to switch the 7 and the 6
and<00:04:27.910> then<00:04:28.710> put<00:04:29.710> down<00:04:29.920> 8<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.430> obviously

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
and then put down 8 and obviously

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.640 
and then put down 8 and obviously
because<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.780> tell<00:04:31.960> them<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.140> it's<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.470> last

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
because you tell them that it's the last

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.160 
because you tell them that it's the last
card<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.010> put<00:04:33.160> down<00:04:33.340> 9<00:04:33.550> now<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.570> keep<00:04:34.870> them<00:04:35.080> in

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
card you put down 9 now you keep them in

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.680 
card you put down 9 now you keep them in
this<00:04:35.260> order<00:04:36.030> put<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.210> focus<00:04:37.720> there<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:39.690> you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
this order put that focus there and you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.860 
this order put that focus there and you
do<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.110> once<00:04:41.260> again<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.740> only<00:04:41.860> do<00:04:42.040> partway

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
do it once again but you only do partway

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.810 
do it once again but you only do partway
so<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:43.930> say<00:04:44.380> ok<00:04:44.890> I'm<00:04:44.980> gonna<00:04:45.220> show<00:04:45.340> these<00:04:45.490> I'm

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
so you say ok I'm gonna show these I'm

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.300 
so you say ok I'm gonna show these I'm
sure<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:46.030> show<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.480> again<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.140> ace<00:04:47.410> but

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
sure to show you this again so ace but

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.500 
sure to show you this again so ace but
instead<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.580> doing<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:49.000> down<00:04:49.150> again<00:04:49.360> you're

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
instead of doing it down again you're

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.659 
instead of doing it down again you're
just<00:04:49.540> telling<00:04:49.900> them<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.169> can<00:04:50.320> swap<00:04:50.620> again<00:04:50.890> so

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
just telling them you can swap again so

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.270 
just telling them you can swap again so
now<00:04:51.850> you're<00:04:52.060> swapping<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.890> get<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.130> ace

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
now you're swapping and you get the ace

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.710 
now you're swapping and you get the ace
4<00:04:54.700> &amp;<00:04:54.850> 2<00:04:55.050> which<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:56.410> bottom<00:04:56.650> numbers<00:04:57.720> now

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
4 &amp; 2 which is the bottom numbers now

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.510 
4 &amp; 2 which is the bottom numbers now
what<00:04:58.930> you're<00:04:59.050> gonna<00:04:59.140> do<00:04:59.350> is<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.190> tell<00:05:00.340> them

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
what you're gonna do is you tell them

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.580 
what you're gonna do is you tell them
okay<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:01.360> get<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.540> so<00:05:01.990> now<00:05:02.169> you're<00:05:02.290> gonna<00:05:02.380> take

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
okay you get it so now you're gonna take

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.960 
okay you get it so now you're gonna take
these<00:05:02.770> cards<00:05:03.160> you're<00:05:03.400> gonna<00:05:03.520> put<00:05:03.760> them<00:05:03.820> on<00:05:03.910> the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
these cards you're gonna put them on the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.020 
these cards you're gonna put them on the
bottom<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.480> deck<00:05:05.610> now<00:05:06.610> comes<00:05:06.910> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
bottom of the deck now comes the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.400 
bottom of the deck now comes the
interesting<00:05:07.060> part<00:05:07.510> where<00:05:07.900> they<00:05:07.990> think<00:05:08.290> they

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
interesting part where they think they

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.960 
interesting part where they think they
have<00:05:08.440> full<00:05:08.770> control<00:05:09.100> over<00:05:09.220> what's<00:05:09.610> going<00:05:09.700> on

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
have full control over what's going on

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.210 
have full control over what's going on
but<00:05:10.300> really<00:05:10.330> you've<00:05:10.840> already<00:05:11.080> taken<00:05:11.860> control

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
but really you've already taken control

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.210 
but really you've already taken control
of<00:05:12.550> everything<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.270> goes<00:05:13.390> on<00:05:13.510> in<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:13.720> trick

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
of everything that goes on in this trick

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.900 
of everything that goes on in this trick
what<00:05:15.220> you're<00:05:15.310> gonna<00:05:15.370> do<00:05:15.640> is<00:05:15.760> you're<00:05:15.850> gonna

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.810 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
tell<00:05:16.210> them<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.660> put<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.680> down<00:05:17.830> or<00:05:18.040> swap<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:19.350> down

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
tell them to put it down or swap so down

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.659 
tell them to put it down or swap so down
swap<00:05:22.410> swap<00:05:23.410> really<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.070> doesn't<00:05:24.220> matter<00:05:24.460> which

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
swap swap really it doesn't matter which

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.940 
swap swap really it doesn't matter which
order<00:05:24.820> because<00:05:25.450> I'll<00:05:26.290> show<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.560> this<00:05:26.710> in<00:05:26.890> a

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
order because I'll show you this in a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.390 
order because I'll show you this in a
moment

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
moment

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.320 
moment
down<00:05:28.060> down<00:05:29.940> last<00:05:30.940> one<00:05:31.180> swap<00:05:32.370> as<00:05:33.370> long<00:05:34.000> as<00:05:34.210> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
down down last one swap as long as you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.840 
down down last one swap as long as you
have<00:05:34.570> whatever<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.680> do<00:05:35.860> either<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.610> three

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
have whatever you do either the three

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.870 
have whatever you do either the three
right<00:05:37.810> there<00:05:37.870> is<00:05:38.350> either<00:05:39.190> gonna<00:05:39.310> be<00:05:39.550> on<00:05:39.760> the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
right there is either gonna be on the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.680 
right there is either gonna be on the
top<00:05:40.180> or<00:05:40.479> it's<00:05:40.840> gonna<00:05:40.930> be<00:05:41.110> on<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.290> bottom<00:05:41.610> so

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
top or it's gonna be on the bottom so

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.350 
top or it's gonna be on the bottom so
maybe<00:05:43.690> do<00:05:43.810> this<00:05:43.930> an<00:05:44.080> even<00:05:44.380> amount<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.680> times<00:05:45.360> so

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
maybe do this an even amount of times so

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.020 
maybe do this an even amount of times so
you<00:05:46.510> show<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:46.810> this<00:05:47.020> again<00:05:47.320> down<00:05:47.770> swap<00:05:52.740> down

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
you show you this again down swap down

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.380 
you show you this again down swap down
swap<00:05:55.030> swap<00:05:56.370> down<00:05:57.370> there's<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.669> times<00:05:58.030> down

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
swap swap down there's the times down

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.960 
swap swap down there's the times down
down<00:05:59.140> we've<00:05:59.740> done<00:05:59.890> this<00:06:00.010> two<00:06:00.250> times<00:06:00.520> which<00:06:00.820> is

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
down we've done this two times which is

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.280 
down we've done this two times which is
an<00:06:01.090> even<00:06:01.240> amount<00:06:01.419> of<00:06:01.630> number<00:06:01.810> so<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.080> twos

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
an even amount of number so the twos

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.680 
an even amount of number so the twos
gonna<00:06:02.440> be<00:06:02.650> on<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.830> bottom<00:06:03.000> so<00:06:04.000> let's<00:06:04.330> just<00:06:04.540> do

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
gonna be on the bottom so let's just do

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.600 
gonna be on the bottom so let's just do
this<00:06:04.840> one<00:06:05.320> more<00:06:05.560> time<00:06:05.620> most<00:06:06.070> likely<00:06:06.160> it'll

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
this one more time most likely it'll

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.040 
this one more time most likely it'll
happen<00:06:09.240> yeah<00:06:10.240> that<00:06:10.450> was<00:06:10.540> down<00:06:10.690> it<00:06:10.930> will

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
happen yeah that was down it will

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.570 
happen yeah that was down it will
probably<00:06:11.290> happen<00:06:11.680> more<00:06:12.040> than<00:06:12.070> two<00:06:12.310> times

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
probably happen more than two times

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.040 
probably happen more than two times
because<00:06:12.880> people<00:06:12.970> like<00:06:13.390> to<00:06:13.419> be<00:06:13.540> very<00:06:13.720> thorough

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
because people like to be very thorough

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.680 
because people like to be very thorough
and<00:06:14.440> know<00:06:14.590> that<00:06:14.740> they<00:06:14.919> have<00:06:15.340> done<00:06:15.610> control<00:06:16.510> of

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
and know that they have done control of

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.570 
and know that they have done control of
what's<00:06:16.840> going<00:06:16.990> on<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:17.640> I'm<00:06:18.640> just<00:06:18.790> gonna<00:06:19.110> swap

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
what's going on so I'm just gonna swap

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.480 
what's going on so I'm just gonna swap
down<00:06:21.580> swap<00:06:22.560> right<00:06:23.560> there<00:06:23.710> like<00:06:23.860> that<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.340> then

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
down swap right there like that and then

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.670 
down swap right there like that and then
you<00:06:24.580> say<00:06:24.760> okay<00:06:25.180> is<00:06:25.450> this<00:06:25.810> good<00:06:26.020> enough<00:06:26.110> and<00:06:26.530> if

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
you say okay is this good enough and if

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.180 
you say okay is this good enough and if
they<00:06:26.800> say<00:06:26.979> yeah<00:06:27.250> cuz<00:06:27.669> yours

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
they say yeah cuz yours

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.100 
they say yeah cuz yours
people<00:06:28.490> won't<00:06:28.610> want<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:28.970> drag<00:06:29.660> it<00:06:29.810> out<00:06:29.870> they'll

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
people won't want to drag it out they'll

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.100 
people won't want to drag it out they'll
want<00:06:30.290> to<00:06:30.350> see<00:06:30.500> what<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.680> trick<00:06:30.890> is<00:06:30.920> so<00:06:32.110> we've

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
want to see what the trick is so we've

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.370 
want to see what the trick is so we've
done<00:06:33.320> it<00:06:33.470> both<00:06:34.190> three<00:06:34.580> times<00:06:34.790> now<00:06:35.000> so<00:06:35.930> what

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
done it both three times now so what

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.230 
done it both three times now so what
happens<00:06:36.740> with<00:06:36.890> that<00:06:36.920> is<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.790> because<00:06:37.910> it's

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
happens with that is that because it's

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.510 
happens with that is that because it's
odd<00:06:39.110> numbers<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.710> three<00:06:39.920> is<00:06:40.010> on<00:06:40.130> the<00:06:40.160> bottom

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520

so what you're gonna do he's going like
that<00:06:44.360> if<00:06:44.660> you<00:06:44.780> don't<00:06:44.900> want<00:06:45.080> to<00:06:45.140> keep<00:06:45.290> track<00:06:45.530> of

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
that if you don't want to keep track of

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.100 
that if you don't want to keep track of
how<00:06:45.860> many<00:06:45.920> you<00:06:46.490> can<00:06:46.640> try<00:06:46.850> to<00:06:46.910> sneak<00:06:47.690> a<00:06:47.780> peek<00:06:47.810> up

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
how many you can try to sneak a peek up

the<00:06:48.230> bottom<00:06:48.530> card<00:06:49.030> before<00:06:50.030> you<00:06:50.120> actually<00:06:50.240> do

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
the bottom card before you actually do

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.180 
the bottom card before you actually do
the<00:06:50.540> trick<00:06:50.840> because<00:06:51.500> the<00:06:51.830> threes<00:06:52.010> on<00:06:52.160> the

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
the trick because the threes on the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.840 
the trick because the threes on the
bottom<00:06:52.490> you<00:06:52.610> start<00:06:52.880> with<00:06:53.000> this<00:06:53.150> so<00:06:54.140> then<00:06:54.350> you

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
bottom you start with this so then you

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.220

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
show them three five seven six eight

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:07.150 
show them three five seven six eight
nine<00:07:01.930> one<00:07:02.930> four<00:07:03.680> two<00:07:05.710> let's<00:07:06.710> see<00:07:06.830> right<00:07:06.860> there

things<00:07:10.790> when<00:07:11.510> you<00:07:11.630> give<00:07:11.810> them<00:07:11.960> the<00:07:12.110> example

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
things when you give them the example

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.920 
things when you give them the example
it's<00:07:12.950> important<00:07:13.460> that<00:07:13.490> you<00:07:13.820> flip<00:07:14.210> and<00:07:14.420> put

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
down in the right order because if you

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.830 
down in the right order because if you
do<00:07:18.380> that<00:07:18.790> then<00:07:19.790> the<00:07:19.970> card<00:07:20.240> in<00:07:20.420> the<00:07:20.510> three<00:07:20.810> and

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
the two and everything in between will

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.640 
the two and everything in between will
be<00:07:23.300> in<00:07:23.510> the<00:07:23.600> right<00:07:23.690> order<00:07:24.050> and<00:07:26.290> that's<00:07:27.290> it<00:07:27.470> for
