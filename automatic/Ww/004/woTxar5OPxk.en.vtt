00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
and that was it oh yeah oh he didn't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.500 
and that was it oh yeah oh he didn't
stay<00:03:19.100> for<00:03:19.160> another<00:03:19.430> match<00:03:19.700> because<00:03:19.910> he'd

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
stay for another match because he'd

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.390 
stay for another match because he'd
usually<00:03:20.690> used<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.290> me<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:21.709> he's<00:03:21.920> not<00:03:22.070> in<00:03:22.130> use

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
usually used to me but he's not in use

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.099 
usually used to me but he's not in use
them<00:03:22.609> though<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.940> used<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.359> my<00:03:23.450> new<00:03:23.480> play<00:03:23.780> style

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
them though I used to my new play style

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.660 
them though I used to my new play style
