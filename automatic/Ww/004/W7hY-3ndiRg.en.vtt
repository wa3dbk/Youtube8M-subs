00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
style of construction because it makes

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.580 
style of construction because it makes
the<00:02:47.970> lining<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.630> smooth<00:02:48.959> against<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.380> body

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
channels which I really like because it

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.150 
channels which I really like because it

the<00:03:10.620> bones<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.790> voting<00:03:12.150> channels<00:03:12.480> are<00:03:12.569> also

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the bones the voting channels are also

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.860 
the bones the voting channels are also
covered<00:03:13.290> with<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.100> same<00:03:14.340> raw<00:03:14.760> silk<00:03:15.150> I'm<00:03:15.540> not

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
covered with the same raw silk I'm not

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.569 
covered with the same raw silk I'm not
sure<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.290> credited<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.130> silhouette

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
sure if it's credited to the silhouette

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.059 
sure if it's credited to the silhouette
of<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.819> corset<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:18.959> cut<00:03:19.290> or<00:03:19.590> if

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
of this corset the way it's cut or if

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.319 
of this corset the way it's cut or if
it's<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> raw<00:03:21.030> silk

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
it's just the way that the raw silk

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.120 
it's just the way that the raw silk
behaves<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:22.380> you'll<00:03:22.530> notice<00:03:22.799> at<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
behaves but you'll notice at the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.160 
behaves but you'll notice at the
beginning<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.819> video<00:03:24.030> when<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> had<00:03:25.049> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
beginning of this video when I had the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.470 
beginning of this video when I had the
corset<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.980> was<00:03:26.130> modeling<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.299> are

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
corset on I was modeling it there are

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.930 
corset on I was modeling it there are
very<00:03:27.510> very<00:03:27.900> few<00:03:28.349> wrinkles<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.459> corset

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
very very few wrinkles in this corset

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.520 
very very few wrinkles in this corset
and<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.180> really<00:03:30.569> like<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and I really like that it's just a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.550 
and I really like that it's just a
really<00:03:31.859> smooth<00:03:32.340> line<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:33.780> via<00:03:34.079> corset

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
really smooth line so this via corset

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.440 
really smooth line so this via corset
has<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> most<00:03:35.040> bones<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.430> any<00:03:35.579> other<00:03:35.819> overbust

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
corset by what Katie Did you can see

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.020 
corset by what Katie Did you can see
it's<00:03:38.790> double<00:03:39.180> bond<00:03:39.419> on<00:03:39.750> each<00:03:39.989> seam<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.880> is

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
it's double bond on each seam so this is

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.690 
it's double bond on each seam so this is

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.800 
be three quarters of an inch wide I
think<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:48.460> pretty<00:04:48.700> unique<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.300> what<00:04:49.630> Kay

any other brand of corsets I really like

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.190 
any other brand of corsets I really like
the<00:04:54.040> fact<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.370> they<00:04:54.670> use<00:04:54.850> 3/4<00:04:55.420> inch<00:04:55.600> wide<00:04:55.720> bus

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
the fact that they use 3/4 inch wide bus

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.230 
the fact that they use 3/4 inch wide bus
instead<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.220> standard<00:04:57.430> half<00:04:57.850> inch<00:04:58.060> wide

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
instead of the standard half inch wide

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.790 
instead of the standard half inch wide
bus<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:58.720> see<00:04:58.960> in<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.320> lot<00:04:59.350> of<00:04:59.560> other

bus that you see in a lot of other
off-the-rack<00:05:00.700> corsets<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:02.200> can<00:05:02.350> expect<00:05:02.740> it

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
off-the-rack corsets you can expect it

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.680 
off-the-rack corsets you can expect it
to<00:05:03.010> be<00:05:03.160> slightly<00:05:03.520> sturdier<00:05:04.060> than<00:05:04.120> those<00:05:04.450> half

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
to be slightly sturdier than those half

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.920 
to be slightly sturdier than those half
inch<00:05:04.900> wide<00:05:05.080> busks<00:05:05.790> in<00:05:06.790> terms<00:05:07.330> of<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.570> grommets

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
inch wide busks in terms of the grommets

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.070 
inch wide busks in terms of the grommets
they<00:05:08.080> use<00:05:08.290> there<00:05:08.620> are<00:05:08.650> 24<00:05:09.460> size<00:05:09.850> zero<00:05:10.450> grommets

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
they use there are 24 size zero grommets

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.470 
they use there are 24 size zero grommets
so<00:05:11.380> 12<00:05:11.770> on<00:05:12.010> each<00:05:12.220> side<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.850> as<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.420> see

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
so 12 on each side and as you can see

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.120 
so 12 on each side and as you can see
