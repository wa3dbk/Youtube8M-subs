00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.850
 our god is restorative and always 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.050
 It rewards us when we look for it

 heart the Lord will not only restore us 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.810
 the badly invested resources but that we 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 will give much more than that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.570
 verse 9 says but macías said to him 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.210
 to the man of god and what will happen to 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.650
 the three thousand three hundred kilos of silver 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.739
 that I paid the Israeli army and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.650
 the man of god replied the lord 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.940
 can give his majesty much more than 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.030
 that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.720
 to macías was a king of playing that counted 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.080
 with a great army but to face 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.809
 an enemy decided to hire others 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.560
 soldiers that god did not approve to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.080
 back was warned by a male of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 God that did not send to that other army 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.010
 for which I had invested a lot 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.159
 Macías asked him what would happen to his 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.420
 bad investment and the male of God will 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.690
 responded God can give you much more than 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 that 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.780
 the lord does not take into account the size of 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.830
 our bad decisions or the effort 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.080
 that we have badly invested or things in 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.170
 we put hope and did not give 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 result because either bad money 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.020
 Invested effort in vain or any 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 another type of losses for bad 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.720
 decisions 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.380
 we will be restored the Lord calls us to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.050
 trust and obey him first but 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.320
 the time comes where not only do you 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.340
 also much more than that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.120
