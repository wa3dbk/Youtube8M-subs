I've<00:00:17.039> always<00:00:17.220> liked<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.880> armymen<00:00:18.630> concept

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260

take the popular plastic toys put them

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.349 
take the popular plastic toys put them
in<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> slightly<00:00:22.350> cartoony<00:00:23.189> war<00:00:23.460> zone<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
in a slightly cartoony war zone it's a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
in a slightly cartoony war zone it's a
fun<00:00:24.570> idea<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.590> continues<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
fun idea this one continues the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.300 
fun idea this one continues the
tradition<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.240> excellent<00:00:27.660> game<00:00:27.990> of

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
tradition it's an excellent game of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
tradition it's an excellent game of
surprisingly<00:00:29.310> tactical<00:00:30.000> game<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.750> army<00:00:31.349> men

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
surprisingly tactical game it's army men

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.510 

so<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.080> was<00:00:42.230> one<00:00:42.380> of<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.560> earliest<00:00:42.950> games<00:00:43.280> in

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
so this was one of the earliest games in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.400 
so this was one of the earliest games in
the<00:00:43.640> Army<00:00:43.970> Men<00:00:44.120> series<00:00:44.450> it<00:00:44.810> was<00:00:44.900> released<00:00:45.200> back

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the Army Men series it was released back

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.240

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and Game Boy Color which is obviously

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320 
and Game Boy Color which is obviously
the<00:00:52.040> one<00:00:52.220> we're<00:00:52.400> playing<00:00:52.430> here<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.270> about

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
the one we're playing here it's about

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.150 
the one we're playing here it's about
the<00:00:53.540> same<00:00:53.720> concept<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.440> previous<00:00:54.920> games

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
the same concept as the previous games

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.210 
the same concept as the previous games
only<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.850> time<00:00:56.180> you're<00:00:56.630> in<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.810> helicopter

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
only this time you're in a helicopter

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.550 
only this time you're in a helicopter
which<00:00:58.220> may<00:00:59.030> or<00:00:59.150> may<00:00:59.330> not<00:00:59.360> be<00:00:59.750> made<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> plastic

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
which may or may not be made of plastic

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.230 
which may or may not be made of plastic
and<00:01:00.920> actually<00:01:01.550> if<00:01:01.670> you're<00:01:01.790> familiar<00:01:01.970> with

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
and actually if you're familiar with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.450 
and actually if you're familiar with
games<00:01:02.600> like<00:01:02.720> desert<00:01:03.230> strike<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.800> mean<00:01:04.130> this<00:01:04.309> is

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
games like desert strike I mean this is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.340 
games like desert strike I mean this is
basically<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.030> same<00:01:05.210> thing<00:01:05.270> each<00:01:05.930> level

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
basically the same thing each level

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.240 
basically the same thing each level
gives<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.830> mission

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
gives you a mission

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.520 
gives you a mission
anything<00:01:08.120> from<00:01:08.270> carry<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.840> supplies<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.230> your

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
anything from carry the supplies to your

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.490 
anything from carry the supplies to your
base<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.300> destroy<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.510> enemy<00:01:11.810> vehicles<00:01:11.960> and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
base to destroy the enemy vehicles and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.640 
base to destroy the enemy vehicles and
from<00:01:12.860> there<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:13.400> air-to-ground<00:01:14.360> combat<00:01:15.260> and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
from there it's air-to-ground combat and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.980 
from there it's air-to-ground combat and
the<00:01:15.740> game<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:15.979> heavily<00:01:16.370> strategy<00:01:17.150> based<00:01:17.390> -<00:01:17.660> so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the game is heavily strategy based - so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the game is heavily strategy based - so
all<00:01:18.410> out<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:19.010> salts<00:01:19.400> won't<00:01:19.580> get<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:19.850> very<00:01:19.880> far

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.280 

see<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.850> gaming<00:01:31.150> kind<00:01:31.480> of<00:01:31.570> forces<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.140> to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
see the gaming kind of forces you to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.200 
see the gaming kind of forces you to
play<00:01:32.590> carefully<00:01:32.860> both<00:01:33.490> due<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.910> nature<00:01:34.180> of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
play carefully both due to the nature of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.110 
play carefully both due to the nature of
its<00:01:34.360> design<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.800> few<00:01:35.950> flaws<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.490> has<00:01:36.640> with

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
its design and the few flaws it has with

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.030 
its design and the few flaws it has with
the<00:01:37.150> enemy's<00:01:37.540> overwhelm<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.470> at<00:01:38.590> times

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
the enemy's overwhelm you at times

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.970 
the enemy's overwhelm you at times
tanks<00:01:39.640> soldiers<00:01:40.450> towers<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.440> they<00:01:41.680> all<00:01:41.800> seem

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
tanks soldiers towers and they all seem

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.910 
tanks soldiers towers and they all seem
to<00:01:42.070> have<00:01:42.160> impeccable<00:01:42.850> aim<00:01:43.300> flying<00:01:44.230> into<00:01:44.560> enemy

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
to have impeccable aim flying into enemy

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.860 
to have impeccable aim flying into enemy
territory<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.910> dangerous<00:01:46.600> proposition

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
territory is a dangerous proposition

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.070 
territory is a dangerous proposition
unless<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.980> have<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.160> plan<00:01:48.490> which<00:01:49.300> I<00:01:49.420> rarely<00:01:49.720> do

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
unless you have a plan which I rarely do

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.680 
unless you have a plan which I rarely do
so<00:01:50.950> yeah<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.490> have<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.790> be<00:01:51.940> smart<00:01:52.480> about<00:01:52.570> your

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
so yeah you have to be smart about your

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.840 
so yeah you have to be smart about your
approach<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.860> game<00:01:54.010> has<00:01:54.160> flaws<00:01:54.520> have

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
approach but the game has flaws have

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.790 
approach but the game has flaws have
something<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.390> with<00:01:55.480> that<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.930> see<00:01:56.470> its

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
something to do with that to see its

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.320 
something to do with that to see its
controls<00:01:57.280> actually<00:01:57.700> aren't<00:01:58.150> all<00:01:58.300> that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
controls actually aren't all that

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.390 
controls actually aren't all that
different<00:01:58.870> from<00:01:58.900> an<00:01:59.140> old<00:01:59.290> Resident<00:01:59.830> Evil<00:02:00.160> game

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
different from an old Resident Evil game

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.160 
different from an old Resident Evil game
but<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:00.940> know<00:02:01.030> how<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.180> works<00:02:01.390> left<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> right

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
but you know how it works left and right

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.710 
but you know how it works left and right
on<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> d-pad<00:02:02.620> just<00:02:03.430> steer<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.090> chopper<00:02:04.510> up

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
on the d-pad just steer the chopper up

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.780 
on the d-pad just steer the chopper up
moves<00:02:05.350> forward<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.100> kind<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.430> thing

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
moves forward that kind of thing

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.250 
moves forward that kind of thing
whether<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.360> those<00:02:07.540> controls<00:02:07.990> are<00:02:08.110> not

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
whether you like those controls are not

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.470 
whether you like those controls are not
they<00:02:08.920> certainly<00:02:09.190> make<00:02:09.430> your<00:02:09.610> movements<00:02:10.090> more

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
they certainly make your movements more

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.720 
they certainly make your movements more
deliberate<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.890> they<00:02:12.010> make<00:02:12.190> picking<00:02:12.550> things

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
deliberate and they make picking things

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.050 
deliberate and they make picking things
up<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.090> nightmare

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.420 

but<00:02:20.750> that's<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.080> thing<00:02:21.290> about<00:02:21.319> aerial<00:02:21.950> combat

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
but that's the thing about aerial combat

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
but that's the thing about aerial combat
this<00:02:22.610> game<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:23.000> legitimately<00:02:23.900> challenging

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
this game is legitimately challenging

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.710 
this game is legitimately challenging
where<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.099> characters<00:02:25.520> may<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.790> toys<00:02:26.239> but

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
