a minecraft so I'm not gonna record and
a<00:01:37.799> gameplay<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.280> gonna<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.549> another<00:01:38.820> test

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a gameplay I'm gonna do another test

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
a gameplay I'm gonna do another test
later<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.590> doesn't<00:01:40.979> work<00:01:41.100> pretty

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
later on and it doesn't work pretty

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
later on and it doesn't work pretty
smooth<00:01:41.640> frame<00:01:42.180> rate<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.570> he<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.840> crashes

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
smooth frame rate that he just crashes

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
smooth frame rate that he just crashes
with<00:01:43.619> micros<00:01:43.950> minecraft<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.030> i'm<00:01:45.149> guessing<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
with micros minecraft so i'm guessing to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
with micros minecraft so i'm guessing to
some<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> conflict<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.250> java<00:01:47.579> de<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
some kind of conflict with java de so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
some kind of conflict with java de so

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
watch this video on to figure out then

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.359 
watch this video on to figure out then
but<00:01:55.140> yeah<00:01:55.259> over<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> night<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> seems<00:01:56.130> pretty

cool game a game a pretty cool piece of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.649 
cool game a game a pretty cool piece of
software<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.570> nice<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.229> sleek<00:02:01.530> looking<00:02:01.920> new

frame<00:02:03.659> rate<00:02:03.869> we're<00:02:04.020> dicen<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.619> two-headed

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
frame rate we're dicen is two-headed

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
frame rate we're dicen is two-headed
balance<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.729> didn't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.360> open<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:06.840> like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
balance they didn't want open down like

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
balance they didn't want open down like
fuck<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> didn't<00:02:08.099> say<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.550> too

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
fuck you and it didn't say we use up too

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.340 
fuck you and it didn't say we use up too
much<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> professor<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
much of the professor and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.070 
much of the professor and
and<00:02:11.090> apparently<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.360> uses<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> cars

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and apparently it uses all the cars

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.230 
and apparently it uses all the cars
which<00:02:13.350> fraps<00:02:13.980> doesn't<00:02:14.460> do<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.790> only<00:02:14.910> uses<00:02:15.120> one

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
which fraps doesn't do it only uses one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.540 
which fraps doesn't do it only uses one
core<00:02:15.660> or<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.990> used<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.760> whereas<00:02:19.550> dxtory

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
core or it used to do whereas dxtory

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.450 
core or it used to do whereas dxtory
uses<00:02:20.820> all<00:02:20.940> four<00:02:21.180> cars<00:02:21.450> as<00:02:21.600> well<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
uses all four cars as well so as you can

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.020 
uses all four cars as well so as you can
see<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.410> first<00:02:25.680> video<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.250> did<00:02:26.280> was<00:02:26.490> 68

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
see the first video that we did was 68

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.580 
see the first video that we did was 68
megabyte<00:02:27.480> which<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.780> pretty<00:02:28.020> good<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.380> or<00:02:28.560> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
megabyte which is pretty good it or a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
megabyte which is pretty good it or a
lot<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> minute<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> half<00:02:29.190> long<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.240> it's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
lot a minute and a half long so it's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
lot a minute and a half long so it's
better<00:02:30.660> than<00:02:30.810> night<00:02:30.990> free<00:02:31.350> gigabyte<00:02:31.800> which

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
better than night free gigabyte which

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.650 
better than night free gigabyte which
fraps<00:02:32.340> usually<00:02:32.700> does<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> I'll<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.480> we

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
fraps usually does it I'll get like we

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.700 
fraps usually does it I'll get like we
called<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:33.930> desk<00:02:34.050> up<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.410> get<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> free

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
called my desk up and get a free

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.980 
called my desk up and get a free
gigabyte<00:02:35.160> file<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.330> pretty<00:02:36.570> cool<00:02:36.690> it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
gigabyte file so that's pretty cool it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.450 
gigabyte file so that's pretty cool it
keeps<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.320> files<00:02:37.530> down<00:02:37.800> when<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.130> knows<00:02:38.280> like

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
keeps you files down when it knows like

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.040 
keeps you files down when it knows like
it's<00:02:38.610> recording<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> screen<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.780> in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's recording the screen and not in

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's recording the screen and not in
game<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.130> yeah<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.490> seems<00:02:41.670> pretty<00:02:41.910> cool

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
game so yeah that seems pretty cool

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.220 
game so yeah that seems pretty cool
overall<00:02:42.450> pretty<00:02:42.630> cool<00:02:42.930> piece<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.110> software

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
overall pretty cool piece of software

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.440 
overall pretty cool piece of software
