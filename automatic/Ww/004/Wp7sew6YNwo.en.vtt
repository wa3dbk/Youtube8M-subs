00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.069
 we want but do not do it to the karama 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.870
 we found without downloading 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.420
 only at your minimum we go to the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.500
 version 1.7 points and we get to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 any three screws 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.240
 we arrived in one and downloaded it 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.870
 once downloaded there will only be one 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.790
 ZIP file 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.480
 and now what we are going to do is our 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.170
 binder 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.470
 we open execute and write % app data 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.980
 finally 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.620
 let's go to minecraft version and now 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.260

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.110
 right copy and we paste it right in the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.550
 same folder now the folder that we have 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.840

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.540
 let's name whatever we want 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.970
 ok but very important that we 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.620
 let's stay with this name if so that 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.840
 have no difficulty as well 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.230
 name it too many 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.150
 and before accepting we copied the name and 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.490
 is now open the folder to 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.320
 benitez and what we are going to do is 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.900
 change the name to these two files 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.520

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.520
 notes 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.700
