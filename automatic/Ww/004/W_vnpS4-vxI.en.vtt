to<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> rave<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.700> point<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.860> map<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.100> very

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
to a rave at this point this map is very

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
to a rave at this point this map is very
very<00:00:47.670> tricky<00:00:48.090> since<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.750> space<00:00:49.379> around<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
very tricky since the space around the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850 
very tricky since the space around the
bases<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.000> large<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.719> put<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> proxy

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
bases are so large you can put a proxy

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
bases are so large you can put a proxy
anywhere<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> hide<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.910> own<00:00:54.090> buildings

think about taking his lurker group and

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.220 
think about taking his lurker group and
using<00:06:05.580> those<00:06:05.730> as<00:06:06.000> kind<00:06:06.540> of<00:06:06.600> an<00:06:06.750> aggressive

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
using those as kind of an aggressive

using those as kind of an aggressive

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
push when he's attacking the Rays

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.110 
push when he's attacking the Rays
because<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.070> Rays<00:06:11.250> will<00:06:11.430> have<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:11.700> focus<00:06:11.880> on

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
because the Rays will have to focus on

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.840 
because the Rays will have to focus on
the<00:06:12.210> medalist<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:13.140> not<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.250> lurkers<00:06:14.610> and

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
the medalist and not the lurkers and

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.010 
the medalist and not the lurkers and
lurkers<00:06:15.180> would<00:06:15.300> probably<00:06:15.570> be<00:06:15.660> able<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.900> wipe

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020
