00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
way in to that inner corner now I'm

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.660 
way in to that inner corner now I'm
taking<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:52.990> shade<00:01:53.170> fine<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.800> sigma<00:01:54.190> e45

taking the shade fine on a sigma e45
brush<00:01:54.820> this<00:01:55.420> brush<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.900> perfect<00:01:56.440> for<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.650> look

brush this brush is perfect for a look

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.380 
brush this brush is perfect for a look
like<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:57.130> because<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> nice<00:01:57.880> taper<00:01:58.210> to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
like this because it's a nice taper to

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.180 
like this because it's a nice taper to
blending<00:01:58.750> brush<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.470> I'm<00:01:59.590> applying<00:01:59.800> this<00:02:00.040> to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
blending brush so I'm applying this to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.490 
blending brush so I'm applying this to
the<00:02:00.220> very<00:02:00.520> outer<00:02:00.850> corner<00:02:01.420> first<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.290> also

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
the very outer corner first and I also

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.859 
the very outer corner first and I also
apply<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:02.979> into<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.460> very<00:02:03.759> inner<00:02:04.030> corner<00:02:04.479> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
apply it into the very inner corner and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.180 
apply it into the very inner corner and
just<00:02:05.110> bring<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.290> up<00:02:05.530> into<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.950> crease<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
just bring that up into the crease a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.130 
just bring that up into the crease a
little<00:02:06.700> bit<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.060> there<00:02:07.210> isn't<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.540> disconnect

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
little bit so there isn't a disconnect

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.590 
little bit so there isn't a disconnect
but<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.619> am<00:02:08.890> keeping<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.459> ball<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.910> my<00:02:10.060> eye<00:02:10.090> bare

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
but I am keeping the ball of my eye bare

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.510 
but I am keeping the ball of my eye bare
because<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.080> are<00:02:11.230> gonna<00:02:11.380> apply<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.770> pop<00:02:12.310> of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
because we are gonna apply that pop of

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.350 
because we are gonna apply that pop of
color<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.300> minute

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.570 

I'm<00:02:21.020> going<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.470> with<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.680> clean<00:02:21.800> blending<00:02:22.520> brush

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
I'm going in with a clean blending brush

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.340 
I'm going in with a clean blending brush
and<00:02:22.790> I'm<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.330> around<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> very<00:02:24.020> outer

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
and I'm just going around the very outer

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.950 
and I'm just going around the very outer
perimeter<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.460> fine<00:02:25.760> color<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:26.840> we

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
perimeter of that fine color just so we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.450 
perimeter of that fine color just so we
don't<00:02:26.990> have<00:02:27.230> any<00:02:27.470> harsh<00:02:27.800> lines<00:02:28.070> or<00:02:28.280> any

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
don't have any harsh lines or any

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.360 
don't have any harsh lines or any
choppiness<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> lot<00:02:31.190> of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
choppiness this I like is a lot of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.070 
choppiness this I like is a lot of
applying<00:02:31.880> color<00:02:32.120> blending<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> out<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.990> then

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
applying color blending it out and then

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.540 
applying color blending it out and then
applying<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:33.710> bit<00:02:33.830> more<00:02:34.070> until<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.400> get

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
applying a little bit more until you get

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.310 
applying a little bit more until you get
the<00:02:34.670> intensity<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.300> want<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.110> did

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
the intensity that you want so I did

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.380 
the intensity that you want so I did
pick<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.770> same<00:02:37.040> shade<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.880> little<00:02:38.240> bit

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
pick up that same shade on a little bit

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
pick up that same shade on a little bit
smaller<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:39.110> precise<00:02:39.440> brush<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.160> just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
smaller more precise brush this is just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.040 
smaller more precise brush this is just
one<00:02:40.580> from<00:02:40.850> one<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.240> Urban<00:02:41.540> Decay<00:02:41.630> palette

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
one from one of the Urban Decay palette

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.320 
one from one of the Urban Decay palette
and<00:02:42.740> I'm<00:02:42.860> applying<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.370> right<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> very

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and I'm applying that right on the very

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.390 
and I'm applying that right on the very
outer<00:02:44.600> part<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.230> my<00:02:45.290> eye<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.010> then<00:02:46.130> right<00:02:46.370> on

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
outer part of my eye and then right on

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.520 
outer part of my eye and then right on
the<00:02:46.640> very<00:02:46.940> inner<00:02:47.209> corner<00:02:47.600> now<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.350> time<00:02:48.500> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the very inner corner now it's time to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
the very inner corner now it's time to
go<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.310> apply<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.670> highlight<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
go in and apply that highlight in the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.480 
go in and apply that highlight in the
center<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.990> our<00:02:51.200> eye<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.250> picked

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
center of our eye and for that I picked

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.220 
center of our eye and for that I picked
up<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.730> shade<00:02:52.910> firm<00:02:53.270> it's<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> beautiful

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
up the shade firm it's a beautiful

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.750 
up the shade firm it's a beautiful
bronzy<00:02:54.709> shade<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.310> really<00:02:55.520> going<00:02:55.700> to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
bronzy shade and it's really going to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.060 
bronzy shade and it's really going to
make<00:02:55.850> our<00:02:56.030> eyes<00:02:56.150> pop<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.440> use<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> flat

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
make our eyes pop so I just use a flat

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.530 
make our eyes pop so I just use a flat
shader<00:02:58.430> brush<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.700> I'm<00:02:58.910> applying<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.360> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
shader brush and I'm applying this to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.330 
shader brush and I'm applying this to
the<00:02:59.570> very<00:02:59.840> center<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.320> my<00:03:00.620> eye<00:03:00.650> where<00:03:01.070> we<00:03:01.220> have

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
the very center of my eye where we have

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.300 
the very center of my eye where we have
left<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.670> there<00:03:01.790> before<00:03:02.500> now<00:03:03.500> using<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.980> very

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
left it there before now using a very

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.520 
left it there before now using a very
light<00:03:04.610> hand<00:03:04.820> I'm<00:03:05.030> using<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.420> same<00:03:05.660> Sigma<00:03:05.989> e45

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
light hand I'm using that same Sigma e45

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.350 
light hand I'm using that same Sigma e45
brush<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.670> bit<00:03:07.820> more<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.209> that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
brush with a little bit more of that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540 
brush with a little bit more of that
firm<00:03:08.660> shade<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.170> applying<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.340> very

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
firm shade and applying that on the very

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.460 
firm shade and applying that on the very
outer<00:03:10.760> corners<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.390> bringing<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.110> into

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
outer corners and bringing that up into

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.260 
outer corners and bringing that up into
the<00:03:12.560> crease<00:03:12.770> again<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.520> because<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.880> lost<00:03:14.090> a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
the crease again just because I lost a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.210 
the crease again just because I lost a
little<00:03:14.450> bit<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> intensity<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.770> now<00:03:16.070> I'm

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
little bit of the intensity and now I'm
