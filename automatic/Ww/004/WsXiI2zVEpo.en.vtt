realistic expectations and that they're

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.420 
realistic expectations and that they're
not<00:03:43.079> trying<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.320> sell<00:03:43.530> 10,000<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.310> these<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
not trying to sell 10,000 of these a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.069 
not trying to sell 10,000 of these a
year<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.940> want<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.359> try<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.570> sell<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> couple

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
thousand a year so I think it's more of

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.160 
thousand a year so I think it's more of
a<00:03:48.510> brand<00:03:48.900> elevator<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.190> halo<00:03:50.370> car<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
a brand elevator kind of a halo car and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.539 
a brand elevator kind of a halo car and
if<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.500> truly<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.280> their<00:03:53.790> objective<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.540> if

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
if that truly is their objective and if

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.059 
if that truly is their objective and if
you<00:03:56.549> know<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.150> brand<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.870> accept

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
you know the brand can accept

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.849 
you know the brand can accept
except<00:03:59.879> that<00:03:59.939> to<00:04:00.390> only<00:04:00.689> sell<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:00.989> thousand<00:04:01.680> or

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
except that to only sell a thousand or

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.800 
except that to only sell a thousand or
two<00:04:02.159> thousand<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.670> these<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.420> think<00:04:03.629> we're

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
two thousand of these then I think we're

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.020 
two thousand of these then I think we're
