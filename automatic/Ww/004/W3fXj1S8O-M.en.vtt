exploration that i did through a couple
of<00:00:06.810> fantasy<00:00:07.259> weapons<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.250> made<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.849> like

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of fantasy weapons that I I made I like

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.600 
of fantasy weapons that I I made I like
doing<00:00:09.420> these<00:00:09.660> once<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.200> while<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.679> it's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
doing these once in a while it's it's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.400 
doing these once in a while it's it's
kind<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.940> more<00:00:12.389> fun<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.900> me<00:00:12.960> than<00:00:13.200> drawing

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
kind of more fun for me than drawing

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.039 
kind of more fun for me than drawing
monsters<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.370> i'm<00:00:14.880> getting<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.420> newfound

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
monsters really i'm getting a newfound

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.830 
monsters really i'm getting a newfound
passion<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.520> drawing<00:00:17.640> weapons<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.570> they

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
passion for drawing weapons because they

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
passion for drawing weapons because they
with<00:00:19.560> fantasy<00:00:19.949> weapons<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> idea<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.029> make

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
with fantasy weapons the idea is to make

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.599 
with fantasy weapons the idea is to make
them<00:00:21.330> look<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.630> cool<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> interesting<00:00:23.010> as

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
them look as cool and interesting as

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
them look as cool and interesting as
possible<00:00:24.119> rather<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.619> make<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.800> as

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
possible rather than make them as

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
possible rather than make them as
practical<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.670> possible<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.420> practicality

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
practical as possible with practicality

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
practical as possible with practicality
usually<00:00:28.800> simplicity<00:00:29.699> works<00:00:29.849> best<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.510> in

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
usually simplicity works best but in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
usually simplicity works best but in
this<00:00:30.720> particular<00:00:30.960> case<00:00:32.450> they<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.570> far<00:00:33.840> from

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this particular case they are far from

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.190 
this particular case they are far from
simple<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.800> far<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.219> practical<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.120> hey<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
simple and far from practical so hey it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
simple and far from practical so hey it
works<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.879> I've<00:00:38.969> been<00:00:39.059> doing<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.329> lot<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
works out so I've been doing a lot of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
works out so I've been doing a lot of
reading<00:00:39.870> lately<00:00:40.050> regarding<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> art

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

plain<00:00:52.289> stuff<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.739> scratch<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.309> upon<00:00:53.610> doing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
plain stuff from scratch but upon doing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.080 
plain stuff from scratch but upon doing
some<00:00:54.180> reading<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.960> some<00:00:55.890> 3d<00:00:56.340> forums<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
some reading on some 3d forums and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
some reading on some 3d forums and
concept<00:00:57.510> art<00:00:57.660> forms<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.199> discovered<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
concept art forms I discovered that they

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.349 
concept art forms I discovered that they
actually<00:00:59.309> employ<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.000> 3d<00:01:00.300> modeling<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
actually employ a lot of 3d modeling and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually employ a lot of 3d modeling and
texture<00:01:03.359> mapping<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.989> their<00:01:04.220> their<00:01:05.220> weapons

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
texture mapping for their their weapons

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
texture mapping for their their weapons
and<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> their<00:01:06.830> banners<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> they

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and even some of their banners that they

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
and even some of their banners that they
put<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.610> each<00:01:08.820> expansion<00:01:09.270> comes<00:01:09.600> out

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
put out when each expansion comes out

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
put out when each expansion comes out
you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.200> they're<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.070> low-poly<00:01:11.520> style

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you know they're the low-poly style

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
you know they're the low-poly style
stuff<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.369> looks<00:01:14.369> very

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
stuff that they have which is looks very

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
stuff that they have which is looks very
cartoony<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.530> ridiculously<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.009> just

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
cartoony but not ridiculously so it just

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.420 
cartoony but not ridiculously so it just
looks<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.759> cool<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.009> models

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
looks really cool so they do the models

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
looks really cool so they do the models
in<00:01:20.640> ZBrush<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.869> apply<00:01:22.110> textures

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
in ZBrush and then they apply textures

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
in ZBrush and then they apply textures
to<00:01:22.890> something<00:01:23.220> called<00:01:23.340> deep<00:01:23.670> paint<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.299> there

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to something called deep paint or there

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.999 
to something called deep paint or there
are<00:01:24.689> some<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.049> programs<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.590> I've<00:01:25.770> never

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
are some other programs that I've never

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340 
are some other programs that I've never
worked<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> life<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.990> trying<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
worked with in my life but I'm trying to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
worked with in my life but I'm trying to
emulate<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.890> style<00:01:29.220> sort<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
emulate that style sort of and get to a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
emulate that style sort of and get to a
point<00:01:30.900> where<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.200> comfortable<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
point where I'm comfortable with it but

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
point where I'm comfortable with it but
obviously<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> don't<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.270> nearly<00:01:33.600> enough

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
obviously I don't get nearly enough

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
obviously I don't get nearly enough
practice<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.369> digital<00:01:35.820> platform<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.479> be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
practice on the digital platform to be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
practice on the digital platform to be
able<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.869> achieve<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.530> hey<00:01:37.770> doing<00:01:38.040> my

is<00:01:45.780> Cthulhu<00:01:46.409> inspired<00:01:46.860> something<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
is Cthulhu inspired something that is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.389 
is Cthulhu inspired something that is
decorative<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.640> very<00:01:51.619> well<00:01:52.619> reminiscent

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
decorative and and very well reminiscent

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.030 
decorative and and very well reminiscent
of the<00:01:54.079> sea<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
of the sea and kind of like what a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.870 
of the sea and kind of like what a
pirate<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:59.340> obviously<00:01:59.729> in

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pirate would have and it's obviously in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
pirate would have and it's obviously in
color<00:02:00.180> which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.840> weak<00:02:01.110> point<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.710> hey

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
color which is my weak point but hey

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.209 
color which is my weak point but hey
again<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.790> trying<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.600> trying<00:02:04.219> my

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
again I'm trying I'm really trying my

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
again I'm trying I'm really trying my
problem<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:06.509> stuff<00:02:06.780> lacks<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
problem is that my stuff lacks the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
problem is that my stuff lacks the
crispness<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.190> sharpness<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
crispness and sharpness that a lot of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
crispness and sharpness that a lot of
the<00:02:09.360> blizzard<00:02:09.599> stuff<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.310> which<00:02:11.310> hopefully

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the blizzard stuff has which hopefully

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
the blizzard stuff has which hopefully
will<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.090> fixed<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.540> time<00:02:12.780> with

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
will get fixed in time with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.330 
will get fixed in time with
some<00:02:14.400> serious<00:02:14.730> practice<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.390> hey<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.890> takes

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
some serious practice but hey it takes

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.850 
some serious practice but hey it takes
this<00:02:17.670> stuff<00:02:18.030> takes<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.480> while<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.500> second

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
this stuff takes a while and the second

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.590 
this stuff takes a while and the second
one<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.870> black<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.900> white<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.500> which<00:02:22.710> is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
one is a black and white one which is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.240 
one is a black and white one which is
fastly<00:02:24.600> becoming<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:25.170> favorite<00:02:25.650> style<00:02:25.980> really

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
fastly becoming my favorite style really

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.060 
fastly becoming my favorite style really
it's<00:02:27.180> very<00:02:27.630> much<00:02:27.840> comic<00:02:28.200> book-like<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.860> very

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's very much comic book-like and very

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.120 
it's very much comic book-like and very
in<00:02:30.060> work<00:02:30.480> intense<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.410> problem<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in work intense the problem with the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.130 
in work intense the problem with the
black<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.460> white<00:02:32.640> style<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.900> takes

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
black and white style is that it takes

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.380 
black and white style is that it takes
much<00:02:34.260> longer<00:02:34.650> than<00:02:35.070> them<00:02:35.550> color<00:02:35.820> will<00:02:36.120> with

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
much longer than them color will with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.240 
much longer than them color will with
color<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.780> apply<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.110> background<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
color you apply the background you do a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.590 
color you apply the background you do a
little<00:02:38.460> bit<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.640> highlights<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.300> bit<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
little bit of highlights a bit of a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.330 
little bit of highlights a bit of a
little<00:02:39.870> bit<00:02:39.960> of<00:02:40.050> texture<00:02:40.290> work<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.740> that's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
little bit of texture work and that's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.150 
little bit of texture work and that's
basically<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.450> done<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.890> black

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
basically it it's done with the black

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.770 
basically it it's done with the black
and<00:02:44.340> white<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.910> trace<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.540> have

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and white you have to trace it you have

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.760 
and white you have to trace it you have
to<00:02:45.990> emboss<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:47.430> emboss<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:47.970> embellish

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to emboss the not emboss but embellish

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.290 
to emboss the not emboss but embellish
the<00:02:49.770> outline<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.490> make<00:02:50.670> sure<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.090> stuff

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
the outline and make sure that stuff

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.750 
the outline and make sure that stuff
pops<00:02:51.570> out<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.320> layered<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.400> top<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.640> each

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
pops out if it's layered on top of each

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.310 
pops out if it's layered on top of each
other<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.300> then<00:02:54.450> do<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> shading<00:02:54.990> which

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
other and then do the shading which

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.130 
other and then do the shading which
takes<00:02:56.130> ages<00:02:56.580> as<00:02:56.730> well<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.990> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
takes ages as well and so it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.840 
takes ages as well and so it's
just<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.530> lot<00:02:58.770> more<00:02:58.950> labor-intensive<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
just a lot more labor-intensive the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.150 
just a lot more labor-intensive the
first<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.240> took<00:03:00.480> under<00:03:01.260> two<00:03:01.650> hours<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.070> took

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
first one took under two hours it took

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040 
first one took under two hours it took
about<00:03:02.280> one<00:03:02.550> hour<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.820> 50<00:03:03.090> minutes<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
about one hour and 50 minutes and the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.010 
about one hour and 50 minutes and the
second<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.560> took<00:03:05.510> something<00:03:06.510> around<00:03:06.720> three

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
second one took something around three

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.680 
second one took something around three
hours<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.220> tell<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.490> difference<00:03:08.690> but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
hours so you can tell the difference but

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
hours so you can tell the difference but
I'm<00:03:09.780> gonna<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.050> doing<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.350> lot<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.530> these

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
I'm gonna be doing a lot of these

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.220 
I'm gonna be doing a lot of these
because<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.700> find<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.180> very<00:03:12.240> relaxing<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
because I I find it very relaxing to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.150 
because I I find it very relaxing to
just<00:03:13.850> draw<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.180> sketch<00:03:15.510> stuff<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.920> fly

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
just draw and sketch stuff on the fly

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.630 
just draw and sketch stuff on the fly
while<00:03:17.459> I'm<00:03:17.580> talking<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.940> someone<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.540> then

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
while I'm talking to someone and then

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.740 
while I'm talking to someone and then
paint<00:03:20.640> them<00:03:20.790> over<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> couple<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.360> days<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
paint them over a couple of days and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.820 
paint them over a couple of days and
that's<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.360> more<00:03:24.830> more

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
that's that so it's just more more

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.590 
that's that so it's just more more
interesting<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.520> more<00:03:26.610> brain<00:03:26.910> stimulating

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
interesting and more brain stimulating

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.449 
interesting and more brain stimulating
than<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.170> doing<00:03:28.230> monsters<00:03:28.800> all<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> time<00:03:29.250> or

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
than just doing monsters all the time or

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.460 
than just doing monsters all the time or
doing<00:03:30.390> daughter<00:03:30.570> characters<00:03:31.050> or<00:03:31.230> stuff<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
doing daughter characters or stuff that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
doing daughter characters or stuff that
people<00:03:31.770> have<00:03:31.980> already<00:03:32.130> drawn<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:32.970> that's

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
people have already drawn so that's

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.000 
people have already drawn so that's
basically<00:03:33.390> about<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.020> drawings<00:03:34.410> not<00:03:34.770> much

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
basically about the drawings not much

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.830 
basically about the drawings not much
more<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> say<00:03:35.489> oh<00:03:35.850> yeah<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.420> second<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:36.780> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
more to say oh yeah the second one is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.300 
more to say oh yeah the second one is
obviously<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.350> very<00:03:37.670> bony<00:03:38.670> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.270> weapon<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
obviously a very bony kind of weapon the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.570 
obviously a very bony kind of weapon the
spine<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.880> what<00:03:42.150> supports<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.840> blade<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.580> the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
spine is what supports the blade and the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.900 
spine is what supports the blade and the
bones<00:03:45.330> coming<00:03:45.690> out<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.019> or<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.910> magically

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
bones coming out of it or like magically

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.670 
bones coming out of it or like magically
fused<00:03:48.269> together<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.840> something<00:03:49.050> because<00:03:49.380> it's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
fused together or something because it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.350 
fused together or something because it's
definitely<00:03:49.830> unrealistic<00:03:50.550> then<00:03:50.940> no<00:03:51.120> bones

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
definitely unrealistic then no bones

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.940 
definitely unrealistic then no bones
would<00:03:51.600> stick<00:03:51.810> out<00:03:51.900> from<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.170> spine<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.739> that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
would stick out from a spine like that

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.250 
would stick out from a spine like that
but<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.700> doesn't<00:03:53.790> matter<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.930> handle

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
but it doesn't matter and on the handle

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.280 
but it doesn't matter and on the handle
there<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> thoracic<00:03:56.580> cage<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.570> has<00:03:57.780> has

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
there is a thoracic cage that has has

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.979 
there is a thoracic cage that has has
had<00:03:58.470> its<00:03:58.590> backside<00:03:59.010> ripped<00:03:59.340> apart<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.269> only

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
had its backside ripped apart and only

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.470 
had its backside ripped apart and only
basically<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> chest<00:04:01.709> area<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.480> finger

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
basically the chest area is the finger

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
basically the chest area is the finger
guard<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.410> one<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:05.010> attached<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.519> rope

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
guard on that one just attached to rope

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.759 
guard on that one just attached to rope
a<00:04:06.030> very<00:04:06.480> crude<00:04:06.840> looking<00:04:07.230> weapon<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:07.709> I

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
a very crude looking weapon but I

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.410 
a very crude looking weapon but I
thought<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.610> concept<00:04:08.970> was<00:04:09.060> kind<00:04:09.360> of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
thought it the concept was kind of

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.170 
thought it the concept was kind of
interesting<00:04:09.900> myself<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.470> why<00:04:10.800> not<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:12.000> that's

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
interesting myself so why not so that's

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.840 
interesting myself so why not so that's
it<00:04:12.330> let's<00:04:12.870> talk<00:04:13.019> about<00:04:13.170> other<00:04:13.410> stuff<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.950> have
