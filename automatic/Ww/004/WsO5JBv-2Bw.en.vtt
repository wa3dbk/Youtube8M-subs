to make a redstone timer now I did a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.539 
to make a redstone timer now I did a
video<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> tu9<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> day<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:14.309> this

video I have put a load of things on how

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.310 
video I have put a load of things on how
to<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> spawn<00:00:18.060> eggs<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:19.080> made<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
to use the spawn eggs and I made a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.620 
to use the spawn eggs and I made a
couple<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.680> timers<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> top

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
couple of timers and I think the top

comment was do a tutorial on how to make

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.269 
comment was do a tutorial on how to make
a<00:00:24.660> redstone<00:00:24.900> timer<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.220> I'm

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a redstone timer so this is what I'm

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.290 
a redstone timer so this is what I'm
gonna<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.490> doing<00:00:26.519> today<00:00:26.789> I'm<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.180> be

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
gonna be doing today I'm gonna be

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.330 
gonna be doing today I'm gonna be
showing<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.960> way<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.470> how<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:28.980> make<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
showing you my way on how to make a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.150 
showing you my way on how to make a
redstone<00:00:29.789> timer<00:00:30.679> it's<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> most

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
redstone timer it's not the most

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
redstone timer it's not the most
efficient<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.170> definitely

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
efficient way and but it's definitely

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
efficient way and but it's definitely
like<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> only<00:00:35.190> way<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.149> rest

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
like the only way I know that the rest

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.930 
like the only way I know that the rest
just<00:00:36.510> confused<00:00:36.960> me<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.520> simple

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
just confused me and this is like simple

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
just confused me and this is like simple
to<00:00:39.059> remember<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> show

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
to remember so I'm just going to show

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740 
to remember so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.710> example<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.390> let<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you an example and let me just get a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
you an example and let me just get a
minecart<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.550> tutorial

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
minecart out and for this tutorial

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299 
minecart out and for this tutorial
you're<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.600> need<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.800> powered<00:00:47.100> rails

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you're gonna need some powered rails

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
you're gonna need some powered rails
from<00:00:47.579> detector<00:00:48.030> rails<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.750> normal<00:00:49.230> rail

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
from detector rails some normal rail

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
from detector rails some normal rail
redstone<00:00:50.070> redstone<00:00:50.250> torch<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> something<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
redstone redstone torch and something to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
redstone redstone torch and something to
activate<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> pressure<00:00:53.070> plate<00:00:53.250> leave

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
activate it it's a pressure plate leave

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.080 
activate it it's a pressure plate leave
a<00:00:53.610> button<00:00:54.440> any<00:00:55.440> material<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.399> minecart

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a button any material and a minecart

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
a button any material and a minecart
so<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.329> gonna<00:00:57.480> set<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.809> off<00:00:58.129> I'll

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so we're just gonna set this off I'll

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.510 
so we're just gonna set this off I'll
just<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> diamond<00:01:00.510> saw<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.520> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
just get a diamond saw out just just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.719 
just get a diamond saw out just just
ready<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.430> gonna<00:01:05.519> step

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
ready and then right so we're gonna step

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.980 
ready and then right so we're gonna step
on<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.000> pressure<00:01:06.240> plate<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:08.840> things<00:01:09.840> are

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
on this pressure plate and things are

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
on this pressure plate and things are
gonna<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.350> quite<00:01:10.650> hairy<00:01:11.030> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> built

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gonna get quite hairy as you see I built

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
gonna get quite hairy as you see I built
this<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> tutorial<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> if

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this for the tutorial it's like a if

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
this for the tutorial it's like a if
using<00:01:15.210> making<00:01:15.990> under<00:01:16.140> venture<00:01:16.409> map<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
using making under venture map and it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
using making under venture map and it
got<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.210> zombie<00:01:18.479> boss<00:01:19.080> battle<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
got like a big zombie boss battle and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
got like a big zombie boss battle and
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> spoil<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> his

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you want it to spoil a lot of his

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
you want it to spoil a lot of his
minions<00:01:21.600> coming<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:21.930> his<00:01:22.020> mouth<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.619> use

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
minions coming out his mouth you can use

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.760 
minions coming out his mouth you can use
this<00:01:23.430> timer<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.650> carries<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this timer and it just carries on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.310 
this timer and it just carries on
spawning<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.460> until<00:01:26.790> they're<00:01:27.320> until

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
spawning them until they're until

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
spawning them until they're until
there's<00:01:28.439> no<00:01:28.560> eggs<00:01:28.740> left<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> dispensers

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
there's no eggs left in the dispensers

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.990 
there's no eggs left in the dispensers
so<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.259> good<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.820> say

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so this is like really good and as I say

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
so this is like really good and as I say
for<00:01:33.060> hunger<00:01:33.869> games<00:01:34.049> our<00:01:34.350> survivals<00:01:35.210> adventure

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
for hunger games our survivals adventure

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120 
for hunger games our survivals adventure
maps<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> stuff<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.290> yeah<00:01:37.500> enough

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
maps and stuff like that but yeah enough

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
maps and stuff like that but yeah enough
for<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.720> video<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.259> me

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
for that it's not a video about me

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
for that it's not a video about me
coming<00:01:40.619> zombies<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.030> try<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
coming zombies and so I'm gonna try that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
coming zombies and so I'm gonna try that
and<00:01:43.200> destroy<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.540> we're<00:01:45.540> gonna

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and destroy this right so we're gonna

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
and destroy this right so we're gonna
get<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> actual<00:01:46.590> tutorial<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.369> I'm

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
get on to the actual tutorial and I'm

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.200 
get on to the actual tutorial and I'm
gonna<00:01:48.210> show<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> guys<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
gonna show you guys how to do it and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.340 
gonna show you guys how to do it and
right<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> first<00:01:51.899> thing<00:01:52.110> you're<00:01:52.259> gonna

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
right so the first thing you're gonna

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.130 
right so the first thing you're gonna
need<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.420> something<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.450> activate<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
need is something to activate the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
need is something to activate the
pressure<00:01:55.380> activate<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> redstone<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pressure activate the redstone with so

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
pressure activate the redstone with so
it<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> pressure<00:01:57.689> player<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.170> lever<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it can be a pressure player a lever a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.289 
it can be a pressure player a lever a
button<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
button and if you like that just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.420 
button and if you like that just
something<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> activate<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> signal<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
something to activate the signal so you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
something to activate the signal so you
want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.909> your<00:02:03.210> pressure<00:02:03.450> plate<00:02:03.689> down

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
want to put your pressure plate down

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
want to put your pressure plate down
whatever<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.130> directly

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
whatever you want it and then directly

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.830 
whatever you want it and then directly
underneath<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> pressure<00:02:06.360> plate<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> want

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
underneath the pressure plate you want

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.859 
underneath the pressure plate you want
to<00:02:06.960> mind<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.469> block<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.629> need<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
to mind the block and then you need to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.010 
to mind the block and then you need to
put<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> redstone<00:02:10.610> down<00:02:11.610> underneath<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.900> when

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
put a redstone down underneath so when

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
put a redstone down underneath so when
you<00:02:13.140> step<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> prey

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you step on the prey

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.250 
you step on the prey
flip<00:02:14.270> if<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.570> out<00:02:15.690> flying<00:02:15.930> mode<00:02:16.110> is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
flip if I can get out flying mode is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.930 
flip if I can get out flying mode is
gonna<00:02:16.530> activate<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> signal<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
gonna activate a signal you see it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.090 
gonna activate a signal you see it
lights<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.180> Lin<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.770> see<00:02:19.920> it's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
lights up Lin see if I can you see it's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.330 
lights up Lin see if I can you see it's
lit<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.430> now<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.040> want<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.220> do

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
lit up now and then what you want to do

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.770 
lit up now and then what you want to do
is<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.210> part<00:02:24.450> where<00:02:24.630> we're<00:02:24.720> gonna

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
is this is the part where we're gonna

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.030 
is this is the part where we're gonna
make<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.350> actual<00:02:26.000> redstone<00:02:27.000> timer<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.800> I'll

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
make that actual redstone timer and I'll

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.200 
make that actual redstone timer and I'll
just<00:02:29.130> kill<00:02:29.340> these<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.580> buggers<00:02:29.940> because

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
just kill these little buggers because

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.940 
just kill these little buggers because
this<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.960> problem<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.740> on

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this is a problem when you have it on

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.420 
this is a problem when you have it on
and<00:02:33.350> not<00:02:34.350> peaceful<00:02:34.620> they're<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.310> many

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and not peaceful they're just so many

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600 
and not peaceful they're just so many
slimes<00:02:35.730> spawn<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.330> flat<00:02:36.630> wheels<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.610> it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
slimes spawn in flat wheels and it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.580 
slimes spawn in flat wheels and it's
covered<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.940> son-of<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.810> sir<00:02:40.080> you're

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
covered you son-of it right sir you're

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.770 
covered you son-of it right sir you're
gonna<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:40.950> your<00:02:41.190> redstone<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:42.000> you're<00:02:42.660> gonna

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
gonna get your redstone and you're gonna

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
gonna get your redstone and you're gonna
link<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:44.330> basically<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.660> near<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> wall<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
link it to basically like near a wall so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.770 
link it to basically like near a wall so
we're<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.670> gonna<00:02:47.880> move<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.210> over<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
we're just gonna move it over here and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.210 
we're just gonna move it over here and
then<00:02:49.350> what<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.530> want<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> do<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.070> want<00:02:50.190> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
then what you want to do is you want to
put<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.610> power<00:02:50.880> drill<00:02:51.060> down<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> corner

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
put your power drill down in the corner

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.520 
put your power drill down in the corner
and<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.580> detector<00:02:54.120> rail<00:02:54.350> then<00:02:55.350> your

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and then you detector rail then your

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.610 
and then you detector rail then your
rail<00:02:56.090> another<00:02:57.090> detector<00:02:57.540> rail<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:58.410> from

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
rail another detector rail and then from

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.880 
rail another detector rail and then from
here<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:59.010> backwards<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.120> just

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
here it's just backwards so it's just

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
here it's just backwards so it's just
rail<00:03:02.300> detector<00:03:03.300> rail<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.780> power<00:03:04.170> drill<00:03:04.350> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
rail detector rail and power drill so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
rail detector rail and power drill so
it's<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.770> from<00:03:05.130> there<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.880> same

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's just from there it's just the same

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's just from there it's just the same
here<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.510> got<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.980> powered<00:03:07.980> rail

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
here so you got and powered rail

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.340 
here so you got and powered rail
detector<00:03:08.550> rails<00:03:08.790> normal<00:03:09.060> rail<00:03:09.210> power<00:03:10.110> rail

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
detector rails normal rail power rail

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.780 
detector rails normal rail power rail
detector<00:03:10.710> l<00:03:10.890> normally<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.580> backwards

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
detector l normally it's just backwards

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.990 
detector l normally it's just backwards
right<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> basic<00:03:13.920> timer<00:03:14.220> okay

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
right so that is the basic timer okay

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.910 
right so that is the basic timer okay
might<00:03:15.240> not<00:03:15.390> look<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.660> lot<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:15.990> but<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:16.770> gonna

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
might not look a lot now but I'm gonna

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.190 
might not look a lot now but I'm gonna
show<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.190> how<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.640> gonna<00:03:17.730> actually<00:03:17.940> work<00:03:18.330> so

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
show you how it's gonna actually work so

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.380 
show you how it's gonna actually work so
what<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.190> want<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.030> want<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.209> put

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
what you want to do is you want to put

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.150 
what you want to do is you want to put
the<00:03:21.480> redstone<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.200> powered<00:03:22.470> rail<00:03:22.650> here

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the redstone to the powered rail here

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.580 
the redstone to the powered rail here
and<00:03:23.430> then<00:03:23.880> at<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> far<00:03:24.330> end<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.320> want<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
and then at the far end you want to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
and then at the far end you want to
build<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:26.100> wall<00:03:26.540> whatever<00:03:27.540> material<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.140> want

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
build a wall whatever material you want

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
redstone far so I want the timer to come

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.060 
redstone far so I want the timer to come
on<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.310> these<00:04:03.050> these<00:04:04.050> dispensers<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.770> can<00:04:04.920> do

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
on to these these dispensers you can do

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.320 
on to these these dispensers you can do
whatever<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.459> want<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.850> do<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.090> dolls

whatever you want you can do it to dolls
you<00:04:06.540> can<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.840> say<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.290> know<00:04:07.380> any<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:07.740> of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
you can do it say you know any kind of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.140 
you can do it say you know any kind of
contraption<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.490> I'm<00:04:08.610> just<00:04:08.730> going<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.000> use

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
contraption but I'm just going to use

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.729 
contraption but I'm just going to use
these<00:04:09.840> dispensers<00:04:10.560> um<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.810> we'll<00:04:13.620> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
these dispensers um and we'll just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.830 
these dispensers um and we'll just
replace<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.280> with<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.430> I'll<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.480> put<00:04:15.690> some

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
replace it with that I'll just put some

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.909 
replace it with that I'll just put some
of<00:04:15.900> these<00:04:16.049> repeaters<00:04:16.919> down<00:04:17.280> ok<00:04:18.030> now<00:04:18.919> so

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
of these repeaters down ok now so

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.310 
of these repeaters down ok now so
basically<00:04:19.950> what<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:20.970> does<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:22.049> put<00:04:22.080> the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
basically what this does is you put the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.469 
basically what this does is you put the
minecart<00:04:22.860> down<00:04:23.070> on<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.340> far<00:04:23.550> end<00:04:23.760> when<00:04:24.450> a

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
minecart down on the far end when a

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.600 
minecart down on the far end when a
redstone<00:04:24.870> signal<00:04:25.020> activates<00:04:26.010> it'll<00:04:26.610> activate

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
redstone signal activates it'll activate

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.040 
redstone signal activates it'll activate
m-miss<00:04:28.610> power<00:04:28.820> drill<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.870> mine

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
m-miss power drill and then the mine

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.960 
m-miss power drill and then the mine
counts<00:04:30.350> gonna<00:04:30.560> go<00:04:30.710> back<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.340> far<00:04:31.550> from<00:04:31.760> back

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
counts gonna go back and far from back

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.920 
counts gonna go back and far from back
and<00:04:32.180> forth<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:33.190> even<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.820> stuff<00:04:35.630> is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
and forth and even the this stuff is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.840 
and forth and even the this stuff is
like<00:04:36.350> lost<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.920> signal<00:04:37.130> you'll<00:04:37.400> still<00:04:37.640> keep

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
like lost the signal you'll still keep

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.190 
like lost the signal you'll still keep
going<00:04:38.000> because<00:04:38.210> we've<00:04:38.600> put<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> detector

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
going because we've put the detector

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.870 
going because we've put the detector
wheel<00:04:39.470> down<00:04:39.680> there<00:04:39.890> and<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.160> powers<00:04:40.760> the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
wheel down there and that powers the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.180 
wheel down there and that powers the
rail<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.530> gonna<00:04:42.650> send<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:43.010> pulse

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
rail and and it's gonna send a pulse

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.650 
rail and and it's gonna send a pulse
every<00:04:43.580> time<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.880> runs<00:04:44.000> over<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:44.420> middle

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
every time it runs over this middle

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.810 
every time it runs over this middle
track<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.140> gonna<00:04:45.230> like<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:46.100> line<00:04:46.610> up

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
track it's gonna like this this line up

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.850 
track it's gonna like this this line up
and<00:04:47.060> this<00:04:47.480> is<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.200> is<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.470> Redstone

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
and this is the this is the Redstone

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.280 
and this is the this is the Redstone
that<00:04:49.010> we<00:04:49.100> need<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.400> be<00:04:50.390> repeated<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.140> what

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
that we need to be repeated this is what

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.870 
that we need to be repeated this is what
we<00:04:51.350> need<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.560> time<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.920> our<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.250> right<00:04:52.760> I'm

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
we need the time of our so right I'm

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.040 
we need the time of our so right I'm
going<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.060> demonstrate<00:04:53.210> now<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:53.780> I'm<00:04:53.840> going<00:04:53.960> to

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
going to demonstrate now so I'm going to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.780 
going to demonstrate now so I'm going to
step<00:04:54.230> on<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.440> fresh<00:04:54.650> plate<00:04:54.920> it's<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.640> to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
step on this fresh plate it's going to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.790 
step on this fresh plate it's going to
activate<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.330> rail<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.410> it's<00:04:57.650> going<00:04:57.740> to

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
activate that rail and it's going to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.960 
activate that rail and it's going to
keep<00:04:57.950> going<00:04:58.160> back<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.400> forth<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:58.820> back<00:04:58.940> and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
keep going back and forth and back and

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.680 
keep going back and forth and back and
forth<00:04:59.150> so<00:04:59.600> ready<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.080> watch<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.360> redstone

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
forth so ready to watch so the redstone

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.720 
forth so ready to watch so the redstone
is<00:05:02.750> going<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.950> it's<00:05:04.100> running<00:05:04.310> over<00:05:04.490> that

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
is going and it's running over that

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.430 
is going and it's running over that
middle<00:05:05.000> thing<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.660> middle<00:05:05.870> detector<00:05:06.260> rail

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
middle thing that middle detector rail

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.620 
middle thing that middle detector rail
and<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.040> sending<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.400> signal<00:05:07.610> back<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.450> far

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
and it's sending a signal back and far

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.510 
and it's sending a signal back and far
from<00:05:08.870> back<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.320> forth<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.770> even<00:05:10.250> though<00:05:10.370> that

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
from back and forth and even though that

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.920 
from back and forth and even though that
nobody's<00:05:11.000> standing<00:05:11.180> on<00:05:11.450> this<00:05:11.540> pressure<00:05:11.780> plate

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
nobody's standing on this pressure plate

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.020 
nobody's standing on this pressure plate
anymore<00:05:12.440> it's<00:05:12.890> still<00:05:13.070> working<00:05:13.400> because<00:05:13.760> of

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
anymore it's still working because of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.640 
anymore it's still working because of
this<00:05:14.120> detector<00:05:14.630> rail<00:05:14.780> we<00:05:15.140> just<00:05:15.320> use<00:05:15.500> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
this detector rail we just use the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.800 
this detector rail we just use the
pressure<00:05:15.860> point<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.160> get<00:05:16.310> it<00:05:16.400> going<00:05:16.700> so<00:05:17.630> there

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
pressure point to get it going so there

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.690 
pressure point to get it going so there
we<00:05:17.870> go<00:05:17.900> that's<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.530> basic<00:05:18.920> redstone<00:05:19.310> timer

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
we go that's the basic redstone timer

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.000 
we go that's the basic redstone timer
okay<00:05:20.660> I'll<00:05:20.870> keep<00:05:21.020> firing<00:05:21.440> out<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:21.710> towards<00:05:21.920> no

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
okay I'll keep firing out and towards no

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.880 
okay I'll keep firing out and towards no
arrows<00:05:22.370> left<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.850> I've<00:05:23.690> set<00:05:23.990> one<00:05:24.170> up<00:05:24.290> here<00:05:24.470> and

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
arrows left and I've set one up here and

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.760 
arrows left and I've set one up here and
for<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.090> deadly<00:05:26.830> cow<00:05:27.830> attack<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:29.470> it's<00:05:30.470> kind<00:05:30.680> of

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
for a deadly cow attack and it's kind of

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.070 
for a deadly cow attack and it's kind of
cruel<00:05:31.010> but<00:05:31.280> it's<00:05:31.370> pretty<00:05:31.520> funny<00:05:31.820> as<00:05:31.970> well<00:05:32.080> and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
cruel but it's pretty funny as well and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.280 
cruel but it's pretty funny as well and
so<00:05:33.830> yeah<00:05:34.330> zombies<00:05:35.330> should<00:05:35.450> have<00:05:35.570> right<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:36.200> you

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
so yeah zombies should have right so you

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.620 
so yeah zombies should have right so you
can<00:05:36.440> use<00:05:36.620> this<00:05:36.830> any<00:05:37.070> way<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.310> want<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.790> you

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
can use this any way you want and you

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.450 
can use this any way you want and you
can<00:05:38.780> use<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:38.900> for<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.200> zombies<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:39.860> fires<00:05:40.220> out

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
can use it for the zombies so fires out

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.600 
can use it for the zombies so fires out
zombie<00:05:41.270> eggs<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:42.010> and<00:05:43.010> it'll<00:05:43.220> keep<00:05:43.370> going

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
zombie eggs and and it'll keep going

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.520 
zombie eggs and and it'll keep going
until<00:05:44.510> you<00:05:45.520> knock<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.730> minecart<00:05:47.150> off<00:05:47.530> they'll

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
until you knock the minecart off they'll

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.050 
until you knock the minecart off they'll
just<00:05:48.680> run<00:05:48.830> out<00:05:49.010> of<00:05:49.040> whatever<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.640> put<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:49.970> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
just run out of whatever you put in the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.880 
just run out of whatever you put in the
dispensers<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:51.380> can<00:05:51.500> probably<00:05:51.650> rig<00:05:51.860> a

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
dispensers and you can probably rig a

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.440 
dispensers and you can probably rig a
kill<00:05:52.190> switch<00:05:52.310> to<00:05:52.580> this<00:05:52.700> but<00:05:52.970> I<00:05:53.120> don't<00:05:53.330> really

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
kill switch to this but I don't really

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.280 
kill switch to this but I don't really
know<00:05:53.900> how<00:05:54.400> does<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.520> really<00:05:55.640> matter<00:05:55.880> em<00:05:56.390> but

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
know how does it really matter em but

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.110 
know how does it really matter em but
anyway<00:05:57.530> yeah<00:05:57.740> so<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.040> is<00:05:58.130> a<00:05:58.160> basic<00:05:58.370> redstone

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
anyway yeah so that is a basic redstone

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.260 
anyway yeah so that is a basic redstone
timer<00:05:59.720> tutorial<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.740> as<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:01.670> said<00:06:01.850> quite<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.090> lot

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
timer tutorial and as I said quite a lot

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.060 
timer tutorial and as I said quite a lot
of<00:06:02.300> them<00:06:02.450> are<00:06:02.600> quite<00:06:02.690> complicated<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.800> I

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
of them are quite complicated and I

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.700 
of them are quite complicated and I
don't<00:06:04.280> really<00:06:04.400> know<00:06:04.580> how<00:06:05.420> to<00:06:05.450> do<00:06:05.810> them<00:06:06.050> but

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
don't really know how to do them but

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.560 
don't really know how to do them but
this<00:06:06.830> one's<00:06:07.070> pretty<00:06:07.280> simple<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.090> easy<00:06:08.210> and

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
this one's pretty simple and easy and

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.940 
this one's pretty simple and easy and
all<00:06:09.380> it<00:06:09.470> takes<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:09.920> bit<00:06:10.010> of<00:06:10.300> rail<00:06:11.300> and<00:06:11.800> if<00:06:12.800> you

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
all it takes is a bit of rail and if you

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.400 
all it takes is a bit of rail and if you
register<00:06:13.370> on<00:06:13.430> things<00:06:13.700> and<00:06:14.180> so<00:06:14.810> yeah<00:06:14.960> there's<00:06:15.320> a

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
register on things and so yeah there's a

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.950 
register on things and so yeah there's a
redstone<00:06:15.800> time<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.310> tutorial<00:06:16.820> request<00:06:17.690> by<00:06:17.900> you

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
redstone time a tutorial request by you

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.190 
redstone time a tutorial request by you
guys<00:06:18.290> then<00:06:18.710> yeah<00:06:19.700> hope<00:06:20.660> you've<00:06:20.840> enjoyed<00:06:21.110> this
