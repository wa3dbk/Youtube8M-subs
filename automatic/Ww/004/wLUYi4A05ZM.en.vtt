tint<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.580> them<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.810> yeah<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:23.010> I

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
tint to them so yeah first thing I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.439 
tint to them so yeah first thing I
noticed<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.609> both<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:23.970> these<00:00:24.180> shoes<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
noticed about both of these shoes is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.650 
noticed about both of these shoes is
hugs<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:26.279> lighter<00:00:26.699> than<00:00:27.090> Bearpaw

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
hugs are way way lighter than Bearpaw

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
hugs are way way lighter than Bearpaw
and<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.320> think<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> reasons<00:00:29.279> might<00:00:29.460> be

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and I think one of the reasons might be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
and I think one of the reasons might be
is<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> sole<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> shoe<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
is because of the sole of the shoe the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.060 
is because of the sole of the shoe the
salsa<00:00:32.160> uggs<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.360> rubber<00:00:33.930> foam<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
salsa uggs are more like rubber foam it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.290 
salsa uggs are more like rubber foam it
no<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.760> more<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.030> foam<00:00:36.480> styrofoam<00:00:37.140> ish<00:00:37.350> but

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
no it's more like foam styrofoam ish but

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
no it's more like foam styrofoam ish but
yeah<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.170> squishy<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.829> bear

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
yeah it's kind of like squishy and bear

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.660 
yeah it's kind of like squishy and bear
paws<00:00:41.879> soul<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.170> rubber<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.280> feels<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
paws soul is like rubber and it feels a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
paws soul is like rubber and it feels a
lot<00:00:44.850> sturdier<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> really

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
lot sturdier and if you have a really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
lot sturdier and if you have a really
bad<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.390> walking<00:00:48.690> problem<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.590> me<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
bad like walking problem like me it

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.479

wears<00:00:50.730> down<00:00:50.899> super<00:00:51.899> fast<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> heel

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
wears down super fast like on the heel

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.439 
wears down super fast like on the heel
and<00:00:55.280> Bearpaw<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.430> feel<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> wouldn't<00:00:57.270> do

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and Bearpaw I feel like it wouldn't do

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
and Bearpaw I feel like it wouldn't do
that<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> rubber<00:00:59.039> sole

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that as much because of the rubber sole

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.130 
that as much because of the rubber sole
so<00:01:00.469> yeah<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
so yeah and if you just look at them the
first<00:01:04.379> things<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> notice<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> stitching

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

on<00:01:06.450> ugh<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.409> cleaner<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:09.450> bare<00:01:10.140> paws

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.990 

and<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> fur<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> gray<00:01:16.860> uggs<00:01:17.189> match<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and the fur for the gray uggs match the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.100 
and the fur for the gray uggs match the
color<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.790> leather<00:01:21.030> well<00:01:21.840> bear

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
color of the of the leather well bear

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
color of the of the leather well bear
paws<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> different<00:01:23.070> color<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.790> bear<00:01:24.780> paw

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
paws is a different color and bear paw

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
paws is a different color and bear paw
and<00:01:25.320> ugh<00:01:25.590> both<00:01:25.890> use<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.369> real<00:01:26.640> leather<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and ugh both use like real leather and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.920 
and ugh both use like real leather and
real<00:01:27.810> fur<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.150> feel<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.420> there's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
real fur so I don't feel like there's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.359 
real fur so I don't feel like there's
that<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> difference

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that much of a difference

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.300 
that much of a difference
I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.820> bear<00:01:33.689> paws<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.860> softer

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I think bear paws is actually softer

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
I think bear paws is actually softer
than<00:01:35.460> us<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.060> Uggs

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
last a lot longer like it's a lot more

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
