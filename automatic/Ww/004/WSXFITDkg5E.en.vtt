so<00:03:45.780> funny<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.380> people<00:03:46.410> say<00:03:46.830> you're<00:03:46.950> not

so funny when people say you're not

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.620 
so funny when people say you're not
going<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:47.519> enough<00:03:47.760> protein<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.330> fruits

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
going to get enough protein on fruits

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.560 
going to get enough protein on fruits
and<00:03:48.720> vegetables<00:03:49.290> yet<00:03:49.950> gorillas<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> cows<00:03:51.180> and

all the other vegetarian animals that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.550 
all the other vegetarian animals that
eat<00:03:53.730> fruits<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.510> vegetables<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.350> get

eat fruits and vegetables don't get
enough<00:03:55.769> protein

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
enough protein

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
enough protein
I<00:03:56.459> think<00:03:56.880> mac<00:03:57.060> danzig<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.470> a

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
I think mac danzig is going to be a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.650 
I think mac danzig is going to be a
great<00:03:59.010> example<00:03:59.519> for<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.820> type<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.239> lifestyle

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
great example for this type of lifestyle

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.160 
great example for this type of lifestyle
showing<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.160> done<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:03.170> sports

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
showing that it can be done in sports

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.620 
showing that it can be done in sports
that<00:04:04.410> actually<00:04:05.010> don't<00:04:05.250> take<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.850> much<00:04:06.450> of

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
that actually don't take as much of

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.690 
that actually don't take as much of
endurance<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.350> cycling<00:04:07.920> running<00:04:08.220> or<00:04:08.519> swimming

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700

do<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.660> mac<00:04:09.870> danzig<00:04:10.350> really<00:04:10.620> showed<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.370> a

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
do the mac danzig really showed that a

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.670 
do the mac danzig really showed that a
vegan<00:04:11.820> diet<00:04:12.150> works<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.840> think<00:04:13.350> he's<00:04:13.440> going<00:04:13.590> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
vegan diet works I think he's going to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.259 
vegan diet works I think he's going to
be<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:14.130> great<00:04:14.340> example<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> raw

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
be a really great example that a raw

be a really great example that a raw
vegan<00:04:15.510> diet<00:04:15.750> does<00:04:16.410> work<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.549> when
