00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
I'd put one more boost in there it'll

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.479 
I'd put one more boost in there it'll
get<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.720> 50<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:49.350> three<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.830> don't<00:02:51.130> know<00:02:51.220> I'm

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.120 

okay<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.169> kind<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> sucks<00:04:56.650> maybe<00:04:56.950> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
okay so that kind of sucks maybe I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.580 
okay so that kind of sucks maybe I
shouldn't<00:04:57.400> have<00:04:57.460> done<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:58.139> because<00:04:59.139> it<00:04:59.500> was

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
shouldn't have done that because it was

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.840 
shouldn't have done that because it was
going<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.830> lose<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> place<00:05:00.370> because<00:05:00.700> it's

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
going to lose to a place because it's

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.820 
going to lose to a place because it's
only<00:05:01.000> level<00:05:01.300> 50<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.960> I'm<00:05:02.020> pretty<00:05:02.440> sure<00:05:02.560> that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
only level 50 and I'm pretty sure that

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.560 
only level 50 and I'm pretty sure that
blazes<00:05:03.610> next<00:05:04.350> so<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.710> then<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:07.000> wonder<00:05:07.450> how<00:05:07.510> it

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
blazes next so and then I wonder how it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:17.250 
blazes next so and then I wonder how it
will<00:05:07.660> do<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:12.010> armor<00:05:12.280> is<00:05:12.310> awesome<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:16.260> think

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
will do that armor is awesome I think

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.810 
will do that armor is awesome I think
I'm<00:05:17.440> going<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.620> make<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:17.979> my<00:05:18.190> main<00:05:18.400> armor

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
I'm going to make that my main armor

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.779 
I'm going to make that my main armor
because<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:20.139> like<00:05:20.560> probably<00:05:21.310> going<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.700> be

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
because it's like probably going to be

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.330 
because it's like probably going to be
the<00:05:21.820> best<00:05:22.000> armor<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.510> game<00:05:23.160> like<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.280> said

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
the best armor in the game like I said

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.140 
the best armor in the game like I said
in<00:05:24.580> my<00:05:24.610> other<00:05:24.849> video<00:05:24.970> Devore<00:05:26.820> but<00:05:27.820> look<00:05:27.910> at<00:05:28.060> it
