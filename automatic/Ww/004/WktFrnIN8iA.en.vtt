00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.749 

now<00:00:01.750> I<00:00:01.780> cut<00:00:02.050> off<00:00:02.199> a<00:00:02.230> strand<00:00:02.830> of<00:00:03.009> red<00:00:03.279> and<00:00:03.639> I'm

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:03.759 
now I cut off a strand of red and I'm

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:05.519 
now I cut off a strand of red and I'm
going<00:00:03.969> to<00:00:04.029> split<00:00:04.299> it<00:00:04.450> in<00:00:04.540> half<00:00:04.600> this<00:00:04.990> is<00:00:05.140> four

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:05.529 
going to split it in half this is four

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.910 
going to split it in half this is four
ply<00:00:05.830> worsted<00:00:06.069> weight<00:00:06.580> and<00:00:07.060> it's<00:00:07.209> some

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
ply worsted weight and it's some

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.910 
ply worsted weight and it's some
leftover<00:00:09.210> red<00:00:10.210> heart<00:00:10.480> yarn<00:00:10.780> that<00:00:11.500> I'm<00:00:11.650> using

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
leftover red heart yarn that I'm using

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.869 
leftover red heart yarn that I'm using
here<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:14.049> I<00:00:14.080> combined<00:00:14.589> the<00:00:14.740> yarns<00:00:15.160> frequently

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
here so I combined the yarns frequently

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.750 
here so I combined the yarns frequently
and<00:00:16.120> use<00:00:16.270> them<00:00:16.510> for<00:00:16.690> various<00:00:16.750> things

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and use them for various things

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.100 
and use them for various things
sometimes<00:00:18.760> they<00:00:18.940> work<00:00:19.120> sometimes<00:00:19.150> they<00:00:19.930> don't

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
sometimes they work sometimes they don't

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.520 
sometimes they work sometimes they don't
now<00:00:20.980> red<00:00:21.280> heart<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:21.940> Karin<00:00:22.450> do<00:00:22.900> not<00:00:23.050> work<00:00:23.290> well

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
now red heart and Karin do not work well

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.680 
now red heart and Karin do not work well
together<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.150> size<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.920> too<00:00:26.920> much<00:00:27.690> so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
together because the size is too much so

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.490 
together because the size is too much so
but<00:00:29.620> they<00:00:29.980> do<00:00:30.040> work<00:00:30.340> good<00:00:30.790> together

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
but they do work good together

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.439 
but they do work good together
when<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:34.120> using<00:00:34.359> them<00:00:34.989> for<00:00:35.019> embellishing

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
when you're using them for embellishing

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.689 
when you're using them for embellishing
so<00:00:37.449> well<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.140> end<00:00:38.440> didn't<00:00:39.070> do<00:00:39.219> very<00:00:39.249> well<00:00:39.519> I

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
so well that end didn't do very well I

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.919 
so well that end didn't do very well I
need<00:00:39.969> to<00:00:39.999> get<00:00:40.210> two<00:00:40.929> strands<00:00:41.530> together<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.929> so

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
need to get two strands together here so

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.810 
need to get two strands together here so
they<00:00:44.170> yeah<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.309> one<00:00:45.489> will<00:00:45.609> work

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
they yeah this one will work

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.110 
they yeah this one will work
so<00:00:46.210> they<00:00:46.329> unravel<00:00:46.719> apart<00:00:47.230> like<00:00:47.409> that<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
so they unravel apart like that the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.200 
so they unravel apart like that the
other<00:00:49.269> second<00:00:49.809> strand<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.289> had<00:00:50.819> wasn't<00:00:51.819> working

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
other second strand I had wasn't working

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:04.410 
other second strand I had wasn't working
because<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:55.329> were<00:00:55.390> across<00:00:56.170> from<00:00:56.530> each<00:00:56.710> other

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420

running out of thread and then I'm just
going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.410> continue<00:02:48.950> with<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.310> other<00:02:49.340> strand

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
going to continue with the other strand

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390 
going to continue with the other strand
adding<00:02:51.980> some<00:02:52.660> vessels<00:02:53.660> bloodshot<00:02:54.410> vessels

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
adding some vessels bloodshot vessels

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.540 
adding some vessels bloodshot vessels
around<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.970> eye<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:58.310> just

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.320 
around the eye just like that it just
gives<00:02:58.700> them<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.270> added<00:02:59.450> creep<00:02:59.960> factor

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360

one of those machines you could do that
as<00:03:18.770> well<00:03:19.150> I'm<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.540> work<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.840> chain<00:03:21.080> three

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
as well I'm going to work a chain three

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
as well I'm going to work a chain three
and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.180> put<00:03:23.360> my<00:03:23.480> hook<00:03:23.690> through<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.960> next

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
and then put my hook through the next

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.610 
and then put my hook through the next
stitch<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.680> I'm<00:03:24.800> leaving<00:03:25.010> all<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.550> loops<00:03:25.820> on

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
stitch and I'm leaving all the loops on

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.770 
stitch and I'm leaving all the loops on
and<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.680> want<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.160> careful<00:03:28.490> not<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.300> drop

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and you want to be careful not to drop

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.630 
and you want to be careful not to drop
them<00:03:30.110> off<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:30.710> you'll<00:03:30.830> want<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.040> pitch<00:03:31.250> ahold

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
them off so you'll want to pitch ahold

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.250 
them off so you'll want to pitch ahold
of<00:03:31.760> them<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:34.510> shouldn't<00:03:35.510> say<00:03:35.780> drop<00:03:36.080> them

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
of them and so I shouldn't say drop them

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.880 
of them and so I shouldn't say drop them
off<00:03:36.350> because<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:36.710> want<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.100> drop<00:03:37.340> them<00:03:37.580> off<00:03:37.790> I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
off because you want to drop them off I

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.680 
off because you want to drop them off I
mean<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.010> pull<00:03:40.280> them<00:03:40.400> through<00:03:40.430> because<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:41.360> did

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
mean to pull them through because I did

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.300 
mean to pull them through because I did
that<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:41.900> pulled<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.680> through<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.220> then

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
that I pulled one through and then

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.800 
that I pulled one through and then
you've<00:03:43.430> got<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.760> start<00:03:44.030> over<00:03:44.180> again<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.780> you

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
you've got to start over again so you

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.050 
you've got to start over again so you
keep<00:03:45.080> pulling<00:03:45.440> them<00:03:45.530> up<00:03:45.710> like<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.190> pinch<00:03:46.910> a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
keep pulling them up like that pinch a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.300 
keep pulling them up like that pinch a
hold<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.450> them<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:47.810> they<00:03:47.930> don't<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.130> don't

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
hold of them so they don't so you don't

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.000 
hold of them so they don't so you don't
pull<00:03:49.550> them<00:03:49.670> through<00:03:50.350> then<00:03:51.350> drop<00:03:51.680> everything

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
pull them through then drop everything

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
pull them through then drop everything
off<00:03:52.460> pull<00:03:52.910> through<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.240> first<00:03:53.600> then<00:03:54.110> pick<00:03:54.440> up

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
off pull through the first then pick up

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.130 
off pull through the first then pick up
the<00:03:54.800> second<00:03:55.340> middle<00:03:55.670> one<00:03:55.850> like<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.300> pull

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
the second middle one like that pull

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.340 
the second middle one like that pull
through<00:03:57.470> then<00:03:57.980> pick<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.640> third<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.420> pull

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
through then pick up the third and pull

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.640 
through then pick up the third and pull
through<00:04:00.710> and<00:04:01.640> right<00:04:02.570> now<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:02.990> flat<00:04:03.440> but

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
through and right now it is flat but

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.120 
through and right now it is flat but
eventually<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.250> will<00:04:04.280> start<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:05.920> curve<00:04:06.920> on

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
eventually it will start to curve on

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.990 
eventually it will start to curve on
around<00:04:07.490> itself<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.090> turn<00:04:08.330> into<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:10.100> round

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
around itself and turn into a a round

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.300 
around itself and turn into a a round
shape<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.420> I'm<00:04:14.600> doing<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.140> for<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.800> little

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
shape and so I'm doing this for a little

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.890 
shape and so I'm doing this for a little
bit<00:04:16.459> I'm<00:04:16.670> going<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.970> go<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.209> ahead<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.630> do<00:04:17.750> it

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
bit I'm going to go on ahead and do it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.540 
bit I'm going to go on ahead and do it
for<00:04:18.520> several<00:04:19.520> more<00:04:19.820> rows<00:04:20.859> now<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:21.920> want<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.310> add

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
for several more rows now I want to add

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.580 
for several more rows now I want to add
in<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:22.970> couple<00:04:23.210> more<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.750> time<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.320> I'm<00:04:24.410> going

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
in a couple more this time so I'm going

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680 
in a couple more this time so I'm going
to<00:04:24.710> pinch<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.130> hold<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.520> these<00:04:25.640> really<00:04:26.030> good<00:04:26.330> and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
to pinch a hold of these really good and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.480 
to pinch a hold of these really good and
I'm<00:04:26.960> going<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.290> add<00:04:27.500> in<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:28.010> more<00:04:28.250> loop

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
I'm going to add in one more loop

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.810 
I'm going to add in one more loop
between<00:04:29.560> let's<00:04:30.560> hope<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.980> can<00:04:31.190> do<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.550> without

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
between let's hope I can do this without

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.500 
between let's hope I can do this without
pulling<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.570> through<00:04:34.090> it's<00:04:35.090> gonna<00:04:35.240> be<00:04:35.480> a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
pulling it through it's gonna be a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.800 
pulling it through it's gonna be a
little<00:04:35.720> tricky<00:04:36.470> there

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.080 

I'm<00:04:41.810> just<00:04:42.080> gonna<00:04:42.200> pick<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:43.040> back<00:04:43.760> up

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
I'm just gonna pick this one back up

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.660 
I'm just gonna pick this one back up
like<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:47.860> now<00:04:48.860> I'm<00:04:48.980> going<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.250> pick<00:04:49.460> up

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
like that now I'm going to pick up

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.600 
like that now I'm going to pick up
between<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:51.170> one<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.500> want<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:51.980> hold<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.400> to

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
between this one I want to hold on to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.910 
between this one I want to hold on to
them<00:04:52.760> so<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.630> don't<00:04:53.750> pull<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.140> through<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.620> this

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
them so I don't pull it through and this

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.280 
them so I don't pull it through and this
is<00:04:54.980> my<00:04:55.340> increasing<00:04:56.180> like<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.660> I'm<00:04:56.900> going<00:04:57.140> to

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
is my increasing like that I'm going to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.190 
is my increasing like that I'm going to
increase<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:58.040> little<00:04:58.070> bit<00:04:58.930> larger<00:04:59.930> no<00:05:00.080> I'm

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
increase it a little bit larger no I'm

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.490 
increase it a little bit larger no I'm
going<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.410> drop<00:05:00.650> them<00:05:01.340> off<00:05:02.260> except<00:05:03.260> for<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
going to drop them off except for the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.400 
going to drop them off except for the
first<00:05:03.770> one<00:05:03.950> pull<00:05:04.910> through<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.740> pull<00:05:09.800> through

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
first one pull through and pull through

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.410 
first one pull through and pull through
pick<00:05:12.410> up<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:14.530> strand<00:05:15.530> pull<00:05:16.040> through<00:05:16.430> pick<00:05:17.270> up

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
pick up the strand pull through pick up

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.020 
pick up the strand pull through pick up
the<00:05:17.570> strand<00:05:17.930> pull<00:05:18.230> through

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
the strand pull through

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.480 
the strand pull through
pick<00:05:20.030> up<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.450> strand<00:05:20.870> pull<00:05:21.860> through<00:05:22.250> or<00:05:22.460> I

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
pick up the strand pull through or I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.930 
pick up the strand pull through or I
probably<00:05:22.850> should<00:05:23.240> say<00:05:23.270> loop<00:05:23.890> but<00:05:24.890> strand<00:05:25.760> of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
probably should say loop but strand of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.390 
probably should say loop but strand of
yarn<00:05:26.120> loop<00:05:26.650> same<00:05:27.650> difference

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
yarn loop same difference

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.890 
yarn loop same difference
so<00:05:28.880> I'm<00:05:28.970> going<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.300> drop<00:05:29.600> off<00:05:30.010> four<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:34.100> then

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
so I'm going to drop off four and then

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.370 
so I'm going to drop off four and then
pull<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.080> through<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:39.200> first<00:05:41.170> pick<00:05:42.170> up<00:05:42.350> the

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
pull it through the first pick up the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.660
