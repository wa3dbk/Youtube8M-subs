00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.179
 hello to all in this video I wanted you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.179
 register how to mount a shovel 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.099
 to moms on a sea slipper case is 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.369
 very simple enough to have a bit of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.369
 patience and everyone wants to get out 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.330
 then we will begin by inserting the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.730
 back of the shovel in the pocket 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 below the pin up letting you help from 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.130
 maybe someone will turn out more if need be 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 proceed with a little pressure doing 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.489
 tilt a little bit to the shovel up to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.829
 match the holes with holes in the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.120
 shoe once made to match i 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.350
 shovel holes with those of the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 slipper 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.430
 don't worry about using a little 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.399
 force the important thing is that you take the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.800
 always ball of water down and not from here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.320
 because it is much more flexible more 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.979
 soft the ball then from here and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.159
 using a bit of strength this is the kit 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.180
 mares for the rocket shoe because 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.180
 it is sold separately 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.070
 we insert this small piece in the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.070
 shoe in the right position 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:32.409
 let's keep it from below and insert another 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.579
 small piece reminding us to put it from 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.659
 part 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.520
 av the most pointed part towards the tip 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.049
 of the blade and the part I am going 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 towards the part smashed by a shoe 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 we fix with yeasts present in the roof 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 of assembly 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.310
 without doing too much strength enough 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.230
 pushing debts is just so that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.330
 we will get work like that and the ball 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.800
 the shoe will already be fixed enough 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.530
 once the shoe is fixed with the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.370
 screws we will proceed in the king paper 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.020
 slightly profile as far as it attacks 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.070
 obviously cauldron so yes and then 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.360
 bonding is more effective 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.150
 we will get so greater 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.150
 grip on the shoe's longitudinal member 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.379
 once printed and of course 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.689
 small gum residues will remain with 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.069
 in short, a slightly wet cloth 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:01.120
 moist we will clean the profile 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.359
 rubber and we'll see that anyway 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.359
 it remains a lot 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.859
 this process is very important 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.970
 since it could compromise precisely the 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 the fixing of the longitudinal member of the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.299
 room 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.099
 gluing of the side members on the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.280
 shovel I chose a glue taken in a 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:35.170
 all that man bicycle top kit 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.319
 by the way it costs 5 euros accessible a 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.840
 price very accessible to all but 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.459
 you can also use putty all the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.110
 crowds, in short, that remain anyway 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.440
 elastic this is a very argument 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.500
 discussed on the web 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.690
 then we take the rubber profile there 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.569
 wants some strength here too and 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.500
 someone has to help me and put you one 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.799
 glue thread I prefer to put it on 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.010
 indeed Pontine and put it under a flush 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.010
 whole is very little 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.960
 the bottom maybe vect shrewdness of 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:33.740
 put a little more but maybe in 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.979
 more points instead of more glue because then 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:46.069
 he will succeed and will go on the ball and then 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:47.259
 you will have to clean it we are right up to 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.259
 background 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.259
 ok 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.650
 for entering also is not in the profile 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.890
 of the shovel I advise you to use this 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.840
 method or applied monterone 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:06.470
 make sure you enter it well 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:11.200
 at the beginning I always recommend 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:16.080
 let's fold the blogger one 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.080
 and let's do some strength 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.460
 once entered 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.740
 on both sides we press for 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.539
 well 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.860
 we feel impression for about one 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.990
 minute once dried 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.210
 obviously it won't be perfectly 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.909
 dry again but we'll have to give another 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.870
 the time to adhere well we will put 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:49.150
 the clip always from the mares kit 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.949
 remaining the first from a point that can 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.300
 be upstairs and helping yourself to a 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:56.439
 small you have flat pry and 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.840
 put it inside 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.590
 engages participate in a facility 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:07.240
 incredible and remains for adherence to 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.750
 first once you have glued both of them together 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.629
 spars I admitted simply a 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.949
 piece of paper to this will follow some 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:21.610
 scotch and to do it to keep them well 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:24.189
 you keep us in twenty minutes 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.509
 half an hour can be enough 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:33.150
 most used leaves 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:37.020
 nothing I will surely show you how 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.950
 then the fins of water will go and we will draw 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.090
 other bruises 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.090
 Hi everyone
