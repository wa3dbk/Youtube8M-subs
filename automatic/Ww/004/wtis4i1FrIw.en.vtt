outlet to another depending on grade so
sometimes<00:00:35.200> you'll<00:00:35.440> see<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.649> quite<00:00:36.190> a

sometimes you'll see a quite a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.729 
sometimes you'll see a quite a
difference<00:00:36.700> in<00:00:36.940> price<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:37.809> if<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.530> ask

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
difference in price and if you ask

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.200 
difference in price and if you ask
you'll<00:00:38.980> find<00:00:39.219> out<00:00:39.340> it's<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.670> different<00:00:39.789> grade

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
you'll find out it's a different grade

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.779 
you'll find out it's a different grade
and<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:41.199> can't<00:00:41.500> tell<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:41.949> all<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.430> different

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
and I can't tell you all the different

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.170 
and I can't tell you all the different
grades<00:00:43.690> there<00:00:44.469> are<00:00:44.739> but<00:00:45.520> some<00:00:45.850> lumber

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
grades there are but some lumber

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.029 
grades there are but some lumber
companies<00:00:46.629> will<00:00:46.870> well<00:00:47.260> have<00:00:47.440> one<00:00:47.770> grade

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
companies will well have one grade

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.130 
companies will well have one grade
because<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.609> lumberyard<00:00:49.480> down<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.899> street

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
because the lumberyard down the street

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.470 
because the lumberyard down the street
has<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.559> different<00:00:51.070> grade<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:52.059> that's<00:00:52.329> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
has a different grade so that's the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.889 
has a different grade so that's the
reason<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.899> shop<00:00:53.190> pricing<00:00:54.190> most<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.120> your

reason to shop pricing most of your

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.750 
reason to shop pricing most of your
lumber<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.289> would<00:00:56.680> recommend<00:00:57.160> buying<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.550> as<00:00:57.730> a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
lumber I would recommend buying it as a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.110 
lumber I would recommend buying it as a

dry kiln dried lumber you're going to

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.320 
dry kiln dried lumber you're going to

the lumber as it dries out particularly

the lumber as it dries out particularly
if<00:01:06.850> it's<00:01:07.390> if<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.930> project<00:01:08.350> takes<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.920> long<00:01:09.280> time
