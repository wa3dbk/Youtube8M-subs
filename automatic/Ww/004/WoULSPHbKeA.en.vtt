 and surely is affected by the crisis or by unemployment or both 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.480
 Maybe it's the ones who decided and if this year's vacation on their own 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.480
 car accept or not 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:14.839
 let's go for all 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.869
 the end of March 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.480
 he had just done now that he has left more or less in each case 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 shortly after the one to the other but for bad it is thus 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.740
 in improving access as they many families are deciding to travel 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.050
 in your own car these holidays 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.750
 due to the economic crisis 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 we wonder how we can save fuel if we go behind the wheel to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.790
 we go to a specialist in order to explain some 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 techniques that help us achieve our goal 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 we will be able to save fuel 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.920
 as a driver 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 For that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.970
 the grenade grenade the first key to save fuel in the Canary Islands 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.400
 Arabs are sick 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.090
 I do not know the diesel engines that we have today 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.940
 it is said that the change doing training and between the family 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.930
 returns 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.360
 note the maximum performance without the need to trigger the consumption if 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.730
 we put deadlock 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.030
 let's see how it immediately starts iniesta asarco deadlock then do 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 more and look how to defend 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 from 0 to 0 serene not for example 5 12 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.420
 good afternoon to the national b 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.660
 karÃ­mova on the third floor of the back foot don qui retells the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.280
 ritual energy is going to put was that vodafone since it's not going to serve for 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.740
 save fuel 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.550
 to take advantage of the descending slope 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.640
 the lieutenant of san antonio that we are going to do is 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.120
 so far the exact number of March is unknown 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.750
 to see how it was nullified in the present mandate for example now that 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.560
 we go in second Pablo portela of the city to change to third 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 and then we change back to door 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 What we are going to do to save is directly take advantage of the descent and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.830
 second we are accelerating 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.420
 days in a salt statue 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.880
 so take good note 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.290
 because with an efficient driving car drivers can save 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.469
 a year about 400 euros in fuel 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.379
 while those behind the wheel of a truck can save up to 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.449
 one month's salary 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 it only remains to put into practice what we have learned 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.569
 well in addition to saving 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.640
 in the steering wheel that every year the balance of the trip in the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.969
 abroad on this occasion because of the crisis they thought about tourism 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.939
