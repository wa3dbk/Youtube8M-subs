00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
first thing that strikes me is graphics

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330 
first thing that strikes me is graphics
actually<00:00:24.020> much<00:00:24.320> better<00:00:24.590> than<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.220> was

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
actually much better than I was

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.910 
actually much better than I was
expecting<00:00:25.869> framerate<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:27.230> nice<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.619> smooth

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
expecting framerate is nice and smooth

better<00:00:30.289> demonstration<00:00:30.860> of<00:00:31.070> frame<00:00:31.310> rate<00:00:31.490> and

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
better demonstration of frame rate and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.779 
better demonstration of frame rate and
it's<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:33.559> running<00:00:33.920> very<00:00:34.129> smoothly<00:00:34.430> indeed

language of the car you know it's not

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.500 
language of the car you know it's not
reaching<00:00:49.039> it's<00:00:49.219> moving<00:00:49.789> around<00:00:50.059> on<00:00:50.329> its

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
reaching it's moving around on its

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.629 
reaching it's moving around on its
suspension<00:00:50.929> it's<00:00:51.469> doing<00:00:51.829> stuff<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:52.429> can

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
suspension it's doing stuff you can

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
there's all that kind of crazy sliding

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.649 
there's all that kind of crazy sliding
to<00:00:55.069> it<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.280> everything<00:00:55.609> else<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.389> works

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
you know if you've played driver and you

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.799 
you know if you've played driver and you
know<00:00:58.399> what<00:00:58.579> may<00:00:58.729> drive<00:00:58.999> is<00:00:59.179> successful<00:00:59.659> in<00:00:59.749> the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
know what may drive is successful in the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.599 
know what may drive is successful in the
first<00:01:00.019> place<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.589> was<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.859> kind<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.249> handling

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
first place it was that kind of handling

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.210 
first place it was that kind of handling
and<00:01:01.819> it's<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.449> lot<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.629> fun<00:01:02.749> to<00:01:03.170> play<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.979> doesn't

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
and it's a lot of fun to play it doesn't

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.860 
and it's a lot of fun to play it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:04.280> again<00:01:04.850> as<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.420> say<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.690> doesn't

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
necessarily again as I say it doesn't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.510 
necessarily again as I say it doesn't
need<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.080> be<00:01:06.200> realistic<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:07.010> just<00:01:07.190> needs<00:01:07.369> to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
need to be realistic it just needs to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.550 
need to be realistic it just needs to
work<00:01:07.729> within<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.180> world<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:08.689> in<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.200> it

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
work within the world it's in and it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.620 
work within the world it's in and it
needs<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.920> feel<00:01:10.189> right<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.270> think<00:01:11.479> for<00:01:11.570> a

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
needs to feel right and I think for a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.969 
needs to feel right and I think for a
lot<00:01:11.719> of<00:01:11.780> people<00:01:11.899> drive<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.860> be<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
lot of people drive is going to be a

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.039 
lot of people drive is going to be a
really<00:01:13.250> crazy<00:01:13.549> experience<00:01:14.479> getting<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.840> back

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
really crazy experience getting the back

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.139 
really crazy experience getting the back
end<00:01:15.320> out<00:01:15.530> tanks<00:01:16.070> left<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.460> all<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.700> rest<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:17.030> it

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
end out tanks left as all the rest of it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.200 
end out tanks left as all the rest of it
so<00:01:18.100> obviously<00:01:19.100> my<00:01:19.280> died<00:01:19.340> over<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.939> US

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210

doesn't<00:01:48.499> it<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.619> mean<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.609> have<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.880> consider

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
doesn't it I mean you have to consider

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.929 
doesn't it I mean you have to consider
the<00:01:50.420> size<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.990> environment<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:51.799> as<00:01:52.609> well

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
the size of the environment here as well

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.880 
the size of the environment here as well
I<00:01:53.210> mean<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.689> big<00:01:53.960> environment<00:01:54.530> as<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> lot

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
I mean it is a big environment as a lot

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.410 
I mean it is a big environment as a lot
of<00:01:55.009> traffic<00:01:55.189> there's<00:01:55.549> a<00:01:55.609> lot<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.789> detail<00:01:56.240> its

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
of traffic there's a lot of detail its

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.649 
of traffic there's a lot of detail its
generating<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.039> for<00:01:58.310> Ubisoft<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.999> company

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
generating it so for Ubisoft a company

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.169 
generating it so for Ubisoft a company
that<00:01:59.840> doesn't<00:02:00.259> isn't<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.219> classical<00:02:01.729> racing

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
that doesn't isn't a classical racing

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.859 
that doesn't isn't a classical racing
company<00:02:03.490> certainly<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.670> way<00:02:05.299> better<00:02:05.509> than<00:02:05.749> I

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
company certainly it's way better than I

anyway<00:02:10.000> back<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.330> handling<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.050> yes<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.860> mean<00:02:12.070> if

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
anyway back to handling so yes I mean if

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.970 
anyway back to handling so yes I mean if
you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.460> compare<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.240> game<00:02:13.480> such<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
you can compare it to a game such as you

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.060 
you can compare it to a game such as you
know<00:02:15.270> ether<00:02:16.270> such<00:02:17.110> as<00:02:17.230> need<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.530> speed<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.920> run

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.920 
know ether such as need to speed the run
which<00:02:18.340> looked<00:02:18.580> dire<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.150> make<00:02:19.330> absolutely

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
which looked dire to make absolutely

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.170 
which looked dire to make absolutely
dire<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.560> mean<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> million<00:02:21.610> miles<00:02:21.820> past

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180

by the body language of the car remember

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.930 
by the body language of the car remember
it's<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.870> how<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.500> car<00:02:27.010> turns<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.670> about

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
it's not just how a car turns it's about

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's not just how a car turns it's about
how<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.210> rolls<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.750> suspension<00:02:29.530> and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
how it rolls like suspension and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
working here you know it seems to be

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.120 
working here you know it seems to be
very<00:02:33.400> playable<00:02:34.060> as<00:02:34.330> well<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.810> mean<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
still busting for everything so it shows

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.210

how intuitive this car is to control it
also<00:02:57.610> shows<00:02:57.820> as<00:02:57.970> well<00:02:58.000> he<00:02:58.240> gets<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> couple<00:02:58.600> of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
Tanks slappers on there you do need to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.220 
Tanks slappers on there you do need to
come<00:03:00.580> out<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.850> power<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.660> know<00:03:01.780> prevent<00:03:02.140> a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
come out the power you know prevent a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.990 
come out the power you know prevent a
bit<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.470> wheelspin<00:03:02.620> they<00:03:03.459> could<00:03:03.670> have<00:03:03.790> taken

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
bit of wheelspin they could have taken

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.699 
bit of wheelspin they could have taken
that<00:03:04.209> kind<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.630> detail<00:03:04.780> out<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.500> we'll<00:03:05.650> just

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
that kind of detail out and we'll just

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.050 
that kind of detail out and we'll just
made<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.490> put<00:03:06.670> your<00:03:06.760> finger

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
made it so that you just put your finger

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.220 
made it so that you just put your finger
down<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.420> you're<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.750> straight<00:03:08.020> line

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
down and you're going a straight line

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.530 
down and you're going a straight line
and<00:03:08.530> everything<00:03:08.920> sorts<00:03:09.670> itself<00:03:09.790> out<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.420> it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and everything sorts itself out so it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.890

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.920 
having a hands-on I don't know if that's
a<00:05:23.590> bad<00:05:23.770> sign<00:05:24.010> but<00:05:24.340> actually<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:25.120> have<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.780> say
