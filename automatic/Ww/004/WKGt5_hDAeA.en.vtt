00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.710
 despite the very young age 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.220
 track record and kovalchuk 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.100
 already enough wins and 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.559
 loud titles 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.889
 he is the junior world champion of the present 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.440
 of the year 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.110
 the best player is also the championship best 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.810
 championship final scorer 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.289
 the highest league of Russia 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.099
 It is therefore not surprising that the house 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.820
 by row 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.689
 Atlanta general manager 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.919
 taking advantage of their right 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.800
 top pick players on 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 draft 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
 did not miss the chance to get her into 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.050
 the team 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.940
 it turned out to score is 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.790
 and for me they saw and so 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 I saw preliminary lists 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330
 seemingly leads them 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.320
 show farm 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.350
 then came the funds 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.690
 most likely at the stadium they announced 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.380
 that the first number came out 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.340
 got mike singing 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.990
 just eat 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.780
 although he is engaged in seven years and already at 9 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.380
 noticed coaches from the Moscow dynamo 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.979
 young hockey players 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.219
 starts to train in 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.230
 Moscow 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 He has been a main player for 16 years. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.540
 Moscow Spartak 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.720
 on another contract with atlanta first works 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.540
 the right to offer your things contract 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.280
 plans 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.090
 that is, it belongs 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.090
 Russian business eight-year 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.880
 imperfection with navigator and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 compiled will run atlantic 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.409
 sports stress professionals 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 today draws parallels between 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.450
 Kovalchuk and Pavel the storm 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.800
 predicts not everywhere 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.870
 like a brown receiving colter 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.750
 triple 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.700
 of a prize handing mabat to the best league freshman 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.320
 reason for this is 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.219
 Kovalchuk is amazingly talented 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.340
 possesses gorgeous 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.700
 physical data 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.160
 how can it be laid out on 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.899
 training sessions 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.160
 we saw with our own eyes 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.360
 although Oleg himself does not consider this as so 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.520
 supernatural 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.720
 in spartacus and here in comparison with others 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.210
 the teams from the seven rf are not so 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 heavy loads on Slovak easy 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 the question was talking to the players of others 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 clubs there are completely different 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.049
 player adaptation in the new team process 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.050
 always painful enough 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.399
 what can we say to a foreign club 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.520
 idea mentality is different and the rule 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.229
 somewhat different 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.949
 yes language barrier still exists in 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.089
 Russia, this game has become a big family and all 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.569
 communicate with each other at this time 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.789
 accompanied created around 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.679
 houses 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.159
 June 10th 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.899
 you know I worked there matvienko 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.599
 I do not know a big family 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.409
 taking a different spot 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.319
 so maybe not worth run 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.280
 even though earnings at 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.629
 Russian hockey and defended 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.719
 not comparable for even larger denominations that 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.310
 there is money and feels consequence 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.999
 the fact that all intended measures if 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.629
 players are better before 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.680
 if you play and that means what 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.509
 reached hockey 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.569
 and of course it can't stop at 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.269
 anyway in some kind of life there 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.109
 concert passed 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.199
 so it does not change money is not the same 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.029
 important 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.629
 spending a few on the court 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.280
 months 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.869
 and I have already become fan favorites 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.840
 This is what the fans have been able to do with this. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.099
 I wish to be photographed with 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.260
 Russian hockey players 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 patiently waited and then after 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.859
 workout took an english lesson 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.119
 he is gorgeous tokyo if u 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.619
 we would have a couple more players 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:12.709
 such a level 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.249
 all doubts about the exit 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.079
 your post would have disappeared 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.529
 one more task sets itself 18 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:20.619
 summer hockey player 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.139
 join the Olympic 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.019
 ice hockey team and win in salt lake 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:24.709
 City 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.779
 but I will try 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.529
 during the reorganization of the plant first 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.099
 Kovalchuk plays under the 17th number 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.689
 when this number was associated with 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.589
 the great Valery Kharlamov 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.189
 dead in two years of birth 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.969
 we wish him to be worthy of his 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.299
 predecessor 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.260
 Dmitry rozhin Victor Pea ntv 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.509
 international atlanta
