let's take a bit stick a look at the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.350 
let's take a bit stick a look at the
graphics<00:02:38.489> card<00:02:40.310> yeah<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.760> answer<00:02:42.120> said<00:02:42.329> I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
graphics card yeah it's answer said I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.590

the<00:03:13.079> back<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> PCB<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.209> PCBs

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the back here it's just the PCB to PCBs

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.870 
the back here it's just the PCB to PCBs
blue<00:03:16.049> there's<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.829> little<00:03:17.100> slot<00:03:17.579> right<00:03:17.820> here

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
blue there's a little slot right here

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.479 
blue there's a little slot right here
where<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.299> connect<00:03:18.660> another<00:03:19.200> GPU<00:03:20.190> of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
where you can connect another GPU of

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.940 
where you can connect another GPU of
this<00:03:20.760> card<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.359> can<00:03:21.600> only<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:22.019> crossfire

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
this card so you can only do crossfire

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
this card so you can only do crossfire
with<00:03:23.250> two<00:03:23.400> cards<00:03:23.700> again<00:03:23.880> three<00:03:24.510> or<00:03:24.630> four<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
with two cards again three or four and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.099 
with two cards again three or four and
as<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.859> can<00:03:26.010> see<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.370> heat<00:03:26.910> sink<00:03:27.120> or<00:03:27.420> gluing

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
as you can see the heat sink or gluing

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.229 
as you can see the heat sink or gluing
design<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.560> actually<00:03:29.070> longer<00:03:29.310> than<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.790> PCB

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
design is actually longer than the PCB

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.349 
design is actually longer than the PCB
itself<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.739> which<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.430> measure<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.060> right

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
itself and which I measure that right

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:41.680 
itself and which I measure that right
now<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> length<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.980> video<00:03:35.250> card<00:03:35.549> is

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.180 

about<00:03:42.140> 10<00:03:42.710> inches<00:03:45.220> Wow<00:03:46.220> height<00:03:47.830> let's<00:03:48.830> move

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
about 10 inches Wow height let's move

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.590 
about 10 inches Wow height let's move
like<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.610> actually<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:52.490> height<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:53.120> the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
like this actually the height of the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.380 
like this actually the height of the
video<00:03:53.840> card<00:03:54.140> is<00:04:01.000> about<00:04:02.000> three<00:04:02.210> and<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.330> half

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
video card is about three and a half

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.150 
video card is about three and a half
inches<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.460> width<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:06.470> about<00:04:07.220> one<00:04:08.000> inch

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
inches and the width is about one inch

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.370 
inches and the width is about one inch
if<00:04:10.160> i'm<00:04:10.370> wrong<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:10.910> measuring<00:04:11.630> wrong<00:04:11.840> i'll<00:04:12.140> put

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
if i'm wrong or measuring wrong i'll put

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.740 
if i'm wrong or measuring wrong i'll put
like<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.620> little<00:04:13.030> text<00:04:14.030> down<00:04:14.210> here<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.630> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
like a little text down here of the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.070 
like a little text down here of the
correct<00:04:15.020> information<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.600> anyways<00:04:17.930> that's

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
correct information so anyways that's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.410 
correct information so anyways that's
the<00:04:18.230> graphics<00:04:18.650> card<00:04:18.940> okay<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.000> i'm<00:04:20.180> just<00:04:20.239> going

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
the graphics card okay so i'm just going

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.270 
the graphics card okay so i'm just going
to<00:04:20.480> compare<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.989> my<00:04:21.170> gtx<00:04:22.130> 275<00:04:24.010> from<00:04:25.010> p<00:04:25.160> and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
to compare this to my gtx 275 from p and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.060 
to compare this to my gtx 275 from p and
why<00:04:25.430> p<00:04:25.820> my<00:04:25.910> gtx<00:04:26.540> 275<00:04:27.010> had<00:04:28.420> 200<00:04:29.420> no<00:04:30.070> 896

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
why p my gtx 275 had 200 no 896

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.000 
why p my gtx 275 had 200 no 896
megabytes<00:04:31.640> love<00:04:31.850> me<00:04:32.720> Ram<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.470> was<00:04:33.710> good

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
megabytes love me Ram it was good

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.070 
megabytes love me Ram it was good
lasting<00:04:34.640> for<00:04:34.850> about<00:04:35.030> three<00:04:35.540> years<00:04:35.720> but<00:04:35.990> now

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
lasting for about three years but now

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.480 
lasting for about three years but now
it's<00:04:36.230> time<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.500> upgrade<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.860> something<00:04:37.160> better

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
it's time to upgrade to something better

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.510 
it's time to upgrade to something better
so<00:04:38.330> it's<00:04:38.510> just<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.750> little<00:04:39.020> comparison<00:04:39.890> of

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
so it's just a little comparison of

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.570 
so it's just a little comparison of
lengths<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.780> as<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.590> can<00:04:42.710> see<00:04:42.740> it's<00:04:43.100> actually

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
lengths and as you can see it's actually

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.330 
lengths and as you can see it's actually
pretty<00:04:43.700> much<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.090> same<00:04:44.360> length<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:46.220> to

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
pretty much the same length and it's to

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.770 
pretty much the same length and it's to
prove<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.780> length<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.620> card<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.780> 10

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
prove that the length this card is 10

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.610 
prove that the length this card is 10
inches<00:04:50.810> as<00:04:51.200> well<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.880> it'll<00:04:53.210> fit<00:04:53.600> on<00:04:53.720> my<00:04:53.930> rig

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
inches as well so it'll fit on my rig

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.420 
inches as well so it'll fit on my rig
perfectly<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:56.650> yeah<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.919> was<00:04:57.980> nice<00:04:58.250> having

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
perfectly and yeah it was nice having

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.280 
perfectly and yeah it was nice having
this<00:04:58.669> graphics<00:04:59.060> card<00:04:59.270> for<00:04:59.810> about<00:04:59.960> three<00:05:00.140> years

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
this graphics card for about three years

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.200 
this graphics card for about three years
but<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.620> know<00:05:00.800> like<00:05:01.520> I<00:05:01.610> said<00:05:01.820> it's<00:05:01.940> time<00:05:02.000> to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
but you know like I said it's time to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.930 
but you know like I said it's time to
upgrade<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.540> something<00:05:02.780> better<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:04.550> gigabyte

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
upgrade to something better the gigabyte

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.080 
upgrade to something better the gigabyte
