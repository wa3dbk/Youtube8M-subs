now<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:21.300> we're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.840> we're<00:00:22.529> going

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
now what we're going to do we're going

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.750 
now what we're going to do we're going
to<00:00:22.710> assemble<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:24.769> organizer<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.039> both<00:00:27.619> the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
to assemble the organizer on both the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.359 
to assemble the organizer on both the
shearing<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
shearing so this is a something of the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.420 
shearing so this is a something of the
shearing<00:00:36.170> once<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.350> assemble<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> shearing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
shearing once we assemble the shearing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.619 
shearing once we assemble the shearing
we<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> bring<00:00:40.200> our<00:00:40.559> soil<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:42.329> know

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
we are going to bring our soil we know

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.979 
we are going to bring our soil we know
this<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> compacted<00:00:44.010> sample<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this is a compacted sample we know the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
this is a compacted sample we know the
dry<00:00:46.289> density<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.879> moisture

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
dry density and we know the moisture

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.020 
dry density and we know the moisture
content<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.289> our<00:00:52.530> soil<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:53.910> going

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
content this is our soil so we're going

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.160 
content this is our soil so we're going
to<00:00:54.120> compact<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> soil<00:00:55.079> inside<00:00:56.239> in<00:00:57.239> layers<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to compact the soil inside in layers and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
to compact the soil inside in layers and
every<00:00:59.129> layer<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> check<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
every layer we're going to check the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
every layer we're going to check the
height<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.469> we're<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> check<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.430> much

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
height and we're going to check how much

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800 
height and we're going to check how much
material<00:01:04.070> we<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:05.909> putting<00:01:06.180> inside

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
material we have we are putting inside

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.429 
material we have we are putting inside
our<00:01:07.590> shearing<00:01:08.340> once<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
our shearing once now we're going to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
our shearing once now we're going to
compact<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.070> slightly<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.880> every<00:01:12.750> time

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
compact this slightly and every time

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.990 
compact this slightly and every time
we're<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> check<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> height<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.290> how

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
we're going to check the height and how

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
we're going to check the height and how
we<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.320> compacting<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> sample

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
we are compacting the sample

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.210 
we are compacting the sample
once<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.180> compacted<00:01:23.869> then<00:01:24.869> our<00:01:25.259> sample

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
once is all compacted then our sample

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.929 
once is all compacted then our sample
not<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.329> height<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.860> sample<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
not the height of the sample for this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.490 
not the height of the sample for this
particular<00:01:30.509> shearing<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.860> inch<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
particular shearing is one inch which is

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
particular shearing is one inch which is
25.4<00:01:34.670> millimeter<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.860 

so<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.690> know<00:01:41.840> exactly<00:01:41.990> how<00:01:42.560> much<00:01:43.090> soil<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.630> put

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
so we know exactly how much soil we put

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.580 
so we know exactly how much soil we put
inside<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:47.180> what<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.570> moisture<00:01:47.960> content<00:01:48.470> and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
inside and what to moisture content and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.120 
inside and what to moisture content and
the<00:01:49.430> dry<00:01:49.730> density<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.320> material

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
the dry density of the material

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.320 
the dry density of the material
for<00:01:52.850> any<00:01:53.090> excess<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:54.020> remove<00:01:54.460> make<00:01:55.460> sure<00:01:55.730> that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
for any excess we remove make sure that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.090 
for any excess we remove make sure that
the<00:01:56.540> surface<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.140> flat<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.340> level<00:02:00.100> just

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
the surface is flat and it level just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.600 
the surface is flat and it level just
need<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> little<00:02:01.550> bit<00:02:01.640> more<00:02:01.910> now<00:02:04.900> this<00:02:05.900> is<00:02:06.140> sand

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
need a little bit more now this is sand

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.730 
need a little bit more now this is sand
material<00:02:07.630> typically<00:02:08.630> run<00:02:08.960> these<00:02:09.140> tests<00:02:09.470> on

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
material typically run these tests on

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.140 
material typically run these tests on
same<00:02:10.520> material<00:02:11.150> or<00:02:12.280> granular<00:02:13.280> soil<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
same material or granular soil this is

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.430 
same material or granular soil this is
good<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.830> our<00:02:17.440> sample<00:02:18.440> inside<00:02:19.220> our

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
good so we have our sample inside our

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.480 
good so we have our sample inside our
shearing<00:02:21.440> now<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:23.150> clean<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.920> make<00:02:25.130> sure<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
shearing now we clean we make sure that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.360 
shearing now we clean we make sure that
everything<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.060> clean<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.220> we're

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
everything is clean here and then we're

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.350 
everything is clean here and then we're
going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> put<00:02:31.790> our<00:02:33.459> top

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
going to put our top

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.790 
going to put our top
porous<00:02:36.110> stone<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.960> then<00:02:39.790> our<00:02:40.790> top<00:02:41.450> cap<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
porous stone and then our top cap and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.590 
porous stone and then our top cap and
our<00:02:42.800> sample<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.700> ready<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.780> be<00:02:44.960> tested
