00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
all right so what we have here is a 97

easiest<00:00:10.110> ways<00:00:10.260> did<00:00:10.410> install<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> roll<00:00:10.889> pans<00:00:11.099> we

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
easiest ways did install a roll pans we

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.009 
easiest ways did install a roll pans we
figured<00:00:12.059> why<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.269> give<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> little<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
figured why not give it a little a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
figured why not give it a little a
little<00:00:13.110> bit<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.440> video<00:00:13.610> there's<00:00:14.610> two<00:00:14.790> ways

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
little bit of a video there's two ways

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.840 
little bit of a video there's two ways
to<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.150> install<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> first<00:00:23.160> step<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
to do install so the first step is to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.849 
to do install so the first step is to
get<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> sharpie<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> mark<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> bedside

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
get a sharpie and mark on the bedside

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
get a sharpie and mark on the bedside
when<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> bottom<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> tailgate<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
when the bottom of the tailgate is that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
when the bottom of the tailgate is that
way<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> distance<00:00:29.070> between<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
way you can see the distance between it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
way you can see the distance between it
and<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> roll<00:00:30.300> pan<00:00:30.510> next<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> go

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and the roll pan next you want to go

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.530 
and the roll pan next you want to go
ahead<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.949> take<00:00:32.099> off<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.309> tailgate<00:00:32.850> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
ahead and take off your tailgate that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.270 
ahead and take off your tailgate that
way<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> could<00:00:33.989> easily<00:00:34.200> install<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> top

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
way you could easily install the top

fit the roll pan to make sure that it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
fit the roll pan to make sure that it
