Andy<00:01:33.840> knows<00:01:34.259> um<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.729> your

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Andy knows um you know what your

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
Andy knows um you know what your
pointers<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.360> yeah<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.560> great<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> think

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
pointers are yeah it was great I think

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
pointers are yeah it was great I think
for<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> biggest<00:01:39.240> thing<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.600> just

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for me the biggest thing was just

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.380 
for me the biggest thing was just
loosening<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.369> direction<00:01:41.939> whose<00:01:42.119> great

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
loosening up the direction whose great

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
loosening up the direction whose great
direction<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.110> helps<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.710> because

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
direction really helps a lot because

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
direction really helps a lot because
really<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> photographer<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.229> angles

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really the photographer can see angles

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
really the photographer can see angles
better<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.210> model<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
better than the model can so that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.280 
better than the model can so that
