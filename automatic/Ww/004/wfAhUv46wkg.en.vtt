00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.490
 Let's go 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.460
 Now he has the chance 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.570
 drive her quietly 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 he sits 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 that's the 1 0 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.230
 and now we can discuss it 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.269
 which was well done or was it easy 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.300
 I defend myself badly 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.859
 imagine the coach is going crazy 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.619
 there you work the whole week 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.449
 of course, also on your defensive and 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.829
 then your opponent is so free 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.559
 the box the maximum picture differently 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.720
 or not the dream start and now 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.720
 It means to keep doing it 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.360
 there is the red box from the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.640
 impartially 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.859
 as the user looks a little weird 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 but the gesture is unmistakable 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:59.300
 he needs the space and is again since 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.429
 it happens 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 now they have made the compensation 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.500
 on which they are printed 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 have a very strong performance and if you do 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.290
 ask me who will do the thing here 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.470
 win the end 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.140
 one is currently trend 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.810
 this team you have him 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.600
 really invited to this gate 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.870
 that was hard on the border to the blackout 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.050
 how can that be that a third 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.640
 attacker so free in front of the box too 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.220
 do 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.010
 it starts again from the beginning 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.000
 the punishment is the contact 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.280
 to separate the Schwerin from the ball 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 Opportunity is there alone 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.700
 that could be turned ice cold 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.810
 incredible comeback qualities that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.810
 this team has 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:01.479
 icy cold past the baffled gate 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.200
 Situations are exactly the same 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.299
 imagine that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.130
 that went pretty fast 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.960
 ball came from behind he immediately got the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.399
 recognized situation has prevailed 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.399
 and has put forward his 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 good dribbling more without success no 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.360
 gate 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.360
 that was the final whistle sounded
