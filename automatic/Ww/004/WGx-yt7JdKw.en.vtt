and<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> starts<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> fall<00:01:24.830> well<00:01:26.030> yesterday<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and it starts to fall well yesterday I

and it starts to fall well yesterday I
had<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.799> brainstorm<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.079> thought<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:31.979> i

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
had a brainstorm and I thought how can i

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
had a brainstorm and I thought how can i
get<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.900> stand<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> device<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.900> i

get this stand on to this device and i

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710 
get this stand on to this device and i
thought<00:01:37.380> well<00:01:37.640> why<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.820> i<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.909> flip<00:01:39.689> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
thought well why don't i just flip it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
thought well why don't i just flip it
over<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.490> i<00:01:42.770> got<00:01:43.770> those<00:01:43.920> qo<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.869> i<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
over so i got those qo out and i put the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.670 
over so i got those qo out and i put the
stand<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.340> sure<00:01:50.340> enough

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
stand on there like that and sure enough

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.929 
stand on there like that and sure enough
when<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.869> when<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.899> attach<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.740> stand<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
when you when you attach the stand on to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
when you when you attach the stand on to
the<00:01:57.030> oqo<00:01:58.189> like<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.490> it<00:02:00.180> creates<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.259> perfect

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the oqo like that it creates a perfect

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.720 
the oqo like that it creates a perfect
angle

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.330 

to<00:02:06.090> prop<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.890> plus<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.760> stand<00:02:09.090> folds<00:02:10.020> back

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to prop it up plus the stand folds back

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.980 
to prop it up plus the stand folds back
so<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.490> there's<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.940> stand<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.780> folds

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
so there there's the stand and it folds

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350 
so there there's the stand and it folds
back<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.490> does<00:02:14.850> create<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
back as you can see it does create a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
back as you can see it does create a
little<00:02:15.810> bit<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.350> lip<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> not<00:02:19.980> as

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
little bit of a lip there so it's not as

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.720 
little bit of a lip there so it's not as
flush<00:02:20.600> now<00:02:21.600> yeah<00:02:22.230> oqo<00:02:23.070> wanted<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.610> do

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
flush now yeah oqo wanted to do

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.310 
flush now yeah oqo wanted to do
something<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:24.960> could<00:02:25.170> make

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
something like this they could make

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.140 
something like this they could make
their<00:02:25.380> battery<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.960> snag<00:02:27.960> bit<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.970> tad

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
their battery just a snag bit just a tad

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.470 
their battery just a snag bit just a tad
bit<00:02:30.180> bigger<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:32.550> could<00:02:32.760> flush<00:02:33.120> mount

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
we've got a built-in stand for the oqo

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.529 
we've got a built-in stand for the oqo
and<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:09.520> closes<00:06:10.090> up<00:06:11.069> just<00:06:12.069> hunky-dory<00:06:13.060> there

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
and it closes up just hunky-dory there

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.140 
and it closes up just hunky-dory there
look<00:06:13.750> at<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:13.930> just<00:06:14.500> beautiful<00:06:14.909> can<00:06:15.909> you<00:06:16.000> guys

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
slide that up and I can use it like that

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.719 
slide that up and I can use it like that
if<00:06:43.509> I<00:06:43.630> want<00:06:43.900> or<00:06:44.169> I<00:06:44.949> can<00:06:45.909> get<00:06:46.120> my<00:06:47.310> thang<00:06:48.310> outside

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
when I got my mouth so I can use that

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.300 
when I got my mouth so I can use that
too<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:56.770> I've<00:06:56.949> got<00:06:57.039> a<00:06:57.219> nice<00:06:58.770> work<00:06:59.770> station

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
too and I've got a nice work station

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.999 
too and I've got a nice work station
that's<00:07:01.060> going<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.360> work<00:07:01.539> just<00:07:01.840> great<00:07:02.650> so

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
that's going to work just great so

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.610 
that's going to work just great so
anyway<00:07:03.280> that's<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.389> built-in<00:07:04.840> stand<00:07:05.110> for<00:07:05.469> the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
anyway that's the built-in stand for the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.749 
anyway that's the built-in stand for the
oqo<00:07:06.219> i<00:07:06.550> will<00:07:07.419> post<00:07:07.599> a<00:07:07.870> link<00:07:07.900> to<00:07:08.440> the<00:07:08.889> think

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
oqo i will post a link to the think

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.450 
oqo i will post a link to the think
outside<00:07:10.150> stowaway<00:07:10.659> keyboard<00:07:11.110> and<00:07:11.319> if<00:07:12.039> oqo

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
outside stowaway keyboard and if oqo

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.020 
outside stowaway keyboard and if oqo
wants<00:07:12.880> to<00:07:13.030> begin<00:07:14.219> making<00:07:15.219> their<00:07:15.430> battery<00:07:15.789> just

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
wants to begin making their battery just

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.589 
wants to begin making their battery just
a<00:07:16.210> teeny<00:07:16.780> bit<00:07:17.050> bigger<00:07:17.380> so<00:07:17.680> that<00:07:18.389> they<00:07:19.389> could

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 
a teeny bit bigger so that they could

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.600 
a teeny bit bigger so that they could
create<00:07:19.990> a<00:07:20.050> stand<00:07:20.500> just<00:07:20.710> like<00:07:20.800> this<00:07:21.159> that'll

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
create a stand just like this that'll

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
create a stand just like this that'll
float<00:07:21.909> light<00:07:22.569> inside<00:07:22.900> the<00:07:23.080> battery<00:07:24.630> you'll

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630 
float light inside the battery you'll

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.170 
float light inside the battery you'll
make<00:07:25.750> a<00:07:25.779> lot<00:07:26.050> of<00:07:26.110> folks<00:07:26.349> happy<00:07:26.560> now<00:07:27.190> I<00:07:27.460> will

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
make a lot of folks happy now I will

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.470 
make a lot of folks happy now I will
point<00:07:28.389> out<00:07:28.570> that<00:07:28.870> there<00:07:29.169> is<00:07:29.349> a<00:07:29.789> executive

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480 
point out that there is a executive

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.650 
point out that there is a executive
the<00:07:31.540> executive<00:07:32.350> case<00:07:32.620> actually<00:07:33.550> has<00:07:34.090> a<00:07:34.120> cover

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
the executive case actually has a cover

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.020 
the executive case actually has a cover
that<00:07:34.780> goes<00:07:35.230> over<00:07:35.290> the<00:07:35.680> top<00:07:35.710> and<00:07:36.160> when<00:07:36.940> you

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
that goes over the top and when you

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.280 
that goes over the top and when you
float<00:07:37.330> it<00:07:37.540> back<00:07:37.860> it<00:07:38.860> it<00:07:39.670> creates<00:07:40.030> a<00:07:40.540> stand<00:07:41.050> that

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
float it back it it creates a stand that

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.370 
float it back it it creates a stand that
can<00:07:41.560> float<00:07:41.980> at<00:07:42.190> two<00:07:42.400> different<00:07:42.550> angles

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
can float at two different angles

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.270 
can float at two different angles
unfortunately<00:07:44.380> it<00:07:44.470> only<00:07:44.500> works<00:07:44.890> with<00:07:45.100> this

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 
unfortunately it only works with this

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.060 
unfortunately it only works with this
with<00:07:46.000> the<00:07:46.120> standard<00:07:46.540> capacity<00:07:46.690> battery<00:07:47.410> so<00:07:48.040> it

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
with the standard capacity battery so it

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.680 
with the standard capacity battery so it
would<00:07:48.400> not<00:07:48.430> work<00:07:48.940> it<00:07:49.240> would<00:07:49.390> not<00:07:49.540> be<00:07:49.660> a

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.690 
would not work it would not be a

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.110 
would not work it would not be a
solution<00:07:50.050> if<00:07:50.350> you<00:07:50.530> use<00:07:51.040> the<00:07:51.340> double<00:07:51.970> capacity

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 
solution if you use the double capacity

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.690 
solution if you use the double capacity
battery<00:07:52.780> like<00:07:52.990> I<00:07:53.170> do<00:07:53.230> I<00:07:53.560> think<00:07:54.160> they<00:07:54.280> sell<00:07:54.520> that

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.700 
battery like I do I think they sell that

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.470 
battery like I do I think they sell that
executive<00:07:55.240> case<00:07:55.480> for<00:07:55.750> like<00:07:55.900> fifty<00:07:56.320> nine<00:07:56.440> bucks

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:57.480 
executive case for like fifty nine bucks

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.390 
executive case for like fifty nine bucks
but<00:07:58.480> that<00:07:58.600> is<00:07:58.780> another<00:07:58.930> option<00:07:59.260> for<00:07:59.530> creating

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 
but that is another option for creating

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.060 
but that is another option for creating
a<00:08:00.550> stand<00:08:00.940> so<00:08:01.300> now<00:08:01.990> i<00:08:02.020> have<00:08:02.350> my<00:08:02.380> permanently

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.070 
a stand so now i have my permanently

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.620 
a stand so now i have my permanently
attached<00:08:03.460> stand<00:08:03.790> and<00:08:04.260> i<00:08:05.260> am<00:08:05.770> a<00:08:05.800> happy<00:08:06.280> camper

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:06.630 
attached stand and i am a happy camper

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.810 
attached stand and i am a happy camper
take<00:08:07.630> care
