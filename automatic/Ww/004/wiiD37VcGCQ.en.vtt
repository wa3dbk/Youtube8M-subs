00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.510
 hello to all and cocof is decidedly 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.880
 the weekend was auspicious since I 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.210
 come back with a new master replay 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.950
 this time the maho this so the tanks 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.020
 heavy German of rank 10 the other tanks 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.039
 heavy of this type there being the blood but 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.380
 the change is not so Morocco is 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.210
 a very nice tank is the charles more 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.220
 heavy of the game so you can bring back 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 tanks admired when the husband without 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.510
 want to do a lot of damage 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.010
 he has an armor really really 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.579
 monstrous for whatever they are 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.229
 correctly english I do not know how 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.530
 the steilhang face made to flow 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.629
 I missed this detail during the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.519
 part 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.079
 ah yes respect yes which 6 there is a small 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:53.260
 lake but really was quickly dismissed 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.690
 so the way aspect is so the foam 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 it's really the urban tank by 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.879
 Excellency 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.210
 the caricom take out a master with this 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.530
 chariot on a hand covered respect because 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.479
 that good me I can really play 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.450
 only in urban mode or there really 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.909
 excelle sitemapping is really is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.580
 really perfect for that so that's where 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.350
 that they make the best use of their main 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 is almost the only quality that is his 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.659
 household knowing that its alpha is a 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.720
 alpha 2 490 so here's points 3/4 says 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.369
 it's still a bit light so what 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.009
 good it's not and not really there for 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.130
 to make the damage he is especially there we go 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.560
 to say yet that is stretched opponent 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.679
 to push for to help his team 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.270
 to advance the coup good the master is not 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.799
 very very high in terms of damage but 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.479
 until now I had not managed to 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.190
 take it out 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.630
 so I got there by the middle of 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.860
 the map 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 so I choose got there because 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.049
 that it is she who puts it as soon as possible 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.799
 in urban so and I remember 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.130
 really the environment in which Morocco 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.719
 is excellent 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.280
 and so I can want them by the side 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.060
 because it was a blow presented his 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.380
 flank to all enemy tanks 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.510
 posted in level hill and its 9 0 good 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.780
 I am aiming at the low cost of being 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 but hey I think I want it to go 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 anyway it's not happened 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.330
 the same so here I am climbing 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.910
 I try to touch the crate but that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.470
 not pass I 'm shifting a little bit of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.610
 my colleague in Kerhorre to try to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.820
 do not play hard right and with him 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.590
 the psg is not feeling there we are going 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.810
 stay opposing trying to recover a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 angle but good there's no and not big 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.480
 thing possibly so tried to m 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.580
 goad killer of the crate and the turret 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 it's going to pass then as I see it 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.450
 is really really life 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.790
 I pass on an ax and I do not embark 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.450
 not masses but frankly for 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.490
 get out the ft1 it could be royal good 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.160
 so I have it 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.460
 shoot the conqueror it's not it's 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.810
 not great for me that this is safe 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.370
 some damage that about half 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.990
 of my nominal is better than nothing good 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.420
 I stayed on an ax or in case 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:21.660
 but hey that's not really the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.980
 ideal ammunition on this tank try to 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.010
 locate if I have not so on some 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.010
 thing 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.450
 so as I see that my colleague 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.459
 good there he just took a shot but 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.739
 there are a lot of people in the street at the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 left 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.950
 this is someone who just farted me 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.300
 the caterpillars I snap the clip because 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.160
 that there really is not to be paid for 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.320
 stay in the middle here is typically 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 the sk talent taut curtains of words 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.450
 give a 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.730
 the box of conch errors but good at 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.560
 the ax does a lot of damage 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.950
 the next one on peace he'll take 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.950
 very expensive 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.660
 I continue to advance not introduce myself 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.660
 not be sustainable from the street 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.750
 unfortunately he had time to get 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.610
 fold I did not want to try a shot of 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 chott hautmont disappears because 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.480
 really the reload time is good it is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.710
 okay but here it is 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.040
 long enough monti rails a hundredth of 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.630
 second 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 after that one colleagues what makes that 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.360
 I'm doing it he otherwise I could have it 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.900
 do it before for the out 75 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.010
 happens to cross I aim at the bottom of 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.300
 crate but as he got 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.070
 intelligently in English it's not 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.870
 passed me I can also search 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.110
 assembly or just to stand in all 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.170
 case it allowed him to avoid my shot from 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.060
 the to do it ding and here is the 75 hp 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.890
 go out from behind blow my next 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.270
 priority target to rise 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.400
 I made the side passage and my 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.350
 colleague made him the caterpillars so 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.640
 that's nickel 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.130
 and so I go forward to put in 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.500
 sai scripting position or a can 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.690
 nothing to do anymore and as long as I do 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.660
 takes advantage for the father clubbing history 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.340
 to ensure damage without risk 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.320
 always happy and it's always 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.810
 annoying for the beak at 45.02 crutches 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.730
 with his canvas completely the back is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.390
 excellent in title and ping as the mar 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.770
 up but that's it as soon as it's up 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.060
 that they get bludgeoned it is 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.760
 really environment a position at the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.980
 con it can really do anything so I 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.870
 bar and enjoy it 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.460
 the trouble had the time to repair that I 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.070
 their do the caterpillars so here I 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.080
 advance me for laura but yeah for a 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.540
 few in the maneuver suddenly I do not 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.100
 would finish loach are functional 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.449
 that's not complicated we will not do it again 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.010
 a work with the con enough to go out 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.150
 so here I spot quickly so 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.550
 the escat and the other side of the wall 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.910
 it's not a good target laly and 7 who 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.400
 this flank recoil it's royal not going the 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.580
 let it get out next target on 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.930
 the table the conqueror so they me 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.600
 beautifully show on this flank of 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.020
 turrets here are now healed life 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.570
 back of turrets joke like a 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.760
 easy frag so here I will have two 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.490
 possibilities either leave cap and either 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.460
 leave on the left flank are there low 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.550
 the authorities of the surviving opponents 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.810
 I prefer to leave on the left good 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.860
 that's the risk is to be 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.590
 circle but I still still 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.060
 mass of pv I have a bit of what to see 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.830
 come 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.130
 good there art ti was spots and I try 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.900
 to recover an angle here if there is 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.210
 way to carry the kill but hey 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.030
 is not the case so I focus 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.370
 quickly on the suites 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.750
 I live well the rocker that passes 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.550
 well a little jewish and caterpillars that's 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.090
 royal 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.950
 I'm getting closer I'm trying to 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.860
 intercept him see if there is way to the 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.040
 unfortunately bring back this visit I 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.530
 am not damage 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.860
 and I go out without end without problem so 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:01.040
 I have a sk t1 stb 1 in the alley on 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.190
 my left to think I go in 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.190
 the heap 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.750
 I had to turn it 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.150
 come out the means of quick shot at 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.570
 passage unfortunately time to 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.490
 flee 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.810
 pl loris it was the escape wait for me 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.430
 at the turn but no they were turned 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.660
 their direction so I advance to see if 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.050
 a way of their friends if they continue 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.820
 to go back 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.230
 unfortunately no and it was good and 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.110
 who put on my side so especially 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:32.400
 I do not stop dsk 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.620
 yes it slips 4 is quiet 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.830
 the stb takes the opportunity to put a shot 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.010
 so I put myself best at the best face 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.410
 to both stb 1 and as the other to art 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.320
 to bring the mine of a cheetah 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.990
 the left I wait for it at the turn 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.580
 literally knowing that if the other stb 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.390
 h for maybe see her good 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.340
 unfortunately there is this 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.950
 come out and the other blow to the air 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.230
 much less hot to come so 

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.360
 here I am counting on the fact that is going to be 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.950
 pushed by my colleagues I do not fit 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.550
 right away in the cap area for 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.170
 not scare him 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:09.750
 and when I see that he approaches me 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:11.910
 advance me and white so here is finally the 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.340
 little masters what is fun on 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.510
 the bar rise thank you for having followed this 

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.870
 video see you soon for a next 

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.870
 I hope
