to<00:04:03.590> start<00:04:03.830> off<00:04:03.950> by<00:04:04.160> spraying<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.610> insides<00:04:05.150> of

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
to start off by spraying the insides of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:15.400 
to start off by spraying the insides of
the<00:04:05.420> jars<00:04:05.690> with<00:04:05.900> glue

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.020 

next<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.530> am<00:04:16.889> taking<00:04:17.220> some<00:04:17.250> different<00:04:17.760> colored

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
next I am taking some different colored

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.449 
next I am taking some different colored
tubes<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.510> glitter<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.139> pouring<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.950> decent

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
tubes of glitter and pouring a decent

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:29.930 
tubes of glitter and pouring a decent
amount<00:04:20.519> into<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.389> jar<00:04:28.430> before<00:04:29.430> popping<00:04:29.850> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
amount into the jar before popping the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.240 
amount into the jar before popping the
lid<00:04:30.090> back<00:04:30.240> on<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.630> giving<00:04:31.169> them<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.470> good<00:04:31.919> shake

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
lid back on and giving them a good shake

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.100 
lid back on and giving them a good shake
so<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> glitter<00:04:33.150> spreads<00:04:33.570> nice<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
so that the glitter spreads nice and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.180 
so that the glitter spreads nice and
even<00:04:38.450> then<00:04:39.450> unscrew<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.260> lid<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.590> pour<00:04:41.010> out

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
even then unscrew the lid and pour out

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.670 
even then unscrew the lid and pour out
the<00:04:41.220> excess<00:04:41.760> glitter<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.320> I<00:04:43.320> would<00:04:43.530> suggest

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
the excess glitter and I would suggest

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.500 
the excess glitter and I would suggest
leaving<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> jars<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.639> completely<00:04:45.240> dry<00:04:45.480> for

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
leaving the jars to completely dry for

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.810 
leaving the jars to completely dry for
about<00:04:45.900> an<00:04:46.050> hour<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:46.560> before<00:04:47.160> placing<00:04:47.729> your

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
