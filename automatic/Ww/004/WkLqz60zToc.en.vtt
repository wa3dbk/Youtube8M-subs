how<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> do<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.900> water<00:00:14.090> simulation<00:00:15.090> now<00:00:15.900> I've

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
how to do a water simulation now I've

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.190 
how to do a water simulation now I've
got<00:00:16.619> blender<00:00:17.070> up<00:00:17.279> sit<00:00:18.060> took<00:00:18.270> too<00:00:18.660> long<00:00:18.689> last

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
got blender up sit took too long last

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.929 
got blender up sit took too long last
time<00:00:20.570> sorry<00:00:22.010> right<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.520> teach

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you how to make a water simulation it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.030 
you how to make a water simulation it
should<00:00:27.570> work<00:00:27.720> last<00:00:28.110> time<00:00:28.200> I<00:00:28.380> did<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> didn't

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
should work last time I did it didn't

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.640 
should work last time I did it didn't
work<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.759> reason<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.930> we<00:00:31.259> are<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
work for some reason so we are going to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.819 
work for some reason so we are going to
use<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.009> default<00:00:32.220> cube<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.680> we're

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
use the default cube this time so we're

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.240 
use the default cube this time so we're
going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> s<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:37.770> size<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:39.949> little<00:00:40.949> bit

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
going to s to size it up a little bit

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.060 
going to s to size it up a little bit
move<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.539> now<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.739> need<00:00:43.949> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
move it down there now what we need to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
move it down there now what we need to
do<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.780> add<00:00:45.780> another<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.519> said<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.510> care

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
do is add another one so it said to care

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.459 
do is add another one so it said to care
into<00:00:48.960> wireframe<00:00:49.170> mode<00:00:49.620> add<00:00:50.000> mesh<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.840> do

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
into wireframe mode add mesh you can do

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.349 
into wireframe mode add mesh you can do
whatever<00:00:52.679> you<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.429> actually<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.269> I'm

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
whatever you like I'm actually now I'm

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.919 
whatever you like I'm actually now I'm
not<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.019> gonna<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> comb<00:00:56.929> so

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
not going to do I'm gonna do a comb so

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.819 
not going to do I'm gonna do a comb so
rotate<00:00:59.749> make<00:01:00.749> it<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.019> other<00:01:01.050> way<00:01:01.320> around<00:01:01.379> up

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
rotate make it the other way around up

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.730 
rotate make it the other way around up
sorry<00:01:02.640> wrong<00:01:02.940> one

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740

so<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:12.600> cone<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.170> I've<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.760> my<00:01:14.760> box

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so I've got my cone and I've got my box

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.130 
so I've got my cone and I've got my box
so<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.620> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.160> need<00:01:17.310> eye<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.810> can't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so now we're going to need eye you can't

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.540 
so now we're going to need eye you can't
see<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.010> don't<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
see all the things I don't know what

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.880 
see all the things I don't know what
matters<00:01:20.910> so<00:01:21.300> we're<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.530> into<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
matters so we're going to go into the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.150 
matters so we're going to go into the
physics<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:25.190> Tad<00:01:26.190> here<00:01:26.460> we're<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.120> um

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
physics and Tad here we're gonna um

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.480 
physics and Tad here we're gonna um
right-click<00:01:29.160> right<00:01:29.850> click<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.540> cube<00:01:31.490> fluid

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
right-click right click the cube fluid

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.380 
right-click right click the cube fluid
add<00:01:33.470> domain<00:01:35.120> right<00:01:36.120> click<00:01:36.510> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:38.030> cone<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
add domain right click on the cone and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.000 
add domain right click on the cone and
get<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.870> fluid<00:01:40.740> add<00:01:41.090> fluid<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.830> is

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
get a fluid add fluid I think this is

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.240 
get a fluid add fluid I think this is
right<00:01:44.600> now<00:01:45.600> um<00:01:48.110> like<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.770> we're<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.070> go

see I've just played it back to see what
it's<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:51.660> water<00:02:51.900> simulation

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
it's like so this is my water simulation

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.160 
it's like so this is my water simulation
it<00:02:53.250> will<00:02:53.520> already<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.030> animated<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.080> you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it will already have animated it for you

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.370 
it will already have animated it for you
so<00:02:55.710> we're<00:02:55.830> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> hit<00:02:56.700> dead<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.870> go<00:02:58.050> into

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
so we're going to hit dead to go into

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.710 
so we're going to hit dead to go into
the<00:02:58.530> frame<00:02:58.950> mode<00:02:59.160> now<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.910> big<00:03:00.150> cube<00:03:00.540> we

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the frame mode now this big cube we

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.860 
the frame mode now this big cube we
don't<00:03:00.960> need<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:04.250> cube<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:06.150> we're<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.810> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
don't need so cube and we're going to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.980 
don't need so cube and we're going to
pick<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> eye<00:03:07.530> there<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.540> don't<00:03:09.780> need<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
pick the eye there so you don't need it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:18.770 
pick the eye there so you don't need it
now<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.770> won't<00:03:11.160> see<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:16.580> all<00:03:17.580> right<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.570> do

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
now you won't see that all right we do

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.030 
now you won't see that all right we do
need<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.260> cube<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:23.280> one<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:23.760> don't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
need that cube it's that one we don't

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.690 
need that cube it's that one we don't
that's<00:03:26.040> better

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that's better

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.120 
that's better
right<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.020> go<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.650> back<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.890> is

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
right so if we go to the back so this is

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.250 
right so if we go to the back so this is
what<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.580> going<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.850> look<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:34.020> add

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
what it's going to look like you can add

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.850 
what it's going to look like you can add
stuff<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.239> basically<00:03:36.510> forced<00:03:37.350> her<00:03:37.560> floor

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
stuff so it basically forced her floor

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.590 
stuff so it basically forced her floor
and<00:03:38.550> that's<00:03:38.760> simply<00:03:39.600> what<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.650> this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
and that's simply what it is this

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.030 
and that's simply what it is this
simulation<00:03:42.600> now<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.320> can<00:03:43.470> cut<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.800> down

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
simulation now you can cut this down

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.750 
simulation now you can cut this down
like<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.340> knife<00:03:45.769> how<00:03:46.769> long<00:03:46.950> does<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.160> last<00:03:47.280> first

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.130 

right<00:03:53.760> okay<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.209> we're<00:03:54.570> going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> cut<00:03:54.930> out

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
right okay so we're going to cut out

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.229 
right okay so we're going to cut out
right<00:03:56.100> now<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.850> need<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.209> add<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:59.280> we

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
right now we just need to add this we

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.390 
right now we just need to add this we
need<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.750> make<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.769> color<00:04:02.239> good<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:04.400> like

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
need to make the color good there I like

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.430 
need to make the color good there I like
that<00:04:05.459> color<00:04:07.640> one<00:04:11.750> right<00:04:12.750> I'm<00:04:13.110> going<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.350> go

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
that color one right I'm going to go

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.229 
that color one right I'm going to go
down<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:15.290> transparency<00:04:16.880> see<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:20.239> just

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
down here on transparency see the just

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.930 
down here on transparency see the just
mess<00:04:21.810> around<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> settings<00:04:22.950> till<00:04:23.790> you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
mess around with the settings till you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.809 
mess around with the settings till you
get<00:04:24.120> what<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.390> like<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.870> mirror

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.909 

alright<00:04:32.819> so<00:04:33.030> I've<00:04:33.120> got<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.449> now<00:04:34.379> I've<00:04:34.800> got<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
alright so I've got it now I've got it

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.920 
alright so I've got it now I've got it
so<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.280> don't<00:04:38.520> want<00:04:38.849> to<00:04:39.000> see<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.330> cube<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so I don't want to see that cube in the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.040 
so I don't want to see that cube in the
beginning<00:04:41.599> okay<00:04:42.599> so<00:04:42.930> if<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.169> cut<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.680> their

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
beginning okay so if I cut to their

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.680 
beginning okay so if I cut to their
start<00:04:46.400> where<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> might<00:04:47.699> at<00:04:47.759> the<00:04:47.849> moment<00:04:48.210> start

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
start where I might at the moment start

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.809 
start where I might at the moment start
to<00:04:49.340> when<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.430> play<00:04:50.759> it<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.599> starts<00:04:52.020> from<00:04:52.169> -<00:04:52.819> okay

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
to when I play it it starts from - okay

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.260 
to when I play it it starts from - okay
brilliant<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.919> then<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.099> should<00:04:56.340> stop<00:04:56.759> so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
brilliant and then it should stop so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.240 
brilliant and then it should stop so
that<00:04:57.419> I'm<00:04:57.509> going<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.810> render<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.349> now<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:59.159> I'm

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
that I'm going to render that now so I'm

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.520 
that I'm going to render that now so I'm
going<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.460> go<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.940> camera<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:00.509> I'm<00:05:01.319> going

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
going to go to the camera here I'm going

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.830 
going to go to the camera here I'm going
to<00:05:01.620> go<00:05:01.919> down<00:05:02.129> here<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.520> don't<00:05:02.819> want<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.090> be<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> PNG

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
to go down here I don't want to be a PNG

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.860 
to go down here I don't want to be a PNG
because<00:05:04.289> then<00:05:04.590> there'll<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.860> tons<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.370> photos

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
because then there'll be tons of photos

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.510 
because then there'll be tons of photos
not<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.199> movie<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.159> I'm<00:05:08.220> gonna<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.759> be<00:05:08.970> codec

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
not a movie so I'm gonna a be codec

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.420 
not a movie so I'm gonna a be codec
performance<00:05:18.380> right<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.830> should<00:05:20.009> be<00:05:20.130> okay

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
performance right that should be okay

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.850 
performance right that should be okay
now<00:05:20.699> I<00:05:20.940> want<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.419> choose<00:05:21.810> where<00:05:21.990> I'm<00:05:22.110> gonna<00:05:22.289> do

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
now I want to choose where I'm gonna do

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.550 
now I want to choose where I'm gonna do
it<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> don't<00:05:23.219> want<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.699> put<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> there<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.599> want

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
it I don't want to put it there I want

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.260 
it I don't want to put it there I want
to<00:05:25.650> put<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.219> on<00:05:26.990> desk<00:05:27.990> top<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.129> I'm<00:05:30.030> gonna

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
to put it on desk top and I'm gonna

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.730 
to put it on desk top and I'm gonna
accept<00:05:31.020> there<00:05:31.560> so<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:32.009> I'm<00:05:32.250> ready<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:33.740> render

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
accept there so now I'm ready to render

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.089 
accept there so now I'm ready to render
the<00:05:34.979> animation<00:05:35.069> so<00:05:35.699> I'm<00:05:35.789> gonna<00:05:35.940> render<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.360> now

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
the animation so I'm gonna render it now

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.459 
the animation so I'm gonna render it now
this<00:05:38.099> is<00:05:38.159> simply<00:05:39.120> you<00:05:39.419> can<00:05:39.630> see<00:05:39.870> it's<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.199> the

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
this is simply you can see it's not the

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.640 
this is simply you can see it's not the
best<00:05:40.710> because<00:05:41.669> there's<00:05:42.270> still<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.990> lot<00:05:43.229> of<00:05:43.259> flat

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
best because there's still a lot of flat

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.409 
best because there's still a lot of flat
surfaces<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:45.830> vertices<00:05:46.830> so<00:05:47.729> that's<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.300> end

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
surfaces and vertices so that's the end
