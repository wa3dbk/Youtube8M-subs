 martijn what is it like to be back 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.850
 Yes amazing 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.139
 really really nice to stand here how 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.880
 did it work that way yes me me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.960
 didn't leave when I was 19 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 made the small detour and 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.460
 eventually via finding a comb 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 neighbors 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.939
 by coming back here when has fc 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.380
 Groningen interest in you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.060
 when it really specifically say 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.170
 it will play there for a while I know 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 not exactly how long a role plays 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.359
 but that has of course been around for a long time 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 when the time comes you have that shirt again 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.780
 yeah really really nice what you know 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.719
 still say about you but that was the neighborhood 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 January 2008 er ne sait house yes true 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.680
 yes what else do I know is yes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.910
 able to the under voltage if it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 trainer you send the cloth car to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 warming up and ultimately 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 after all, you have to get ready to go 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 play 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 so one and if tensions but they do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 it die than go but it was 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.539
 also not that long because the dogs 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.129
 wanted vvv you have to leave then you go away 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.780
 to Veendam you have something like that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.489
 okay maybe another way 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 in the end i could just go back 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 yes I then almost immediately there 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.119
 in an interview where I think my 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 dream remains to succeed at fc 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.770
 groningen and yes even though I have to go to one 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 step back 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 I always try one step up 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.189
 and then after six and six years it is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.869
 finally succeeded and especially at cambuur 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 very well developed where are you there 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.040
 got better 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.439
 well i am i am what what what 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.560
 become a professional I think 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.479
 and how to deal with it in football 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 in and also become quiet in my 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.799
 game I think entirely as a defender and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.960
 yes especially soccer playing soccer fill the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.180
 it also improves as you get older 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 is that you get more experience that you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.409
 can take a lot with it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.090
 Yeah right and yes I absolutely absolutely 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.549
 I was 19 when I left so 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 with I did not realize quite what 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.619
 professional football and I realize that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.189
 already good here now 25 in more already 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.540
 station yes that's right but yes I already have 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 I already have six to play football 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.739
 experience that you can take that with you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.830
 that saves a lot 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.160
 be a great season 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.160
