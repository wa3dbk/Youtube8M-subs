00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.819
 it is one of the us car icon 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.429
 as such 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.040
 the ford really needs to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 fiftieth birthday will be published in 2014 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.730
 a completely new model 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.830
 that's why the expectations are great 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 they get even bigger through the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.550
 fact that the sports car finally 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.490
 officially come back to europe the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 new mustang cites the original model of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.740
 1964 , however, with large grill and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 narrow seemingly from the future on 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.399
 In turn, the three lamps are allowed 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 stripes left and right are not missing 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.879
 are an essential design feature and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
 in the future three-dimensionally worked out 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.399
 which, in spite of everything, attracts attention 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.379
 then it seems much more harmonious than before 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.329
 but at the same time cheaper the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.050
 coupe comes a little less than 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 the simultaneously developed convertible 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.949
 relatively small measures take care of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 this impression the height was at three 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.439
 centimeter reduces the rear track 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 six centimeters widened unchanged 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.619
 stay length and wheelbase 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 they are 4 76 meters and 2 72, respectively 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.619
 meter was cleverly developed further 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 The cockpit there is solid 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.470
 Toggle switch in metal appearance and a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.150
 8 inch touchscreen in the center console 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.150
 also assistance systems like dead angle 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 warner tracking assistant and 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.579
 distance control are to have 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.250
 his remarkable goes under the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.290
 sharpened sheet in front of yourself benchmark in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.470
 Things dynamics were both the mustang 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.930
 Boss 302 also has the Porsche 911 and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 the bmw m3 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 that is why the previous rear flies 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.229
 Starrachse on the scrap as a substitute 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 there is an independent suspension 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.500
 integral handlebar with transverse stabilizer in 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 Europe gets needs the performance 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 packs you ms i make bigger cooler 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 then fit him for the German highway 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.259
 we come to the thickest bomb in europe 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 a four-cylinder wanders under the hood 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.730
 it is a 2.3 liter ecoboost petrol 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.470
 with direct injection variable 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.620
 valve control and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.560
 turbo concentrated technology for massive power 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.710
 namely 39 ps and 400 newton meters 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.010
 maximum torque in the usa 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.350
 Widely offered the 3.7 liter v6 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 also 3 109 ps but a little less 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.760
 torque 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 they see the hood of a pattern 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.710
 heard an eight-cylinder no problem 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.680
 videos ford also in europe and indeed 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.220
 in the gt model beech then there are five 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.959
 liter displacement 426 hp and 529 newton meters 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.240
 the associated gears always have 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.800
 six gears who switch automatically 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.310
 lets get switch paddles behind the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 steering wheel 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.740
 By the way , the new pattern is being built 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.500
 like his predecessors in the us 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.190
 Expected in early 2015, he is supposed to 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.190
 come to us
