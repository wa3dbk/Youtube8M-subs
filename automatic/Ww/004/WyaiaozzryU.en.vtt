well<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> lot<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.600> pictures<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:58.030> I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
well with a lot of pictures because I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.490 
well with a lot of pictures because I
want<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.330> test<00:01:59.280> different<00:02:00.280> ISO<00:02:00.850> settings<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
want to test different ISO settings it's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.230 
want to test different ISO settings it's
not<00:02:05.740> as<00:02:05.920> heavy<00:02:06.220> as<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.550> thought<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.940> would<00:02:07.090> be

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
not as heavy as I thought it would be

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.470 
not as heavy as I thought it would be
it's<00:02:07.750> almost<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.890> same<00:02:09.130> way<00:02:09.369> as<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.300> 90<00:02:10.770> but

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it's almost the same way as the 90 but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.200 
it's almost the same way as the 90 but
it<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.380> seems<00:02:14.620> more<00:02:14.980> solid<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.760> guess<00:02:16.000> it's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
it just it seems more solid I guess it's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.580 
it just it seems more solid I guess it's
because<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.790> aluminum<00:02:18.790> Agni<00:02:19.270> embody<00:02:19.630> it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
because of the aluminum Agni embody it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.350 
because of the aluminum Agni embody it
the<00:02:21.070> grip<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.580> definitely<00:02:22.060> more<00:02:24.270> solid<00:02:25.270> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the grip is definitely more solid it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.620 
the grip is definitely more solid it
just<00:02:25.540> feels<00:02:25.780> feels<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.910> good<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.600> your

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
