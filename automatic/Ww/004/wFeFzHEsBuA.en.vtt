00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.680
 with what shoes I play drums me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 they ask around and really not 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.800
 there is neither appropriate nor the one who should not 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.439
 use everything in this of music besides 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 it is possible you can touch without shoes 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.759
 it's even something that I did for a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 time because it occurred to me I said 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.090
 What is the appropriate man? 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.600
 I go to the fixed because I can always 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 remove the shoes then I can 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.660
 get used to playing barefoot plus I 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 loved the drummer def leppard and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.720
 I said who better in control of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.630
 pedals that someone who has to use 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.000
 both the oxygen pedal genius and 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.130
 It turns out that a great day at a concert 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 it was so cold that it really did not 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.930
 I could take off the shoes then the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.590
 answer that I found through the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.970
 time is that there is no proper shoe 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 but that as much as possible you have to 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.430
 get used to any type of shoe 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.280
 because because anything can 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.079
 happen then there is no proper can 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.020
 watch videos out there of sila and playing 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.329
 even with heels 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.460
 but that if they have the opportunity to 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.759
 have all your shoes to be 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.950
 drummer all the time good I what 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.630
 what would I do to try a shoe in the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.719
 battery is that I can work for 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.719
 me in two things once in the hype 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.850
 to be able to do my double punches either 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.030
 of those that you use where you 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.190
 hit the pedal here first let's say in 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.090
 what we call the first 25% of the pedal 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.420
 in this area and then up here as 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.380
 in 80% of the pedal to make a hit 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.149
 double 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.270
 if you are of the technique of 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.240
 slip good I would look for a shoe 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.670
 that suddenly slides well and I've seen 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.439
 people who wear up dance shoes from 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.039
 top to be able to do that kind of 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.140
 slide because they do too and there 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:11.259
 other people like me who use the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.259
 heel and tip to make a double hit 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 and for that purpose then I 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.810
 I would look for a shoe that allows me to do 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 that's just other drummers and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.340
 from time to time I need to do this 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.620
 We are inviting Colombian music 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.420
 folkloric with what the maracas does 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.720
 with the high hat and do this kind of 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 figure 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.840
 and at one point a guy playing with 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.240
 a boot cowboy boot and it worked 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.450
 very good because he had a perfect heel 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.970
 to hit that pedal hit there 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.330
 then really if the response from 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.910
 appropriate shoe to touch is the one that 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.800
 each one of you fits but 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.320
 I hope that what I just told you 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.830
 be a little guide of how it is 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.830
 catch it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.430
 make it like obviously
