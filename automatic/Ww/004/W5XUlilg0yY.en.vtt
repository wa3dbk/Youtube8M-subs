00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.950 
up front and I'm using this device to
steer<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.150> don't<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.750> move<00:01:43.900> the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
steer so I don't have to move the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.630 
steer so I don't have to move the
steering<00:01:44.410> wheel<00:01:44.560> it's<00:01:44.770> calm<00:01:45.070> enough<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.550> I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
could get by doing that and so that's

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.260 
could get by doing that and so that's
