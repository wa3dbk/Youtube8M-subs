00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.460
 well this time is I bring some 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.770
 very very interesting topics more than is a 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.060
 package of topics that is very father to 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.730
 their what they are called 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.680
 chronos and good are different topics like 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.199
 we can see first of all when 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.279
 we install we will enter into account for 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.250
 if they do not have winter it is not reinstalled 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.800
 automatically and it offers us what they are 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.150
 seven different topics for the local 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.350
 something that I want to show you is that 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.260
 many ask that I'm going to show you 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.420
 first as you can see in this part of 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.719
 here I do not know what the date is 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.890
 day now also the time and others and 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.510
 he always asks me half how I do it 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.000
 to be able to remove this blog from here 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.350
 above and a way that I do it to not 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.840
 be loading so many tweets in my 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.210
 system is with spring you take two since 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.769
 well this makes all the easy 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 managing my device without orange e 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.920
 cable reported by the video so that 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.170
 you can see it, they only go in what 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 which is lock screen and hide the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.670
 top bar come out and then make a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.020
 respite we came back and well we did it already 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.070
 we return as you can see and I take off 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.600
 what is the top bar masters 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.360
 focus on what the logs are good 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 the themes of what the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.650
 system generates is very father like 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.230
 good is the first something that I liked 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.820
 much the ease of these issues being 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.120
 can rotate I'm going to move a little 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.130
 phone and they will notice that good here 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.600
 they can rotate perfectly and well 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.550
 this applies to all the issues that we 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.380
 includes this package we are going to check the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 others as I said they are 7 for that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.760
 it will be shown winterboard disable 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.190
 they do not come in English and French in that 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.590
 case I will give and enable 1 and 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.479
 Now I'm going to put the 2 and let's go 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.160
 makes a start and we organize again 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.120
 and good as you can see these premieres 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.040
 two friends 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.530
 he was very father and well I know they are 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.750
 watching now on screen is the kronos 3 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.390
 As you can see let's put the kronos 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.510
 watching on screen my favorite ssd the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.760
 I know the ones I like the most 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.870
 business that is sold now is the chrono 5 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960
 as you can see has as well as 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.520
 constellations of the zodiacal signs 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.320
 so we can chrono 6 and 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.900
 good screen test gentlemen is the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.970
 throne 6 and we will see the last already the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.080
 last one that is the chrono 7 and 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.680
 Now I like it to be this way 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.300
 moment is the clock 70 this very parents 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.410
 all the topics I liked a lot and I 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.120
 It is very interesting that they leave me in the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.070
 comments what is your favorite of these 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540
 seven themes good to install it friends 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.100
 you just have to enter as always 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.630
 well and wait for it to finish loading 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.130
 use that will end up loading if 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.360
 they only go to injury to look like 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 you can see the bottom right 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.630
 I'm going to look for ls zinc packets such 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.690
 and how it appears on the top 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.910
 them 619 for iphone 5 for iphone 4 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.220
 3gs good basically for all and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.480
 compatible with ios 6 as you can see 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.760
 here in the description of what is the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 tweet he is another alternative option that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.690
 is to use cloud gate that is completely 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.130
 free a tweet only to hide 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.930
 what will raise superior with the truth 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.040
 with sprint or month since that apart 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.689
 is to see the possibility of doing other 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.219
 modifications a phone and so we 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.930
 still on your device full and so 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.579
 loaded with tweets one has a cost a 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.109
 dollar with 91 cents in the repu tribus 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.519
 He decided to remember her how she serves please 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.840
 check in the description of the video in the 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.280
 part of up down is very important 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.599
 that they do it since good always I play 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.579
 a repository we can 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.109
 get completely free and so 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.310
 the developer ensures a correct 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.659
 working it's worth it what 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.950
