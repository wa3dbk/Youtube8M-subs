 that is to say 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.619
 that the solution is composed of her 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609
 There is more lf channel bread 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 who takes care of everything that is

 outside of the team of two lines that 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.089
 it's smaller than we have 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.590
 and the possibility of having in each of those two general lines as 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.020
 four civilians that is to say we can have is that several companies that emit 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.080

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.900
 to ask on foot 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.740
 Next is the product 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.600
 saw 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.880
 for 4-5 dodge 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.170
 this one of him step for the market 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 efe determiners

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120
 clients that are generators and legs 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.360
 there was half an hour a day 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.660
 left a few whole households where there is a huge amount of people 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.159
 this that 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.430
 is companies can save in the so-called area 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 so that this team does the same as their team 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.789
 integrated titino that plays so well and that chanel 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.559
 internally to this team we do the programming 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.259
 I love the prefixes according to the companies that fear operating the crime 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.899
 market is to say that the ps3 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.539
 we can see here that by the way that the real 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.759
 humala lamented that directly connects village to the internet 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.189
 and it is also the third quarter proved conducive to everything the subject 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.609
 Of configuration 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.619
 of the machine 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.189
 for that comparison 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.269
 paez does each one of the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.489
 in modules 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.239
 bengoa and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.569
 ilse 15ta el sinn 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 have for four sets 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.459
 the saint has the product line already 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.579
 intermediate 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.779
 we have 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.079
 the team 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.379
 the vochol finaldi netbook 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.559
 incorporates 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.459
 and functionality in San Esteban sheepfolds 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.689
 vii 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.359
 Internet telephony 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.359
 but this team that has 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.519
 four modules 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.619
 d for four centuries 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.520
 that is 4 4 and 6 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.299
 this team 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.769
 allow 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.819
 16 concurrent flames 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.399
 the interesting thing this haiti machine has the posility 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.669
 incorporated 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.359
 without being 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.069
 who wants to be honest 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.269
 is to make it look like it's a repository we made it's a love and inadmissible 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.839
 who has the equipment 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.569
 peton cicpc and tiki benefits 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.239
 our client who has 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.579
 this machine 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.879
 so for example if it were a minute this way 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.159
 Remove the attorney who has to move 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.599
 For example, it is possible that the company that takes into account the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.269
 minutes that you want for that company at a very convenient price 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.589
 can be automatically the next German ship 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.829
 and that is in the minute 2 thousand pure 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.639
 to assault anyone 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.789
 bush if I felt that I stayed 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.900
 apart from these poor 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.340
 the alleged ETA 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.529
 so 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.810
 this greatly facilitates the administration 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.009
 for companies Kyrgyzstan trying to tie short to follow the leader 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.029
 communications 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:38.969
 by his side the flame is insured 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.480
 has two cards 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.099
 thirty thirty civilians 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.900
 once and here is the other 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 and under that is the other card to give for yours 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:50.319
 i 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.210
 that as I said earlier this month and a half 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.469
 excellent violent incident 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.120
 because the customers 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.080
 certainly apart from having 16 other concurrent 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.289
 who consider it 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.120
 always facilitate the processing of files and penalties 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.100
 the ivory coast consul was made in the attack after this descent 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.870
 below this team 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.159
 Amnesty has the same functionality 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.159
 here are protected from the Canary Islands 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.309
 that is to say that this is a large warehouse of signs 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.879
 creating versions 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.599
 what continental 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.599
 192 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.039
 later 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.349
 i the car when it puts xenserver concept this this module what because 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.240
 I carried 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 up to 512 6 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.740
 this is a module also to functionalities p this module uu that 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.050
 taca 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.360
 the well-being of disabled people so they repeat themselves 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.889
 madrid 22 Dec 6 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.029
 If a client wants to have more 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.169
 the concurrent and have 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.539
 ee another that is called concurrent the client will claim with his package 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.689
 unique telecom to snow on both of these computers 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:19.839
 It is disturbing 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.619
 8 15 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.300
 other components for eta 8
