that much said I guess let's start and
what<00:01:38.690> this<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.289> it's<00:01:39.680> really<00:01:39.830> just<00:01:40.039> a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
what this is is it's really just a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
you can scratch you can cut and probably

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.399 
you can scratch you can cut and probably
the<00:02:26.250> most<00:02:26.430> handy<00:02:26.849> feature<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.239> has<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
the most handy feature it has is the

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.570 
the most handy feature it has is the
ability<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.980> sync<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:29.610> tracks<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.450> are<00:02:31.049> a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
ability to sync two tracks that are a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.680 
ability to sync two tracks that are a
different<00:02:32.580> speed<00:02:33.019> together<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.569> not

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
different speed together so it's not

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.059 
different speed together so it's not
together<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.110> now<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.769> service

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
together right now but at the service

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.080 
together right now but at the service
song<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.310> could<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.579> them<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:44.819> at<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
song you could get them going at the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.430 
song you could get them going at the
same<00:02:45.239> tempo<00:02:45.659> so<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.900> don't<00:02:46.049> have<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> worry

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
same tempo so they don't have to worry

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
this is the main pitch bender and then

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.619 
this is the main pitch bender and then
there's<00:03:08.040> also<00:03:08.190> temporary<00:03:09.030> pitch<00:03:09.239> Bend<00:03:09.510> up

there's also temporary pitch Bend up

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.149 
there's also temporary pitch Bend up
here<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.049> goes<00:03:10.200> back<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.440> normal<00:03:10.859> tempo

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159

that on each track and then on each side
you<00:03:48.330> could<00:03:48.600> also<00:03:48.980> either

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
you could also either

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.199 
you could also either
uqs<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.630> go<00:03:51.750> back<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.350> spot<00:03:53.250> whenever<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
uqs to go back to that spot whenever you

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.390 
uqs to go back to that spot whenever you
want<00:03:54.420> later<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> song<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.100> just<00:03:56.280> go

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
want later in the song you can just go

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.480 
want later in the song you can just go
back<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.560> then<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.800> can<00:03:58.920> delete<00:03:59.040> music

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
back to it and then you can delete music

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.460 
back to it and then you can delete music
you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.760> have<00:03:59.880> up<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.060> three<00:04:00.180> cues<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.320> that

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you can have up to three cues so that

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.290 
you can have up to three cues so that
could<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.650> pretty<00:04:01.890> helpful<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:03.209> you

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
could be pretty helpful and then you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.220 
could be pretty helpful and then you
also<00:04:03.450> loops<00:04:04.320> where<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.190> go<00:04:06.230> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
also loops where you can just go and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.050 
also loops where you can just go and
have<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.530> repeat<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.010> same<00:04:08.220> section<00:04:08.670> over<00:04:08.940> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
have it repeat the same section over and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.860 
have it repeat the same section over and
over<00:04:09.209> again<00:04:09.330> until<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.830> really<00:04:11.600> with<00:04:12.600> loops

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
over again until you really with loops

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.229 
over again until you really with loops
is<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.130> only<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.340> one<00:04:14.430> loop<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.090> a

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
is that you can only have one loop at a

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.150 
is that you can only have one loop at a
time<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.140> them<00:04:16.260> live<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.100> you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
time and you have to do them live so you

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.300 
time and you have to do them live so you
can't<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:17.459> certain<00:04:18.169> sections<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:20.100> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
can't have certain sections that you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.830 
can't have certain sections that you
want<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.640> loop<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.180> tell<00:04:21.750> them

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
want to loop that you just tell them

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.170 
want to loop that you just tell them
when<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:22.380> which<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.980> thought<00:04:23.970> would<00:04:24.090> be

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
when to do that which I thought would be

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.490 
when to do that which I thought would be
pretty<00:04:24.390> handy<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:24.990> doesn't<00:04:25.200> have<00:04:25.290> that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
pretty handy but it doesn't have that

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.790 
pretty handy but it doesn't have that
and<00:04:26.400> then<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.850> have<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.100> say<00:04:30.800> whatever

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
and then you have you can say whatever

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.170 
and then you have you can say whatever
song<00:04:32.100> you're<00:04:32.280> on<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.610> could<00:04:32.760> load<00:04:32.970> that

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
song you're on and you could load that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.150 
song you're on and you could load that
song<00:04:33.450> just<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:33.930> here<00:04:34.260> onto<00:04:34.500> each<00:04:34.710> deck<00:04:35.010> if

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
song just right here onto each deck if

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.010 
song just right here onto each deck if
you<00:04:35.250> don't<00:04:35.370> want<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.550> queue<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.790> up<00:04:36.020> makes

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
you don't want to queue it up makes

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.330 
you don't want to queue it up makes
things<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.290> bit<00:04:37.320> easier<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.860> pretty<00:04:41.250> much

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
things a bit easier and it's pretty much

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.510 
things a bit easier and it's pretty much
all<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.000> say<00:04:42.530> again<00:04:43.530> if<00:04:44.280> you're<00:04:44.490> a

easy I haven't had much trouble with it
I've<00:04:50.970> had<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.180> for<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.510> couple<00:04:51.870> months<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.970> the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
I've had it for a couple months and the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.630 
I've had it for a couple months and the
deck<00:04:54.150> itself<00:04:54.620> hasn't<00:04:55.620> had<00:04:55.740> any<00:04:55.890> problems<00:04:56.430> but

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
deck itself hasn't had any problems but

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.820 
deck itself hasn't had any problems but
Virtual<00:04:57.030> DJ<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.630> pretty<00:04:57.960> glitchy<00:04:58.260> sock<00:04:58.590> for

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
Virtual DJ is a pretty glitchy sock for

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.900 
Virtual DJ is a pretty glitchy sock for
a<00:04:58.890> lot<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.280> time<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.520> guess<00:05:02.669> that's<00:05:02.790> all

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910
