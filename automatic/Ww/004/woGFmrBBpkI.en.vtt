00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.830 

I<00:00:08.770> loaded<00:00:09.770> up<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:09.980> Altos<00:00:10.520> and<00:00:10.820> I'm<00:00:11.600> going<00:00:11.780> to

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
I loaded up the Altos and I'm going to

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.720 
I loaded up the Altos and I'm going to
type<00:00:12.050> in<00:00:12.260> in<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.490> depths<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:13.970> Mordor<00:00:15.220> in<00:00:16.220> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.909 

dad<00:00:21.130> capital<00:00:22.130> PICUs<00:00:22.610> all<00:00:23.619> non<00:00:24.619> pitch

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
dad capital PICUs all non pitch

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.580 
dad capital PICUs all non pitch
constants<00:00:25.580> are<00:00:25.730> always<00:00:25.759> capitalized<00:00:26.720> pitch

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
constants are always capitalized pitch

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.960 
constants are always capitalized pitch
consonants<00:00:28.220> are<00:00:28.279> always<00:00:28.610> lowercase<00:00:30.340> in<00:00:31.340> the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
consonants are always lowercase in the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.030 
consonants are always lowercase in the
depth<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:33.320> th<00:00:34.210> but<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.360> sound<00:00:36.170> is<00:00:36.500> actually

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
depth so th but the sound is actually

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.600 
depth so th but the sound is actually
non<00:00:37.280> pitch<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:37.910> it's<00:00:38.110> capital<00:00:39.610> exclamation

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
non pitch so it's capital exclamation

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:49.660 
non pitch so it's capital exclamation
tap<00:00:40.910> depths<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.050> depths<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:45.430> more<00:00:48.100> door<00:00:49.100> in

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
tap depths in the depths of more door in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:15.310 
tap depths in the depths of more door in
the<00:00:50.240> depths<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.900> Mordor<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.860> Altos

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.020 

okay<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.560> couple<00:01:16.860> things<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.250> noticed<00:01:17.640> was

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
okay so a couple things I noticed was

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
okay so a couple things I noticed was
that<00:01:18.080> some<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.440> non<00:01:19.830> pitch<00:01:20.070> consonants

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that some of the non pitch consonants

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
that some of the non pitch consonants
like<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.120> word<00:01:21.270> depths<00:01:21.840> were<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.350> soft

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like in the word depths were a bit soft

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.790 
like in the word depths were a bit soft
so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.660> like<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> showed<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.410> earlier

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
so I can go in like I showed you earlier

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.940 
so I can go in like I showed you earlier
and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.250> ii<00:01:26.820> click<00:01:27.480> on<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:28.350> letter<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and I can ii click on that letter and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
and I can ii click on that letter and
actually<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.760> just<00:01:30.360> change<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.690> velocity

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
actually go and just change the velocity

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500 
actually go and just change the velocity
but<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> noticed<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.670> general<00:01:33.150> trend

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
but I kind of noticed a general trend

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.500 
but I kind of noticed a general trend
that<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:33.930> thought<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.370> non<00:01:36.240> pitch

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
that I thought that the the non pitch

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.950 
that I thought that the the non pitch
constants<00:01:37.050> were<00:01:37.230> just<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.650> soft<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.960> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
constants were just a bit soft and this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.180 
constants were just a bit soft and this
is<00:01:40.140> something<00:01:40.440> you'll<00:01:40.650> you'll<00:01:40.920> encounter

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
is something you'll you'll encounter

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.560 
is something you'll you'll encounter
depending<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.790> whether<00:01:41.940> you're<00:01:42.060> playing<00:01:42.210> solo

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
depending on whether you're playing solo

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020 
depending on whether you're playing solo
lines<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.260> chords<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.920> fast<00:01:44.190> or<00:01:44.430> slow<00:01:44.760> at<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
lines or chords or fast or slow at a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.260 
lines or chords or fast or slow at a
time<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:46.470> we've<00:01:46.590> done<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> really

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
time so what we've done is put a really

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
time so what we've done is put a really
cool<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.810> slider<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> voice<00:01:50.970> property

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
cool little slider in the voice property

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.870 
cool little slider in the voice property
menu<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.140> bottom<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.860> non<00:01:53.040> pitch<00:01:53.280> constants

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
menu the bottom the non pitch constants

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
menu the bottom the non pitch constants
volume<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.650> just<00:01:55.830> increase<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.460> bit

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
volume and I can just increase it a bit

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.050 
volume and I can just increase it a bit
generally<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:59.030> increases<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
generally and that just increases the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
generally and that just increases the
volume<00:02:00.320> overall<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.040> pitch

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
volume overall for the not pitch

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
volume overall for the not pitch
constants<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.720> check<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.080> out

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
constants and let's just check that out

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.850 
constants and let's just check that out
and<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.560> how<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:13.350> pretty<00:02:13.590> good

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and see how that does it's pretty good

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:25.160 
and see how that does it's pretty good
maybe<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.340> little<00:02:14.489> bit<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:23.420> was<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> bit<00:02:24.630> much

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
maybe a little bit more I was a bit much

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.500 
maybe a little bit more I was a bit much
but<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.100> how<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.030> easily<00:02:27.360> get

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
but you can see how you can easily get

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.940 
but you can see how you can easily get
going<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:27.959> control<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.830> for

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
going there and control that so it's for

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
going there and control that so it's for
the<00:02:29.010> back<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.450> really<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:31.260> I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the back here and I think really what I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
the back here and I think really what I
really<00:02:31.560> wanted<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.860> hear<00:02:32.160> was<00:02:32.400> maybe<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.570> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
really wanted to hear was maybe just a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.320 
really wanted to hear was maybe just a
little<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.110> drawn<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.820> th

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
little bit more drawn out of the the th

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.140 
little bit more drawn out of the the th
and<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> ass<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.500> could<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.970> change<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and the ass so I could just change the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210 
and the ass so I could just change the
length<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.590> left<00:02:43.590> them<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:44.070> bit

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
length a bit left them a little bit

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
length a bit left them a little bit
maybe<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.300> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.570> more<00:02:45.720> D<00:02:46.080> as<00:02:46.380> well

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
maybe a little bit more D as well

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.000 
maybe a little bit more D as well
gonna<00:02:47.280> give<00:02:47.400> depths<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
gonna give depths and then I'm of I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.320 
gonna give depths and then I'm of I
thought<00:02:50.220> maybe<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.580> didn't<00:02:50.760> hear<00:02:50.850> quite<00:02:51.120> enough

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
thought maybe I didn't hear quite enough

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.630 
thought maybe I didn't hear quite enough
V<00:02:51.630> let's<00:02:52.019> lengthen<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:52.860> bit<00:02:53.010> here

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
V let's lengthen that a little bit here

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:13.930 
V let's lengthen that a little bit here
that<00:02:53.700> sounds<00:02:54.000> like

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.000 

I've<00:03:14.940> typed<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.260> bomb<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.830> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
I've typed in this is the bomb and I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.700 
I've typed in this is the bomb and I
loaded<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.550> bases<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> good

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
loaded up the bases and this is a good

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.150 
loaded up the bases and this is a good
example<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.910> phrase<00:03:21.690> which<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.620> might<00:03:22.980> want

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
example of a phrase which I might want

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:34.160 
example of a phrase which I might want
to<00:03:23.190> play<00:03:24.020> like<00:03:25.020> this<00:03:29.660> or<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:31.140> may<00:03:31.680> want<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:33.170> use

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
to play like this or I may want to use

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.560 
to play like this or I may want to use
the<00:03:34.440> louder<00:03:34.920> velocities<00:03:35.640> hit<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.360> keys

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the louder velocities hit the keys

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.080 
the louder velocities hit the keys
harder<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.230> any<00:03:37.470> velocity<00:03:37.800> over<00:03:38.280> 102<00:03:38.880> will

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
harder and any velocity over 102 will

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:52.670 
harder and any velocity over 102 will
introduce<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.870> staccato<00:03:40.230> accent<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:51.680> you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
introduce a staccato accent so if you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.280 
introduce a staccato accent so if you
use<00:03:52.860> any<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.550> choirs<00:03:53.900> with<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.960> exception

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
use any of the choirs with the exception

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.820 
use any of the choirs with the exception
of<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> boys<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.780> are<00:03:58.230> looking<00:03:58.380> for<00:03:58.590> a

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
of the boys and you are looking for a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.030 
of the boys and you are looking for a
faster<00:03:59.760> more<00:04:00.180> accented<00:04:00.930> stronger<00:04:01.680> attack

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
faster more accented stronger attack

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.730 
faster more accented stronger attack
it's<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.850> simple<00:04:03.000> as<00:04:03.270> just<00:04:03.300> using<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.530> louder

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
it's as simple as just using the louder

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.040 
it's as simple as just using the louder
velocities<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.550> get<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:06.810> built

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
velocities to get that and that's built

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.830 
velocities to get that and that's built
