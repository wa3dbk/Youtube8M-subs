00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.880 
becomes time to harvest they're out here
all<00:05:06.420> day<00:05:06.450> picking<00:05:06.930> their<00:05:07.230> corn<00:05:07.500> or<00:05:07.710> whatnot

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
all day picking their corn or whatnot

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.780 
all day picking their corn or whatnot
but<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:09.900> don't<00:05:10.110> have<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.470> much<00:05:10.680> corn<00:05:10.980> planted

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
but I don't have that much corn planted

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.050 
but I don't have that much corn planted
so<00:05:12.920> hopefully<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:14.190> won't<00:05:14.340> kill<00:05:14.640> me<00:05:14.790> when<00:05:14.940> it

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
so hopefully it won't kill me when it

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.670 
so hopefully it won't kill me when it
when<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.420> come<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:16.670> harvest
