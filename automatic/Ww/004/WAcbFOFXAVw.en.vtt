00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:14.929
 the analysis of the game is 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:19.490
 I would like to congratulate my team for 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.349
 she has played in this match, and instead of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.080
 the dedication that demonstrated 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.859
 except bad luck downside assists 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.259
 moments something else needs to be called 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.360
 reasons for today's defeat of their 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.460
 Does she have a toyota yaris 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.110
 if we are very scrupulous 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.449
 look then of course some mistakes we 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.570
 have allowed 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.930
 which cost us results in 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.550
 this game but if you evaluate this match in 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.879
 generally 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.030
 on the level of dedication on the level of struggle for 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.129
 rhythm that we showed by then 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 the skill level that we showed 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.230
 it was a great match to wet very 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 high level because we created 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.120
 really large number of scoring 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 moments and moments 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.660
 obvious several times our footballers 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.770
 turns one on one with the goalkeeper 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.970
 rival 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 which could not get it to score 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.700
 to make 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 luchano that if it's not a secret you said 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 after the game the player is anji and in my opinion it is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 was shirkov 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.040
 zhirkov not 7 glad to see how much I 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 I remember I congratulated on a victory as well as all 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.880
 Anzhi players whom I met on my own 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.649
 paths leaving the field because 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.320
 will need to congratulate the game today 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.780
 did zenith play led zenith but anji 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 achieved victory it is certainly important 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.579
 for them the result is your players in that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.229
 Halk very often sony appealed 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.539
 to Sergei beautiful you share them 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.659
 resentment with external judging or not 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.770
 nor 720 here he left he damn 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.630
 I dampened ira washing you not to me 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.640
 it seems at certain moments of the game the whole 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:04.509
 the stadium was a little puzzled by 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.619
 decisions that made sergey sergey 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.810
 one thing I can say for sure that there is no 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.260
 Sergey's responsibility for the result 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.799
 who got today's game because 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.810
 responsible for the result lies with us 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.760
 Sergey is not responsible for this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.140
 result because he is like a student 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.599
 returns home doing homework 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.579
 task to do the task that he 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.500
 give the teacher as I speak to you 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.200
 football players play on the right flank and he 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.519
 plays on the right flank and Sergey today 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 there was homework 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.810
 come st petersburg and hold the ball 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.480
 madoka hold this match like that 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.840
 position because we see these times gave 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.170
 task to hold such a game in relation to 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.049
 Zenith in my opinion happened today 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.060
 another more serious thing because 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.310
 after the meeting, I specifically 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.340
 asked to know were present 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.739
 striking 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.930
 I was told that his something in my opinion 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.810
 it is very on 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.120
 of course serious and when the coach doesn't 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.450
 come to watch the game and his team 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.550
 today his team performed very 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 strong make up today you are your 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.459
 served 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.010
 probably the 5 best judges and all corps and 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.860
 I think that if the coach does not come 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.129
 look at your students in such 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.420
 responsible game is a bad signal and i 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.459
 I hope he has respect 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.670
 reasons for his deed valentine to that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.319
 so that I stay home today and not 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 come see only win my 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.750
 the team and if I did the president 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.829
 club Alexander Dyukov 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.959
 rightly you had to fire me 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.670
 got the impression that missed 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.650
 goal needed realized football players 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 Zenith, they began to worry more often 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.519
 to err or this is an erroneous opinion 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.220
 which I am is a voice number good afternoon 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.930
 This is think that our football players just 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.150
 did not get nervous after missed 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.280
 the goal is already somewhere in the 5th minute of the game when 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.859
 understood that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.810
 episode is treated a little strange 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:13.170
 mode is not always adequate 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.680
 and not always adequate for both 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.769
 parties and of course it's hard to play such 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.540
 the setting is calm and 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.440
 so when you feel that in any 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.870
 The moment you can show the card but I 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.340
 I agree with you that you definitely need 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.770
 be very careful replace try 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.240
 to be as concentrated as possible 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.850
 each of the moments of the game and by no means 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.700
 case not to allow 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:43.889
 don't give will emotions because we 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.510
 must be confident and know what 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.940
 we can do everything ourselves that everything depends 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.620
 from us because we certainly could 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.460
 make the result of this meeting 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.680
 was in our favor despite the fact that 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.229
 the field was someone who was performing on the tower 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.740
 also not much you politician before last 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:05.340
 season to the zenith of Makhachkala won with 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.010
 considering 10 I asked you for that 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.160
 the moment that the truth is that anji was playing 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.890
 heart zenith head today I tell you 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.020
 I ask the same question just the opposite 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.820
 more units today heart he played he 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.680
 so that such rational heads are 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.910
 agree to become 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.160
 angeja spirit of this brand set this is this 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.610
 this is a big team strong team not 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.830
 it was great today that they 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.830
 managed to keep calm along 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.330
 the course of the match is definitely their merit 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.360
 cuff teams on the show even 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.919
 despite the fact that as you say he also played 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.039
 head played rationally nonetheless 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.379
 they are ahead in attacking actions and 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.370
 managed to create some beautiful 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.289
 moments passed successful combinations on 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.949
 it was also nice to watch but 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.740
 summing up, I will say it again 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.879
 the whole game because I was laid out 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.480
 convinced that zenith 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:07.640
 Of course I deserve more allocated 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.510
 I would like to add to my end 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.850
 really very nice that 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.760
 heading and roberto carlos have achieved this 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.950
 success because these are two very big 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.900
 man were two big soccer figures 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:27.230
 heading big man coach 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.020
 incredible harmony is very strong 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.930
 personality and roberto carlos real 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.060
 champion real winner they took 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.290
 for this team 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.690
 difficult situation and managed to bring it to 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.270
 very serious level therefore not 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.470
 definitely deserve the words of praise and 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:52.900
 I am pleased that they managed to achieve 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.900
 this serious result
