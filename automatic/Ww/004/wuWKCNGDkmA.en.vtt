to them in any reasonable amount of time

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.319 
to them in any reasonable amount of time
it's<00:00:31.520> just<00:00:31.579> easier<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.000> go<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.239> our

journey home so what's unique tourmaster
has<00:00:44.890> kind<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:45.980> changed<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:48.350> game<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.650> little

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
has kind of changed the game a little

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.990 
has kind of changed the game a little
bit<00:00:49.900> they're<00:00:50.900> using<00:00:51.230> carbon<00:00:51.590> fiber<00:00:52.160> heating

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
bit they're using carbon fiber heating

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.020 
bit they're using carbon fiber heating
elements<00:00:53.540> which<00:00:54.350> are<00:00:54.590> much<00:00:54.980> narrower<00:00:55.310> Stern's

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
elements which are much narrower Stern's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.450 
elements which are much narrower Stern's
they<00:00:56.690> take<00:00:56.900> less<00:00:57.170> energy<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:57.829> they<00:00:58.250> heat<00:00:58.430> up

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
they take less energy and they heat up

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.190 
they take less energy and they heat up
very<00:00:58.610> quickly<00:00:59.240> so<00:00:59.570> what<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.720> gives<00:01:00.020> you

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
very quickly so what that gives you

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
particularly in an electric glove is a

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.940 
particularly in an electric glove is a

much heat in the glove doesn't work has
to<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.010> very<00:03:37.250> mild<00:03:37.670> low<00:03:38.060> setting<00:03:38.540> this

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
to be a very mild low setting this

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.839 
to be a very mild low setting this
however<00:03:39.590> has<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> high<00:03:40.129> setting<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.730> can

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
however has a high setting so it can

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.309 
however has a high setting so it can
kind<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.150> warm<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.629> and<00:03:41.840> then<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.019> can<00:03:42.170> set
