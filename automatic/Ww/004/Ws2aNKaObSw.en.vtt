00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.420
 so now we start training 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.630
 chest muscles 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.880
 let's not stand a little bit yet 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.950
 wanted but a little bit still there will be muscle 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.439
 breasts can be divided into three as 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.320
 would be the department is with us and the upper chest 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.880
 middle and bottom separated Well else 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.570
 we can add an internal department here 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.210
 fleet 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.910
 here is this zone yes that is the internal department 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.010
 some would apparently this is the outline of the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.690
 have any exercises we have for we 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.210
 load mid to mid base 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.530
 chest section is a standard barbell bench press 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.129
 lying on a horizontal bench it is with us 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.559
 i'm a mirror in the chest muscles 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.989
 barbells or dumbbells lying under a degree 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.179
 a yacht at thirty forty five degrees on 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.859
 sloping bench beer head and for 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.859
 lower chest this is with us 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.470
 bench press and either dumbbell under the degree 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.570
 grow upside down tilt 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.780
 horizontal view of the middle department 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.900
 be rude with tilt up head like u 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.240
 us until the upper division will not like with 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.700
 tilt down the head to exercise 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 lower thoracic regions so drove 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.530
 let's start exactly the romanian central 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:38.040
 barbell bench press based position when 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.420
 we just sit on the bench and fit 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.850
 highlights such to eyes here 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.800
 were exactly under the heading of opachki 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.619
 always we are pressed to the bench that is, we 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.200
 never even when we push the bar 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.430
 we plant shovels because we will 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.590
 injure your shoulders how would it 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
 wrong no more take here no 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.509
 we train whether we lay down 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.240
 troops wko shovels reduce the virus 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.850
 is in that position ie 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.830
 always like this and when we 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.259
 we never squeeze the blades 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.550
 so that this movement was not always 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.550
 it will be like that shovels are reduced 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.160
 so let's go eyes always under the fingerboard not 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.760
 here is not here on exactly under the neck 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.530
 to completely we put on the floor and we them 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
 We do not tear off, that is, we have such points 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.120
 supports this is not a foot this is a tass which 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 always pull over me and 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.230
 this is the shoulder blade which is flattened pressed to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.390
 bench 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.849
 what grip pick barbell press 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.510
 Grab pick such to again 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:46.170
 in the lower phase the lower point is our angle 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.540
 was between the elbow angle between the shoulder and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.879
 forearm 90 degrees that is here 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.000
 such a corner wo n't go too big 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.459
 too narrow too incomprehensible from 90 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 degrees is approximately our angle that is 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.620
 pick it up for yourself it for me 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.840
 somewhere on the risks there will be ring fingers 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 somewhere 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 how we how we press the barbell itself 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 directly we undertake see here 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.120
 such division special risks 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.110
 picked up grab eyes under the fingerboard of the foot 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.500
 completely worth 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.950
 you are pressed shovels are reduced we take the bar 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.380
 remove and lower it to the middle of the chest 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.340
 we lower on the inhale not on the exhale squeeze 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.420
 on the inhale lower on the exhale we 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.420
 start click 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.610
 I also tear off my head but sometimes 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.570
 uncomfortable wants to see maybe I will 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.570
 everything 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 errors of the scapula and not taking the pelvis off 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.849
 tear off during the press and foot also 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.909
 machines cost me stop it so not poison and 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.909
 pure same 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.200
 all here with their position moments with 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.540
 bugs dismantled and 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.690
 You can add places we are now, as it were their 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.590
 try to do everything yourself jim also 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.320
 sit on the bench we go to bed we 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.090
 we press the floor tass bench blades 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.190
 reducing 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.680
 gri eyes under the neck take grip to 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.000
 we had a 90 degree elbow angle 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.780
 remove the bar to display the level 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.680
 mid chest and drop in on in exhale 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.680
 squeeze science blue 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.090
 god breath out breath out 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.010
 Now we will analyze you 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.840
 grab I talked about it again 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.440
 I repeat that there are two kinds of hats 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.360
 this is our grip closed when large 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.130
 finger covers everyone else and open 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 so -called medvezhek fleece yes we 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.190
 thumb without covering everyone else 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.730
 fingers what is the difference advantage 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.320
 pros and cons of the old take closed grip 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.330
 we include forearm in the work 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.370
 my forearm is now part of me 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.010
 load eats up forearm 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.800
 you know, yes, sheâ€™s part of leaving infants 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.270
 forearms but the plus is that we are not 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.190
 drop the barbell on the chest 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.440
 if there is a heavy weight 1 not to 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.620
 we can handle it if we take the grip 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:34.460
 open bear then we are completely 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.840
 load is directed to the chest so 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.430
 way with the forearm load goes away 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.130
 fasting we are working chest 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.360
 but there is a risk that the bar will take and 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.360
 It falls on you chest 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.950
 you alternate choose yourself with easy then 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.170
 You can open the grip of the process children already 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.950
 a lot of it is natural for safety net 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.240
 grip closed 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.240
 everyone drove on
