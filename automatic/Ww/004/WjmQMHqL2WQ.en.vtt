00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.750
 hi i'm duke as you know it came out the 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.360
 peace 1.7.2 of minecraft I wanted to do a 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.550
 videos to summarize when they are new 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.859
 that I liked more and I have to say 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.189
 also in examining all the news I 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.759
 I realized how this patch does not 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.980
 was exactly the richest the 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.439
 richer, the news is also positive 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.920
 and I am not complaining about news or though 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.450
 they are not so many and I don't know that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.430
 maybe it's a little strange to me are 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.550
 noticed only by looking at the summary now 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.410
 the various snap shots may not have been 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.330
 the most beautiful in the world, however, had a 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.100
 sense however looking at the news 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.130
 total peace I have not been 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.290
 as enthusiastic as you know they were 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.430
 added many new bayonne and those 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.400
 I must say that I especially like them 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.730
 the bayonne mei samp however they are also 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.410
 something that does not excite me about a new one 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.330
 bayon doesn't excite me until it comes 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.970
 added something unique in that 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.170
 particular bayonne for example the marsh 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.700
 it's nothing special 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.890
 however it is nice that there are 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.320
 witches' houses too 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.630
 the jungle is beautiful especially because there 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.970
 you can find the buildings of the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.400
 jungle those temples with the treasure le 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.560
 traps everything as add a bay 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 but even if aesthetically beautiful without 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.020
 that has nothing new 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.990
 I don't like it so much though now 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 I want to show these colored glasses 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.070
 these also on purely novelties 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.930
 aesthetics, however, add a tool 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.479
 in addition to all those people who 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.880
 they play minecraft mostly in 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 creative mode to create what e 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.570
 may seem few but actually they are 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 so many there are so many people doing 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.560
 pixel art 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.659
 so many people who do construction not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.250
 the ever creative survival and glasses 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.930
 colored really canoe an extra weapon yes 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.659
 can create aesthetic effects 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.350
 completely new and all in all 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.680
 so I like it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.530
 then the thing I like most is the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.429
 amplified world is a way of generating the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 world that creates these hills 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.300
 awesome look how tall he is and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.819
 the scenes are now completely 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.980
 completely new yes ever more 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.280
 shows that were not possible before 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.319
 and this is also a way of generation 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 of the world that changes profoundly to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.209
 gameplay for two reasons the first yes and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.420
 we have to go somewhere and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.650
 we find one of these mountains 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.910
 we could for example have to do a 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.560
 gallery a gallery 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.420
 think year we have a series of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.980
 building a railroad path 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 and we want to get further and there 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 we face one of these 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 huge mountains and we decide to do one 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.230
 gallery below we do the gallery not 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.549
 because we want to do a gallery but 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.590
 just to go through the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.290
 mountain as it really happens 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.420
 and this also lost me a lot up to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.459
 Before this kind of world 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.440
 minecraft mountains were a bit ridiculous 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.500
 I think I mean how many others 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.769
 mountain is actually an almost obstacle 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.200
 insurmountable just thousands of meters 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.570
 microsoft instead the mountains were high 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 a hundred cubic is sometimes a 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.170
 but a little bit more to be but it was not 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.370
 not even real mountains these are true 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.920
 mountains 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.500
 in short, look at how cordial loyalty 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.859
 these mountains so i like them 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.530
 they create precisely this variety in the 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.290
 landscape that helps the gameplay I don't know 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.489
 I'm playing on a server 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.370
 we will hardly find an amplified one 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.750
 because they require too high resources 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.670
 of the pci and the server 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.530
 but let's say we play in 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.910
 multiplayer and there is a guy you are 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.430
 made the base there on top 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.320
 or one builds a castle in 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.049
 top of a mountain of this kind us 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.989
 in short, we have to skip it a lot more 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.060
 nice to do if you play 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.550
 always in amplified i 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.130
 another novelty that I really like and the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.020
 change in the controls to sprint first 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.750
 it was necessary to proceed forward to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.250
 start sprinting now instead 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.599
 can also press control 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.880
 so we're moving forward 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.880
 we press control our my beginning 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.650
 sprint ara and it's something really that 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.750
 it should have been there from day one 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.389
 the sprint system with forward ahead 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.010
 I've always been disgusted if I have to be 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.590
 sincere makes no sense 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.560
 to tell the truth, I almost almost reversed 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.740
 and I would like to put the sprint on the upper case 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.580
 and the kuchar clashes, however, I have to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.370
 to think 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.050
 in any case, for now both will remain 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.639
 the commands you can you know how to do forward 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.460
 forward if you run it 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.470
 or press control and I think it is the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.470
 undoubtedly the best is control 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.570
 this simplifies me so much 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.380
 the game that I'm really happy with 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.020
 finally there is the last novelty of which 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.300
 I want to talk today is the pack or the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.220
 puffer fish than an object completely 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.460
 useless but I enjoy the fact that there 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.760
 whether we eat it our little man 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.110
 starts to go crazy but in the trip more 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.610
 deep ever seen 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:15.390
 ence to sbarellare has so completely 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.120
 it's useless but it poisons the effect 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.760
 in a sense it vanishes after a while and everything 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.860
 what remains is a nice poison of 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.710
 level 4 but it doesn't kill us there 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.060
 he carried at least half of you this heart 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.100
 you say it makes no sense that there is 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.360
 indeed it is true however before 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.789
 everything amuses me the fact that it is 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.610
 present in minecraft is the second place 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.470
 through spaak resources we can give 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.139
 the same texture at power fiji a 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.389
 something else or even with other systems 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.700
 but let 's say let 's take it 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.220
 a golden apple maybe we take one 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.440
 very common golden apple and we give it the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.120
 same texture as the buffer fish 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.310
 then we do an adventure map 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.240
 where there are fights or things 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.979
 such 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.139
 and you can risk taking the apple 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.210
 of gold that can also be a 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.190
 fixed partner or not take it e 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.200
 increases variety these are an idea that 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.970
 it occurred to me right now 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.700
 to say that anyway all the things that 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.040
 there are in the game that they are maybe a 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.840
 little funny 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.880
 always good that there are because yes 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.680
 they can then be applied in many contexts 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.870
 different especially thanks 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.340
 to the introduction of rationes pack that 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.260
 is a more advanced version of the 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.820
 texture packs where they can be changed 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:29.600
 also sounds and things of this kind 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:32.480
 so all this patch is not for today 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.240
 perhaps one of the best ones 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.680
 which vary more the gameplay but everything 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.750
 what comes to an end is always 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.750
 let's remember that all these are positive 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.970
 patches are always free and given me 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.540
 this question is often asked 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.580
 also to say the question would be 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.710
 they will continue to do these endlessly 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.720
 peace or no they had said that 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.850
 they would have continued a movie there 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.760
 had been interest in the game then 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.380
 basically if we continue to 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480
 talk about it we continue to play the patches 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.160
 they will continue to arrive and I don't know if 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.100
 this is something that many will like 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.570
 but that's how it works thanks for having 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.680
 followed this video see you at 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.680
 next hello to all
