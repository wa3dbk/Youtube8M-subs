00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
 e 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.370
 the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.370
 they had all made a first choice 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.230
 of professional life today he 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.240
 start a new turning point by following 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.250
 cooking training for adults 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.660
 initially I studied 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.670
 journalism and then in the end I wanted 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.230
 specialize in journalism china have 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.420
 for twenty seven years I work in 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.830
 Muslims retired in community I 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.420
 wanted to reconvert me because I 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.890
 wanted to work in the kitchen 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.239
 traditional four activities I think 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 that I went around I saw what 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.290
 I had to see a lot of my time 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.180
 I had more to learn 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 so the direction in which I 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.930
 felt that I would be able to learn 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.640
 a lot it was that one of all 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.140
 ways cooking was a passion 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 since my childhood it was just a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.059
 question of whether I wanted to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 do my professional life or not the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.260
 thigh we are also going to the device 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.330
 is there a little bit below 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.909
 the bone a rap 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.549
 that's how I booked I mention 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.830
 it's done I will be presentable 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.909
 I did not come looking for recipes 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.690
 reproduce I was looking for 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.880
 techniques the street is here right here the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.470
 daybreak m 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.370
 after I go back all this I have more than one 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.370
 simple 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.800
 I had the closest we worked with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 three different teachers what 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.470
 sometimes allows first of all the same 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 techniques but a little bit 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.440
 different and find the one that we 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 best suits 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's true that it's a lot of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 technique is time we did not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 do going go get them that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.630
 would take years of practice 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.040
 there was the information that is in my che 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 is a demonstration where the wildlife 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.370
 practiced in loop is great and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 once we have these techniques, we have 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.960
 will we have the opportunity to have a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 creative process 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.440
 we have a whole copper material 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.060
 a variety of materials that we 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.350
 may not find in others 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 professional kitchens we will do 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.200
 but which allow us to discover 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.840
 real cooking techniques that are 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 exceptional once I know 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.450
 use this material 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 after I am adaptable in all 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.009
 environments in which I could 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.060
 find me then they are very badly 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.470
 equipped it's cool that have me containers 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.390
 cooking fat game 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.230
 partially I pay suez but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.269
 shallots 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 but apple trimmings once they 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.700
 knew well and I flambe 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 I have 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.590
 I think I want to touch 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 everything in gastronomy what is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.320
 certain is to stay in it already the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 practice is all the time 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.670
 then I would like to say a lot and by 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.810
 example cookbooks I would like 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 well it's integrating a kitchen 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.940
 traditional so type gastronomy at 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.530
 project of departure it was rather open 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.300
 a catering service and it turns out that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.620
 I met people by dint of 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 talk to me about what I had 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 want to do with an opportunity 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.800
 came up and a priori so we 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.500
 should resume with associates 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 a restaurant it is clear that this is my 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.850
 training he will have given enough 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.860
 trust me to get started with me 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 in his in this adventure it's a 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.740
 state diploma crept to pay 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.150
 so it's ferrandi 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.590
 or in another school it's the same 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.970
 thing but to have done business years said 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.770
 he specified it from source and will I 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.070
 think it's something that's 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.070
 one more
