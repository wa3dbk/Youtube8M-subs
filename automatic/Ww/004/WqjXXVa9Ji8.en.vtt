00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello I am oliver miserable and today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 the topic of water technology in the oven 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 many people come to me and ask 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.170
 Me mainly to stoves with 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.300
 Water technology of the stove with the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.140
 Water technology does not work 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.930
 really good 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.580
 why the manufacturers indicate 70 80 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.880
 percent of the heat output goes into 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 water 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 but unfortunately not true of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 Fireplace is a fun fire in the first place 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.829
 line, of course, he also makes it warm then 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 if he brings now he is on too 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 aesthetics and beauty designed that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 is called the water heat exchanger there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 are used because they are small 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 they are easier to obstruct than 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.629
 huge and the whole still nice too 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 shape 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.250
 So if I make a fire in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.379
 Wood stove with 12 steps has wood 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.899
 about 20 30 percent of the heat output 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.719
 across the disc directly in the tree between 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 15 and 20 percent over the pipe in the room 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.359
 directly and partly over the corpus 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 open 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 so it can never be that 70 there 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.390
 80 percent of westernermann stands and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.619
 The small heat exchanger can be easy 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 do not absorb the energy 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 that means they either only have them 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 a two swiss wood in it and the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 room is pleasantly warm 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.900
 the water stays relatively cold or else 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 They report wood in 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 they have a water power but there 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.100
 again the big room sauna right 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 Reasonably warm water around it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 Heating purposes can be used in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.159
 Store radiation open either one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 anyway, the heat output of his 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.110
 has about 15 to 20 hours and then in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 This period is about 50 percent of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.790
 heat into the water gives better again 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 with a brick oven where i just go 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.170
 can determine the amount of wood and me 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 can say your household 100 square meters 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.479
 they need 4k per hour and ten 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 hours are 40 kw that is ten 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.659
 kilo of wood need about the oven 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 to be burned and the whole plant 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.860
 is designed for these fires impulse 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
 Thus, they have a thrifty open 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.430
 We want to have a pleasant warmth 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.409
 a decent water performance and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.120
 they enjoy their stove 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.780
 they liked us over 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.780
