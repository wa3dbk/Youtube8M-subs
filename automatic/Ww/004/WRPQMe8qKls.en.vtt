00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.500
 hills a mixed top with a lot of sand 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.020
 pretty grass face 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.140
 could put a good rhythm for half 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.670
 of the special tip batch grip and what 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.280
 more important was to be able to open when 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.990
 when I saw that the firing squad 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.250
 I came at a quiet pace I tried 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.720
 have seen today I'm going to make a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 difference to the royal link so 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.970
 nothing now we are more inside and today has 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.190
 been a very good day for us 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.890
 keep moving forward we always throw 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.920
 very much good together 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.800
 and offered a little starting first there was 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 at the beginning a little difficult navigation we 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 we put together and they always sail from home to 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.270
 the end after passing happened 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.270
 and let's continue we are always then 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.379
 Well, it 's difficult, it 's a very 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.729
 very complicated at the beginning with the 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.919
 difficult navigation 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.300
 nothing else company we will start 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.750
 lost the track we have gotten ourselves 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.470
 holes and complicated has been difficult 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.960
 a pretty pretty long stage pretty 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.240
 complicated there were difficult areas that 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.720
 but good good well in the end we have 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.759
 lost time looking for a gps point that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.009
 few people have found in the end what 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.740
 we have found and we go together with orly 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.169
 has followed we have found the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.789
 point I think orly good does not have and 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.319
 now not so I do not know what will happen 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.629
 Normally when you do not have a point 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.310
 you have the penalty but good apart 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.849
 apart from that I think we said what 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.219
 right because that's the reason 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.650
 rally-raid and google and navigation 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.229
 is this is not looking for all the points and 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.030
 in this case nothing true of the time 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.340
 it happens but in any case a good stage 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.419
 a stage very very very complicated by 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.520
 been six hours is 40 at 22 difficult 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.030
 difficult but good happy to be of 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.870
 be here 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.460
 to a beautiful stage but very long and very 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.860
 hard 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.560
 I want another 40 we could pass it to the ni 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.509
 idea and we open track up there the 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.620
 kilometer 311 that we punctured a happened to me 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.599
 then unearthed pass I found out what 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.190
 happened again and from there on 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.440
 100 kilometers I was reaching what 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.229
 I passed and I got good at the end 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.550
 but the last the last but one gps point 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.310
 we have not had it so we have a 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.310
 15 minute ratio a pity 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.230
 why 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.390
 we would have won on the track and that for 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.550
 I was very important because today we left 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.060
 to look for the time and the truth that the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.810
 car 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.740
 at a higher level of speed that goes 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.740
 to go very well for the face
