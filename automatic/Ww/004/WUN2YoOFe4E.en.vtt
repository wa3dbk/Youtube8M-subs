eventually start taking one of these

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.469 
eventually start taking one of these
powers<00:05:19.979> so<00:05:20.130> for<00:05:20.280> example<00:05:20.370> one<00:05:20.820> move<00:05:21.060> might

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
powers so for example one move might

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.650 
powers so for example one move might
cost<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:22.139> two<00:05:22.590> orbs<00:05:22.979> and<00:05:23.130> one<00:05:23.910> move<00:05:24.210> might

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
cost to two orbs and one move might

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.440 
cost to two orbs and one move might
grant<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.440> an<00:05:25.680> org<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.729> see<00:05:26.880> what<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.030> mean<00:05:27.090> and

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
this is what gives you strategy they

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.370 
this is what gives you strategy they
basically<00:05:29.880> works<00:05:30.300> like<00:05:30.919> your<00:05:32.570> MP<00:05:33.570> from<00:05:34.080> other
