00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
this is far from the dream girl but this
is<00:02:22.400> what<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.590> thought

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
is what it is I like it and I thought

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.650 
is what it is I like it and I thought
something<00:02:25.340> short<00:02:25.810> would<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:28.030> good<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.480> my

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
something short would be good for my

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.740 
something short would be good for my
upcoming<00:02:31.120> trip<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:34.270> Phoenix<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.810> wanted

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
upcoming trip to Phoenix so I wanted

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.140 
upcoming trip to Phoenix so I wanted
something<00:02:38.750> appropriate<00:02:39.350> for<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.790> weather

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
something appropriate for the weather

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.809 
something appropriate for the weather
and<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.569> think<00:02:41.870> having<00:02:42.620> my<00:02:42.860> hair<00:02:43.100> off<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.370> neck

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
and I think having my hair off my neck

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.449 
and I think having my hair off my neck
would<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.330> good<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.530> well<00:02:46.040> let<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.220> go
