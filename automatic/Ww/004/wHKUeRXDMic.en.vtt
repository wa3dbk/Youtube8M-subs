00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
connecting to the bezel so you don't

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
connecting to the bezel so you don't
really<00:01:11.010> run<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> risk<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.630> stuffing<00:01:12.630> anything

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
really run the risk of stuffing anything

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.590

the job once you've opened the MacBook
up<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.140> should<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.590> parts<00:01:22.950> there

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
up you should see all the parts there

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210 
up you should see all the parts there
you<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> battery<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.979> hard

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you would have the battery the hard

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.740 
you would have the battery the hard
drive<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.640> we're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> replace<00:01:27.420> and

good<00:03:43.799> thing<00:03:43.949> is<00:03:44.069> they're<00:03:44.189> attached<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.669> the

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
good thing is they're attached to the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.020 
good thing is they're attached to the
plastic<00:03:45.150> piece<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:46.919> don't<00:03:47.099> need<00:03:47.189> to<00:03:47.340> go<00:03:47.729> and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
plastic piece so we don't need to go and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.319 
plastic piece so we don't need to go and
look<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.269> them<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:49.639> we<00:03:50.639> screw<00:03:51.150> those

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
look for them and we screw those

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.939 
look for them and we screw those
together<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.109> sure<00:03:52.259> the<00:03:52.409> hard<00:03:52.590> drive<00:03:52.799> is

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
together and make sure the hard drive is

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.300 
together and make sure the hard drive is
nice<00:03:53.189> and<00:03:53.370> snug<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.819> its<00:03:53.970> place<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.470> after

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
nice and snug in its place and after

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.319 
nice and snug in its place and after
this<00:03:56.639> I'll<00:03:56.849> do<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> boot<00:03:58.169> test<00:03:58.790> which<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.970> did<00:04:00.180> for

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
this I'll do a boot test which I did for

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.740 
this I'll do a boot test which I did for
the<00:04:00.419> 5400<00:04:01.199> rpm<00:04:02.129> as<00:04:02.250> well<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.639> see<00:04:02.759> if<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.000> 7200

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the 5400 rpm as well to see if the 7200

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.920 
the 5400 rpm as well to see if the 7200
really<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.400> advantageous<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.939> have<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.810> we've

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
really is advantageous to have so we've

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.659 
really is advantageous to have so we've
got<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.259> screws<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.680> we're<00:04:07.889> just<00:04:07.919> going<00:04:08.609> to

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
got the screws in we're just going to

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.449 
got the screws in we're just going to
screw<00:04:08.849> them<00:04:09.000> nice<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.389> tight<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:11.250> next

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
screw them nice and tight and the next

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.860 
screw them nice and tight and the next
step<00:04:11.609> is<00:04:11.729> quite<00:04:11.939> simple<00:04:12.239> put<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.509> bezel<00:04:12.780> back

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
step is quite simple put the bezel back

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.249 
step is quite simple put the bezel back
on<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:14.340> make<00:04:14.939> sure<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.239> put<00:04:15.509> the<00:04:15.780> hard<00:04:16.079> drive

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
on and make sure you put the hard drive

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.740 
on and make sure you put the hard drive
that<00:04:16.409> you<00:04:16.500> take<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.949> your<00:04:17.190> MacBook<00:04:17.940> Pro<00:04:18.180> in

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
that you take out of your MacBook Pro in

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.370 
that you take out of your MacBook Pro in
an<00:04:19.049> anti-static<00:04:19.789> bag<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.870> so<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
an anti-static bag and just so it

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.870 
an anti-static bag and just so it
doesn't<00:04:22.710> get<00:04:22.800> damaged<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.110> we're<00:04:25.110> done<00:04:25.880> so

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
doesn't get damaged and we're done so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.470 
doesn't get damaged and we're done so
that's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
that's

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.570 
that's
most<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:28.500> done<00:04:28.620> we'll<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:29.010> put<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> bezel

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
most of it done we'll just put the bezel

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.270 
most of it done we'll just put the bezel
back<00:04:29.670> on<00:04:30.260> or<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> backing<00:04:31.560> whatever<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.190> like

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
back on or the backing whatever you like

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.110 
back on or the backing whatever you like
to<00:04:32.430> call<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:35.010> just<00:04:35.070> goes<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.820> same

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
to call it and it just goes in the same

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.980 
to call it and it just goes in the same
way<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.690> came<00:04:36.870> out<00:04:38.210> put<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.330> back<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.720> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
way that it came out put it back on and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.850 
way that it came out put it back on and
the<00:04:40.170> screw<00:04:40.470> door<00:04:40.740> is<00:04:40.890> once<00:04:41.100> again<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> same

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the screw door is once again the same

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.760

rpm hard drives and seeing if it's
really<00:05:12.180> worth<00:05:12.330> getting<00:05:12.510> one<00:05:12.750> but<00:05:13.440> for<00:05:13.650> now

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
really worth getting one but for now

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.640
