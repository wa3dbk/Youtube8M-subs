00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:50.569

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.400
 is there a hotel or bar that we could 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:06.170
 get settled or a waiter or bartenders 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.090
 honestly as i remember anyone 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.180
 no it's like you are all my friends now 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.070
 unemployed seems to me at night someone 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.840
 knocked on the door can the postman brought 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.200
 let's go see an ad 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.140
 will be 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.060
 listen let's try for a long time we are not 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.780
 looked in there by the way here it is mail 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.789
 let's take a look does love here 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 the newspaper is cool let's probably almost 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.979
 let's see maybe there are for us 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.490
 jobs 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.170
 let's go close the unexpected guest to us 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 Not needed 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.969
 totally agree so well let's start 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.100
 the first we have is a janitor salary one 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.780
 diamond after all i'm not honestly a janitor 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.429
 this is not a prestigious profession, although we all 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.380
 life sought a prestigious profession 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.579
 output u is more suitable 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.950
 go ahead postman 2 diamonds a day well 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.149
 Basically twice a day is good but 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.499
 I think you can find something better. 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.630
 ad publishers are required one and a half 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.939
 a diamond a day basically seems to me that 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.670
 of these three is the best postman and 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.100
 look here empty page further 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 words country something like there don't believe i would 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.350
 on vacancies can not be in the newspaper so 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.360
 little for 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.530
 usually at least four as far as i know 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 so the cleaner is also required 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.960
 2 about 10 pages here something is written 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.000
 it will be enough to pay 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.330
 for a whole month for an apartment it's a day 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.430
 not yet a man know something where it is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.050
 villa number five i know we remember 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.360
 Once you were there a long time ago 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.210
 as far as I remember the sixth grade is on the right 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.800
 for filling in the golden hall Coyle what 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.990

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.840

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.370

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.220
 lock the door so no one can 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 come on come on then it seems to me long 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 the path will be on maybe we are not even here 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.560
 will return if it will earn such 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.440
 number of diamonds 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.030

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.000
 the sheet seems to me that it is here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.250
 really not enough 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.630
 I wonder what kind of work I honestly 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 saying without even knowing what's behind 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.350

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.530

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.090
 well, although they are the same without any 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.910

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.890
