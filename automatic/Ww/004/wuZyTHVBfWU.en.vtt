00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 my hello to the audience and cordially 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 welcome again to a small one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.690
 tutorial to gta 5 on the pc i have 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 you already explained for example how 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 your character on the pc 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 could also transfer that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.950
 certainly some can use 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.790
 Some may not think so 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.260
 some maybe already 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.420
 and that's why there is a small one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.710
 tip to gta 5 for the people the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.180
 did not know or do not know how 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 it works as you do your own 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 could import music into the game 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 radio station ser quite well I 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.220
 you now mostly from the net play 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.810
 First, because I always mislead 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 I'm going to sing along with me 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.380
 do not have that at ps3 let's play 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.670
 But there the music is playing and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 so far, no video is blocked 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.380
 been 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 but most network players do that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.649
 Anyway, music is not always around 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 to somehow get problems with gema 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.870
 or whatever 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.430
 that's why I currently have one but you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 can also play his own music 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 paste on the pc and though pretty 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.670
 easy for that he just goes on yours 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 computer on the system disk at 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.739
 me it's my ssd So c windows is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 usually the plate then you go too 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.879

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 Your name is then in your name with me

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.350
 Of course probably different okay 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.299

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.030
 own documents or on 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.409
 jockey document depending on how that works 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.240
 you just say English or German 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.009
 and try her here in the long 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 list with games and savegames around 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 rockstar games that is under ground 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.810
 probably and accordingly something 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.580
 below moment where we have there 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 payne 3 and especially gta 5 there 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 Let's go for it and then we have it here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.159
 even user music is the folder 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 now even more 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.710
 So that's the address c username 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.560
 own documents rockstar games gta 5 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 user music and packed in this folder 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.170
 now simply the music purely on it by the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.520
 I wanted to take a game now 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 Just so now I just have it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.729
 six songs inserted a bit 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 mischmash among others the yes 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.520
 you already know that already knows everything 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.560
 from videos and now we go back 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.570
 into the game now we go into the game 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 In the game, you then go to settings 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 and then of course on audio or 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 should then at least the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.060
 I 've got music volume sometime 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.300
 it had always been out because I like it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.310
 said I played without music so 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.590
 music loudness the superscript and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.410
 then you go down to quick search 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 to perform music 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.410
 Now he's looking for some times 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.790
 songs he should find there in the folder 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.230
 So now we have found our music 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.910
 and then he goes to radio station there 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.270
 up there is my radio out now 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:29.000
 makes just here on my radio 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.830
 euro victory - and you can still if 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.650
 you want to change the radium mode 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 you can just do the music 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.780
 sequentially one after the other is gone 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.790
 just like when he backgrounds 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.230
 playlist the music is after 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.490
 lies after song runs but you can 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 also randomly set then that becomes 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.420
 whole made so cross messed up 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.130
 the songs are played from the folder and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.300
 you can even radio others then 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.170
 really like a radio station do 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 I come that way too 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.740
 moderations in between and something with 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.890
 your music then in life again and again 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
 so quieter and there we go 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.590
 just go back to the game 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.850
 then he will have here the radio the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 Now just turn your radio off 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.620
 it's radio up here and it's up there 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.380
 right now also radio so you hear 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.890
 right now any 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.000
 entertainment broadcast and so on 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.670
 wait a bit and then 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.750
 should run like music right away 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.280
 and now one is just now I hear 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.630
 my music I have opinions now 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.180
 taken look those are mine 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.709
 effector dealer google so now it runs 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 at least my own music and is 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.720
 not very difficult though 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.670
 maybe that did not know yet 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.020
 the pc very easily possible so if he 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.000
 gladly you would like to hear again 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.950
 That could be easy in these now 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.930
 reinstall the folder once in the game 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.280
 music search then make the actual 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.660
 make radio signals and already running the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.950
 music and if it still like a 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.780
 radiosender should sound 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.040
 then he just puts that on the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.570
 mode radio and then you have 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.510
 in between also normal moderation 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.770
 that was great to gta 5 i hope so 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.320
 could possibly help you with this 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.310
 some people did not know that yet and 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.810
