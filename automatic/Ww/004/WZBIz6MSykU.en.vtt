00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
like it the only thing I don't like is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170

this<00:01:55.439> rear<00:01:55.770> blade<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.909> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
loose and it falls off quite a bit so I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
loose and it falls off quite a bit so I
think<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> these<00:02:01.560> days<00:02:01.619> I'll<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.100> glue

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
think one of these days I'll just glue

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
think one of these days I'll just glue
it<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.939> perfectly<00:02:03.420> stationary<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it on so it's perfectly stationary but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
it on so it's perfectly stationary but
you<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.310> able<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> turn<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.000> that's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you will be able to turn but that's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.150 
you will be able to turn but that's
alright

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
alright

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.400

this little of rear wing here also is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
this little of rear wing here also is
pretty<00:02:10.739> loose<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.190> won't<00:02:11.430> come<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
pretty loose it won't come off but it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.309 
pretty loose it won't come off but it
just<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.050> few

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
downside also I wish they would have put

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.479 
downside also I wish they would have put
more<00:02:19.499> effort<00:02:19.829> and<00:02:19.980> you're<00:02:20.069> making<00:02:20.340> these

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
more effort and you're making these

a<00:02:22.049> little<00:02:22.980> more<00:02:24.799> secure<00:02:25.799> because<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.939> would<00:02:27.180> say

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
a little more secure because I would say

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.339 
a little more secure because I would say
this<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:29.340> comes<00:02:29.579> with<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.819> stand<00:02:30.200> near<00:02:31.200> a

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.309 
this also comes with a stand near a
provides<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.920> stand<00:02:32.250> um<00:02:32.989> where<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.170> easily

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
just place the helicopter on via this

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.839 
just place the helicopter on via this
little<00:02:41.329> port<00:02:42.329> right<00:02:42.689> there<00:02:46.280> will<00:02:47.280> hard<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.639> see

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
little port right there will hard to see

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.000 
little port right there will hard to see
but<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.750> around<00:02:48.959> there<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.530> stays<00:02:49.799> on<00:02:49.950> pretty

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
but it's around there it stays on pretty

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.099 
but it's around there it stays on pretty
nicely<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.849> looks<00:02:51.000> good<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.239> top<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:51.810> stand

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
nicely it looks good on top of the stand

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.740 
nicely it looks good on top of the stand
I<00:02:52.519> like<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:54.650> stan<00:02:55.650> has<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.069> label<00:02:56.480> 160th<00:02:57.480> scale

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
I like it stan has the label 160th scale

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.170 
I like it stan has the label 160th scale
scores<00:02:58.199> case<00:02:58.579> 860<00:02:59.599> Seahawk<00:03:04.549> but<00:03:05.549> overall<00:03:05.849> it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
scores case 860 Seahawk but overall it's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.729 
scores case 860 Seahawk but overall it's
a<00:03:06.209> pretty<00:03:06.419> nice<00:03:06.629> model<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.169> really<00:03:07.409> like<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
a pretty nice model I really like the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.199 
a pretty nice model I really like the
details<00:03:08.129> it's<00:03:09.030> got<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> few<00:03:09.389> little<00:03:09.449> flaws

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
details it's got a few little flaws

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.429 
details it's got a few little flaws
dealing<00:03:12.209> with<00:03:12.359> these<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:12.870> loose<00:03:13.049> parts

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
dealing with these little loose parts

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.149 
dealing with these little loose parts
back<00:03:13.680> here

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
back here

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.610 
back here
they<00:03:14.669> don't<00:03:14.879> really<00:03:15.060> fall<00:03:15.449> off<00:03:15.629> which<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.079> you

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
they don't really fall off which is you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.140 
they don't really fall off which is you
know<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:16.980> alright<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.669> think<00:03:18.000> I'll

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
know it's alright but I think I'll

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.360 
know it's alright but I think I'll
superglue<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.259> back<00:03:19.500> blade<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:19.979> so<00:03:20.280> it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
superglue this back blade on so it

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.740 
superglue this back blade on so it
doesn't<00:03:20.699> fall<00:03:20.849> off<00:03:20.909> it<00:03:21.239> feels<00:03:21.359> like<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.720> might

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
doesn't fall off it feels like it might

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.990 
doesn't fall off it feels like it might
been<00:03:22.409> getting<00:03:22.829> looser<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.310> looser<00:03:23.489> as<00:03:23.790> time

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
been getting looser and looser as time

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.429 
been getting looser and looser as time
goes<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.829> otherwise<00:03:25.829> it's<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.129> nice<00:03:26.340> model<00:03:26.639> um

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
goes on otherwise it's a nice model um

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.990 
goes on otherwise it's a nice model um
really<00:03:28.439> liked<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.919> very<00:03:29.159> authentic<00:03:29.699> looking

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
really liked it very authentic looking

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.280 
really liked it very authentic looking
great<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.540> collector<00:03:31.169> of<00:03:31.199> any<00:03:31.620> age

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
great for a collector of any age

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.409 
great for a collector of any age
preferably<00:03:34.290> clawed<00:03:34.889> older<00:03:35.699> collector<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
preferably clawed older collector and

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.409 
preferably clawed older collector and
now<00:03:36.599> if<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.680> give<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.909> younger<00:03:39.090> child

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
now if you give this to a younger child

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.289 
now if you give this to a younger child
you<00:03:39.689> might<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:41.430> know<00:03:41.549> tear<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.849> couple<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
you might you know tear a couple of

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.999 
you might you know tear a couple of
these<00:03:42.359> little<00:03:42.569> parts<00:03:42.959> off<00:03:43.169> but<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.680> pretty

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.009 
these little parts off but it's pretty

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.270 
these little parts off but it's pretty
strong<00:03:44.340> um<00:03:44.930> very<00:03:45.930> realistic<00:03:46.590> looking<00:03:46.919> for<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
strong um very realistic looking for the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.300 
strong um very realistic looking for the
price<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.819> about<00:03:48.030> twenty<00:03:48.509> dollars<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.310> very

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
price it's about twenty dollars so very

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.819 
price it's about twenty dollars so very
very<00:03:50.699> reasonable<00:03:51.000> big<00:03:51.989> model<00:03:52.379> too

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
very reasonable big model too

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.110 
very reasonable big model too
um<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:54.949> I<00:03:55.949> like<00:03:55.979> it<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.370> lot<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.609> think<00:03:56.849> it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
um and I like it a lot I think it's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.830 
um and I like it a lot I think it's
great<00:03:57.329> it's<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.109> as<00:03:58.639> good<00:03:59.639> as<00:03:59.969> you<00:04:00.599> know<00:04:00.719> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
great it's not as good as you know the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.539 
great it's not as good as you know the
more<00:04:01.019> expensive<00:04:01.409> ones<00:04:01.859> you'll<00:04:02.069> see<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.430> are

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
more expensive ones you'll see that are

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.909 
more expensive ones you'll see that are
well<00:04:02.849> over<00:04:03.000> $200<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.169> it's<00:04:04.319> it's<00:04:04.680> definitely

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
well over $200 but it's it's definitely

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.159 
well over $200 but it's it's definitely
