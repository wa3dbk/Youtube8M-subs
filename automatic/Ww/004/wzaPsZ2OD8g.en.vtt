sound better than they ever did which is
sort<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> peculiar<00:01:13.580> peculiar<00:01:14.580> notion<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
sort of a peculiar peculiar notion this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.820 
sort of a peculiar peculiar notion this
sense<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.759> l5<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.090> rah<00:01:18.720> malos<00:01:19.259> was

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sense this this l5 of rah malos was

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820 
sense this this l5 of rah malos was
sitting<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.720> chart<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.900> recording<00:01:22.350> chart<00:01:22.619> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
sitting on a chart a recording chart in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.630 
sitting on a chart a recording chart in
his<00:01:23.070> case<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.150> imprinted<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.640> he

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
his case and it imprinted and he

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
his case and it imprinted and he
originally<00:01:27.090> wanted<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.450> refinish<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.049> I've

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
originally wanted to refinish but I've

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.539 
originally wanted to refinish but I've
talked<00:01:28.380> him<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:28.590> leaving<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.369> there

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
talked him into leaving that on there

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.200 
talked him into leaving that on there
because<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.420> colorful

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
because I think that's kind of colorful

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
because I think that's kind of colorful
but<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.740> fairly<00:01:35.130> whipped

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
but some really some fairly whipped

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.399 
but some really some fairly whipped
looking<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> mean<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.750> McPherson

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
looking I mean this this McPherson

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.420 
looking I mean this this McPherson
probably<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:37.860> never<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> put<00:01:38.400> back

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
probably will never get put back

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
probably will never get put back
together<00:01:38.759> again<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.079> too

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
together again because it's just too

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.980 
together again because it's just too
much<00:01:40.380> work<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.090> for<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> replaceable<00:01:42.630> guitar

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.719 

yeah<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.560> thing<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.549> haven't

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
yeah and the thing about it I haven't

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
yeah and the thing about it I haven't
talked<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> him<00:02:06.210> about<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.540> yet<00:02:06.690> because<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
talked to him about it yet because I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.480 
talked to him about it yet because I
don't<00:02:07.080> get<00:02:07.350> him<00:02:07.440> too<00:02:07.619> optimistic<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
don't get him too optimistic but the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
don't get him too optimistic but the
thing<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:10.400> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:12.120> look<00:02:12.330> at

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
thing about it is that if you look at

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.630 
thing about it is that if you look at
like<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.110> instance<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.530> guitar<00:02:13.860> three<00:02:14.459> days

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
like for instance that guitar three days

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.059 
like for instance that guitar three days
after<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.780> flood<00:02:16.080> or<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> day<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.680> came<00:02:16.890> out

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
after the flood or the day it came out

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.270 
after the flood or the day it came out
it<00:02:17.310> looked<00:02:17.790> absolutely<00:02:18.090> hopeless<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.890> little

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it looked absolutely hopeless but little

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.699 
it looked absolutely hopeless but little
by<00:02:20.370> little<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:21.239> dried<00:02:21.630> out<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.110> also<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.470> push

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
by little it dried out and also we push

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.260 
by little it dried out and also we push
things<00:02:22.950> back<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.489> where<00:02:23.520> they<00:02:23.730> ought<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.090> in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
things back to where they ought to be in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.650 
things back to where they ought to be in
and<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.860> won't<00:02:26.040> look<00:02:26.310> cleaner<00:02:27.150> than<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.569> did

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and it won't look cleaner than it did

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.090 
and it won't look cleaner than it did
before<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.110> flood<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> won't<00:02:28.739> look<00:02:28.860> bad

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
before the flood but it won't look bad

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.920 
before the flood but it won't look bad
so<00:02:29.370> anyway<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:31.230> world<00:02:31.410> goes<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.100> a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
so anyway the world goes on this is a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.630 
so anyway the world goes on this is a
this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> different<00:02:34.950> sort<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> thing<00:02:35.519> this

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
this is a different sort of thing this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.920 
this is a different sort of thing this
is<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.850> Les<00:02:36.120> Paul<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.690> John<00:02:37.200> Jorgensen's<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is a Les Paul of John Jorgensen's and it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
is a Les Paul of John Jorgensen's and it
had<00:02:40.050> had<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:41.180> inappropriate<00:02:42.180> things

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
had had a lot of inappropriate things

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
had had a lot of inappropriate things
done<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.290> switch<00:02:43.830> cavity<00:02:44.310> had

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
done to it the the switch cavity had

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.310 
done to it the the switch cavity had
been<00:02:44.519> opened<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.600> who<00:02:45.750> knows<00:02:45.959> what<00:02:46.019> reason

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
been opened up for who knows what reason

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.430 
been opened up for who knows what reason
you<00:02:46.769> know<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.920> put<00:02:47.070> more<00:02:47.280> stuff<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
you know to put more stuff in it and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.050 
you know to put more stuff in it and
this<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.650> badly<00:02:50.100> cracked<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.790> as

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this was badly cracked this was as

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.840 
this was badly cracked this was as
cracked<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.600> Peters<00:02:51.930> guitar<00:02:52.320> but<00:02:53.280> we've

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
cracked as Peters guitar but we've

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.670 
cracked as Peters guitar but we've
pushed<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.600> back<00:02:54.750> together<00:02:54.930> again<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.560> he

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
pushed it back together again and he

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.350 
pushed it back together again and he
wanted<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.070> refinish<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.700> because<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> black

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
wanted to refinish it because the black

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.880 
wanted to refinish it because the black
was<00:02:57.600> already<00:02:57.989> messed<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:58.739> we're

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
was already messed up and so we're

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.509 
was already messed up and so we're
getting<00:02:59.040> ready<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.920> with

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
getting ready to do that but this with

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.190 
getting ready to do that but this with
this<00:03:02.670> guitar<00:03:02.880> he's<00:03:03.209> able<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.450> he'll<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.019> able

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this guitar he's able to he'll be able

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.140 
this guitar he's able to he'll be able
to<00:03:04.260> kind<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> go<00:03:04.620> back<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.980> time<00:03:05.160> he'll<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.030> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to kind of go back in time he'll get it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.509 
to kind of go back in time he'll get it
back<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.480> what<00:03:06.660> he'll<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.440> able<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.709> erase<00:03:08.040> to

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
back to what he'll be able to erase to

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.520 
back to what he'll be able to erase to
some<00:03:08.790> extent<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.930> decisions<00:03:10.440> he<00:03:10.590> no<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:12.530> don't

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
some extent the decisions he no I don't

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.020 
some extent the decisions he no I don't
know<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.680> he<00:03:13.799> made<00:03:13.980> them<00:03:14.130> or<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:14.640> some<00:03:14.910> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
know if he made them or not but some of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.640 
know if he made them or not but some of
the<00:03:15.090> unwise<00:03:15.450> decisions<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.170> somebody<00:03:16.470> made

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the unwise decisions that somebody made

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
the unwise decisions that somebody made
along<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:16.980> life<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.489> guitar<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.560> it's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
along the life for this guitar so it's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.190 
along the life for this guitar so it's
not<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> other<00:03:20.010> world
