00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.179
 there are times when for safety 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.320
 yes 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.320
 it is advisable to accelerate thoroughly 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 occurs in normal situations like 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 join a fast track 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 - often we also have to accelerate 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.770
 background to make a hole for someone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.770
 that you have made a mistake 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.650
 or to face slopes in order to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.800
 that the car does not lose too much 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 speed 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.449
 accelerating to the bottom is not just stepping on 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
 bottom the pedal to get the maximum 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.760
 acceleration of the car sometimes you have to 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.219
 do something else 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800
 the acceleration of a car depends on its 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.089
 maximum power among other factors 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.710
 when we buy a car that has 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.289
 example 100 horsepower maximum 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.780
 we only have those figures if 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.729
 meet two conditions one is that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 effectively we bring the accelerator 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.780
 thought out the other is that the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 engine regime reach a certain 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.149
 level the so-called power regime 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149
 maximum 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.990
 therefore there are two instruments that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.450
 they serve to achieve the maximum 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 acceleration the accelerator pedal and the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 gear shift lever 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.420
 when we are going to need the power 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 maximum of the car we must select the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 march that allows us to reach that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.230
 maximum power regime the regime of 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 maximum power is usually close to 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.030
 maximum rate that is able to reach 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.770
 the engine is can not be maintained 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.630
 the acceleration far beyond the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 maximum power regime we seek 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.920
 therefore it does not always happen that the best 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.770
 way to accelerate is to start doing it 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.390
 in the shortest possible march on 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.120
 all if the engine has turbo compressor 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.100
 be it gasoline or diesel the best 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.750
 strategy is usually to start accelerating 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.160
 still receives moderate 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080
 that is, if we are going to start a 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.000
 overtaking and the second makes the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.590
 engine turn too fast with 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.680
 often it's much better to start 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.300
 accelerate in third this c4 picasso 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.300
 It has a turbocharged engine 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.520
 gasoline here we see an acceleration of 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.550
 100 to 120 kilometers now if we start 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 in second speed at 4700 revolutions 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.090
 per minute 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.300
 and this is the same range of 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.290
 speed but starting in third to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.290
 3300 revolutions per minute 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.770
 to get a good acceleration not 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 you just have to know how to get the car out 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.630
 hair that you also have to 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.700
 take meters to the road 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 we saw it in the chapter on where 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.060
 be placed before overtaking where 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.690
 We are talking about the convenience of 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.760
 stand far away 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.790
 when you have to join a road 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.940
 quick you have to use the same tactic 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.070
 take advantage of all available space 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.840
 when you reach an acceleration lane so 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.580
 soon as there is visibility you have to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.380
 control if other vehicles come by 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.069
 the fast track and especially to what 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.170
 speed is approaching 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.370
 if other vehicles are approaching and not 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.379
 we will be able to incorporate them 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.430
 immediately it is best to wait for 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.430
 acceleration lane principle 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.090
 if on the contrary we enter the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.700
 acceleration lane and we are moving forward 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.770
 slowly it may happen that we get to the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.680
 end of it without having been surpassed 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.330
 for the vehicle that is approaching is 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.950
 we have spent the space we had 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.950
 to accelerate without actually doing it 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.340
 another error when joining is 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.530
 circulate very close to the preceding car 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.629
 if we do this and that vehicle does not 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 accelerates enough neither us 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.530
 we can do it 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
 it is better to go very slowly and even 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.820
 slow down so that the vehicle that we 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.310
 precedes in the acceleration lane it 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.410
 separate once it is sufficiently 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.830
 far we will have more space to 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.830
 speed up 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 and speaking of incorporations there is a 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.790
 custom that makes our life easier 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.560
 all leave space for the vehicle that 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.709
 will incorporate with a perspective 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.780
 altruistic to do so is a courtesy and 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.370
 with a selfish perspective it is also 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.110
 preferable to do so because doing the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.949
 more fluid traffic benefits everyone 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.949
 even the selfish
