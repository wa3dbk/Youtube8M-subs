00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
doesn't mean you might but I imagine
that<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.939> most<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> us<00:01:39.360> it'll<00:01:39.840> probably<00:01:39.990> go

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that for most of us it'll probably go

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.620 
that for most of us it'll probably go
down<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.150> panic

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
down like this what what do you panic

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.440 
down like this what what do you panic
everyone<00:01:43.619> panic<00:01:44.159> huh

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.060 

and<00:01:47.960> I'm<00:01:48.049> sure<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.439> we<00:01:48.560> wanted<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:48.860> help

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
and I'm sure that if we wanted to help

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.679 
and I'm sure that if we wanted to help
we<00:01:49.280> probably<00:01:49.610> wouldn't<00:01:50.060> actually<00:01:50.240> be<00:01:50.509> that

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
we probably wouldn't actually be that

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.190 
we probably wouldn't actually be that
