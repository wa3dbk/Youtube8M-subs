against because was so different because
at<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> time<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.170> had<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.410> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> shoot<00:02:55.769> it

at the time we had to kind of shoot it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.559 
at the time we had to kind of shoot it
was<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.160> limited<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.849> knew<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.239> was<00:02:57.329> gonna<00:02:57.480> be

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
was so limited I knew there was gonna be

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.410 
was so limited I knew there was gonna be
problems<00:02:58.349> things<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.370> didn't<00:02:59.609> expect<00:03:00.299> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
problems things that we didn't expect to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.449 
problems things that we didn't expect to
happen<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.349> we<00:03:01.440> figured<00:03:01.739> them<00:03:01.829> out<00:03:01.890> before<00:03:02.340> we

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
happen but we figured them out before we

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.920 
happen but we figured them out before we
actually<00:03:02.670> started<00:03:02.879> shooting<00:03:03.299> well

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.430 
just acting - a big blue cavern
I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.480> lot<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.630> people<00:03:37.900> don't<00:03:37.990> make<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
I think a lot of people don't make this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.930 
I think a lot of people don't make this
much<00:03:38.650> effort<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.250> films<00:03:39.700> anymore<00:03:41.790> I've<00:03:42.790> never

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
much effort in films anymore I've never

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.970 
much effort in films anymore I've never

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
seen anyone who's used a technology we

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.500 
seen anyone who's used a technology we

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
know we have at our fingertips in

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.080 
know we have at our fingertips in
computers<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:47.530> artfully<00:03:48.370> disgracefully

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
computers this artfully disgracefully

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.150

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.589 

it's<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.909> dead<00:03:58.090> end<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:59.530> be<00:03:59.650> there<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.599> think

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
it's a dead end to be there I think
