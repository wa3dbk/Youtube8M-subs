when you buy bulk synthetic hair most of

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.239 
when you buy bulk synthetic hair most of
the<00:00:12.629> time<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.169> to<00:00:13.289> come<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:14.009> pretty

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
the time it's going to come with pretty

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.030 
the time it's going to come with pretty
blunt<00:00:14.610> ends<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.290> this<00:00:16.290> can<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.560> problematic

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
blunt ends and this can be problematic

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.980 
blunt ends and this can be problematic
when<00:00:17.340> you're<00:00:17.490> trying<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.790> blend<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.420> an

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
when you're trying to blend it into an

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260 
when you're trying to blend it into an
already<00:00:19.350> existing<00:00:19.650> hair<00:00:20.520> styles<00:00:20.910> such<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.120> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
already existing hair styles such as a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.990 
already existing hair styles such as a
weaved<00:00:21.990> extension<00:00:22.620> set<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.190> into<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.730> natural

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
weaved extension set or into the natural

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420 
weaved extension set or into the natural
hair<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.470> need<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.770> do<00:00:25.950> instead<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
hair so what we need to do instead of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.760 
hair so what we need to do instead of
keeping<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.600> blunt<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.290> we

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
keeping it all very blunt like this we

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.770 
keeping it all very blunt like this we
need<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.950> shuffle<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> fiber<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.570> has

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
need to shuffle the fiber so that it has

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
need to shuffle the fiber so that it has
some<00:00:31.050> nice<00:00:32.420> fine<00:00:33.499> refined<00:00:34.499> ends<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.789> way<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
some nice fine refined ends the way that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.590 
some nice fine refined ends the way that
we<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.469> fiber<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.600> we

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
we do this is we take the fiber and we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.549 
we do this is we take the fiber and we
split<00:00:39.929> it<00:00:40.019> into<00:00:40.199> two<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.879> separate<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.559> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
split it into two you separate it and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.439 
split it into two you separate it and
then<00:00:47.129> instead<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.519> placing<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.089> right<00:00:48.120> back<00:00:48.390> on

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
then instead of placing it right back on

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.849 
then instead of placing it right back on
top<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.870> each<00:00:48.929> other<00:00:49.019> are<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.769> to

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
top of each other are actually going to

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.819 
top of each other are actually going to
shift<00:00:50.100> slightly<00:00:50.879> forward<00:00:51.469> place<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.649> top

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
shift slightly forward place it on top

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.559 
shift slightly forward place it on top
fan<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.729> out<00:00:53.789> again<00:00:54.890> pull<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> apart<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.579> then

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
fan it out again pull it apart and then

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.689 
fan it out again pull it apart and then
shift<00:00:58.379> again<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.339> opposite

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
shift again but this way in the opposite

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
shift again but this way in the opposite
direction<00:00:59.819> so<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> keep

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
direction so we're going to keep

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
direction so we're going to keep
repeating<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.729> few<00:01:03.149> times<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.810> only

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
repeating that a few times so not only

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
repeating that a few times so not only
is<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.210> give<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.360> nice<00:01:09.810> tapered

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
is this going to give you nice tapered

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
is this going to give you nice tapered
ends<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:10.799> give<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.219> a<00:01:11.250> little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
ends it will actually give you a little

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.749 
ends it will actually give you a little
bit<00:01:11.579> more<00:01:11.700> length<00:01:15.350> right<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.560> i'm<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
bit more length right now i'm using the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.249 
bit more length right now i'm using the
shapeshifter<00:01:18.360> fiber<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
shapeshifter fiber so you can see it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
shapeshifter fiber so you can see it
separates<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.369> easily<00:01:20.670> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
separates really really easily your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
separates really really easily your
connect<00:01:21.479> Lon's<00:01:21.750> will<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.770> more

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
connect Lon's will be a little bit more

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.319 
connect Lon's will be a little bit more
work<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.219> they<00:01:23.369> tend<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> grab<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.180> little

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
work because they tend to grab a little

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.020 
work because they tend to grab a little
bit<00:01:24.509> more<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:26.009> they're<00:01:26.159> pretty<00:01:26.369> easy<00:01:26.490> too

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
bit more but they're pretty easy too

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:42.850 
bit more but they're pretty easy too
once<00:01:27.719> you<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> hang<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.320> things

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.330 

okay<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:46.260> there<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.160> going<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
okay and from there I'm just going to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.469 
okay and from there I'm just going to
give<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.180> column

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
give it a little bit of a column

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.800 
give it a little bit of a column
together<00:01:50.000> make<00:01:51.000> sure<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.540> have

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
together make sure that we don't have

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.109 
together make sure that we don't have
any<00:01:51.990> lumps<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.920> completes<00:01:56.430> our<00:01:56.700> fiber

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
any lumps and that completes our fiber

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
any lumps and that completes our fiber
