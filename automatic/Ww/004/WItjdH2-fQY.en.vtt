ingredients are what makes this product

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.610 
ingredients are what makes this product
fantastic<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.820> explain<00:00:39.510> why<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.320> talk

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
fantastic and I'll explain why as I talk

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
fantastic and I'll explain why as I talk
through<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.040> ingredients<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> first

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
through the ingredients so the first

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.619 
through the ingredients so the first
ingredient<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.440> 12<00:00:43.770> grams<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.309> grape<00:00:44.700> seed<00:00:44.730> now

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
ingredient is 12 grams of grape seed now

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
ingredient is 12 grams of grape seed now
grape<00:00:45.989> seed<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> fantastic<00:00:47.430> for

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
grape seed is fantastic for

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.479 
grape seed is fantastic for
strengthening<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.750> blood<00:00:49.020> vessels<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
strengthening the blood vessels in the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.610 
strengthening the blood vessels in the
case<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.940> rosacea<00:00:51.329> blood<00:00:51.960> vessels<00:00:52.440> are

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
case of rosacea blood vessels are

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.540 
case of rosacea blood vessels are
weakened<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:54.180> hyper<00:00:54.750> reactive<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.100> what

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
weakened and then hyper reactive so what

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
weakened and then hyper reactive so what
the<00:00:56.670> grapeseed<00:00:57.210> does<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.750> strengthen<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the grapeseed does is strengthen the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.670 
the grapeseed does is strengthen the
blood<00:00:58.829> vessels<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> minimizes<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
blood vessels and minimizes the the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
blood vessels and minimizes the the
reactivity<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.570> blood

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
reactivity if you like of that blood

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.100 
reactivity if you like of that blood
vessel<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.320> capillary<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> skin<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> both

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
vessel or capillary in the skin so both

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
vessel or capillary in the skin so both
with<00:01:07.380> allergic<00:01:08.100> sensitive<00:01:08.729> skin<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> rosacea

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
with allergic sensitive skin and rosacea

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.679 
with allergic sensitive skin and rosacea
we<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> strengthen<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> blood<00:01:12.240> vessels

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
we want to strengthen the blood vessels

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
we want to strengthen the blood vessels
and<00:01:12.840> minimize<00:01:13.610> reactions<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.790> hyper

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and minimize reactions or hyper

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
and minimize reactions or hyper
reactions<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.170> sensitivity<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.520> blood

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
reactions and sensitivity in that blood

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.899 
reactions and sensitivity in that blood
vessel<00:01:17.790> supply<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.860> 12<00:01:20.220> grams<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
vessel supply so at 12 grams this is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
vessel supply so at 12 grams this is
quite<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> strong<00:01:21.630> dose<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.369> what's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
quite a strong dose but it's what's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
quite a strong dose but it's what's
needed<00:01:24.380> for<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.950> effect<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.750> an

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
needed for for that effect to get an

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.020 
needed for for that effect to get an
effect<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.439> rosacea<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.729> product

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.350 
effect with rosacea with this product
we're<00:01:30.479> looking<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.900> three<00:01:31.290> months<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:32.100> least

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
we're looking at three months at least

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
we're looking at three months at least
for<00:01:33.360> sensitive<00:01:33.869> skin<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> started

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
for sensitive skin and when I started

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
for sensitive skin and when I started
taking<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> month<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
taking it it was as little as a month to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.920 
taking it it was as little as a month to
really<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> dampening<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.600> skin

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really see a dampening down of skin

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.530 
really see a dampening down of skin
reactions<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.430> second<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> Polly

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
reactions the second thing is Polly

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.319 
reactions the second thing is Polly
gonna<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> resveratrol<00:01:44.460> product

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
gonna and this is a resveratrol product

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.170 
gonna and this is a resveratrol product
so<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:46.079> 9<00:01:46.290> grams<00:01:46.740> standardized<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> 18

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so it's good 9 grams standardized to 18

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.249 
so it's good 9 grams standardized to 18
milligrams<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:49.790> resveratrol<00:01:50.840> resveratrol<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
milligrams of resveratrol resveratrol is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.859 
milligrams of resveratrol resveratrol is
also<00:01:52.560> found<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.130> red<00:01:53.399> wine<00:01:53.509> however<00:01:54.509> by<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
also found in red wine however by the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.630 
also found in red wine however by the
time<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> drink<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> quantity<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> red<00:01:56.399> wine

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
time you drink the quantity of red wine

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
time you drink the quantity of red wine
that's<00:01:57.060> required<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> level<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that's required to get a level of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
that's required to get a level of
resveratrol<00:01:58.710> you'd<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.700> lying<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> floor

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
resveratrol you'd be lying on the floor

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.690 
resveratrol you'd be lying on the floor
drunk<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> another<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.250> good<00:02:02.520> way
