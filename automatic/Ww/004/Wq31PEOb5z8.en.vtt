00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey and a warm welcome 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.649
 Gameplay update here no news 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 this on the league of legends homepage 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 appeared and that is the gameplay 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.469
 updating steam rolls therefore 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 mostly English that means in English 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.100
 into the prague network 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 that's what we find here is called juggernaut 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 and this update applies here before 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 especially the champions darius grenzgÃ¤nger 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 and fashion emperor for these theories 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 I am playing then quite similar here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 the comparison to big screen is drawn 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 Of course, funny rain has one 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.309
 frustrated strong like that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 gaming behavior of both teams from 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 Of course, that looks like an anti for me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 patches it comes to team tried so 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 adjust that always from the tanks 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 be virtually protected 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 and something like synonymous for other topics 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.420
 to reach and therefore one has in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 These champions are really made 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.829
 Once again I had this in German 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.809
 four because above all barrios and idols 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 still very similar in mechanics 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.510
 So there is really no waiter or 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 so but the route are similar 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 general the skills themselves 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 really very strong so you can still 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.310
 no big influence on that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 Game behavior finally as it looks 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.580
 now we have now all here fans 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200
 Not everything in the champions league 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.409
 exactly through 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.229
 important only to note I do not know where 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 the exact warning many before the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 changes like a pure one 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 Listening for improvement, that's what you're in 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.340
 grunde also taken but often want me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.659
 do not just add strength why in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 many cases have strong potential 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 we have postponed strong prince 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.079
 have moved around that thinks that the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.579
 melee careys get there that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.490
 you have very special identities with you 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.670
 situational strengths in your area 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.040
 Offer 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 you will be in the patchnotes further 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 Find details where brave only 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.750
 to make a small prospect 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.079
 make intentions 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.570
 put on it even if we do not have the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.520
 go through the entire list of changes 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 that means you me there are also nervous 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 because these skills are ultra 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 ever quite short here must 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.819
 Things about Darius Toni can do that for me 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.359
 I want to 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.540
 got hurt herbert off 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:17.549
 seriously so darius gets after you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.799
 one on maximum bleeding has brought 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.900
 it comes in rage mode and with the 1 1 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.280
 auto tech always gets one all four 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.959
 Bleeding directly or all five 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.730
 Bleeding is seen throughout the year 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.120
 really comes right after the first 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.090
 once the team has acted only off 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:41.219
 darwin and in it immediately completely full 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:43.790
 with botox in the same and yes effect or 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:46.620
 if stop with the ultimate way 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 neither multi man kill or bleeding 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.949
 then he gets from maximums cover 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:56.310
 I always like to call this match mode 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:58.530
 pretty exciting guerrilla happened 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 like to recognize the counter 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.680
 champion of the last most 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.299
 killing is for me 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.280
 the champion with highest killing screen 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:12.389
 So the series quasi kills itself 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.040
 Germany and yes and every one of his 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:18.060
 attacks this animal gets natural 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.889
 a percent to the match and in addition 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.859
 is the messiah and the ability 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.919
 is called the marian justice 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.689
 So the multi does not cause that 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.290
 normal damage but absolute 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:37.739
 damage to this one goal 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.720
 the more life and the opponent in the goal 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.900
 to carry out her life he has the more 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.000
 more harm comparable for the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.169
 spectator has the villain exactly 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.269
 just this important thing about this 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.000
 villain the villain has that with 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.189
 most kills on the champions 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.159
 has its own teams, so to speak 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.930
 Do it with it then really 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.949
 a bit more steam related 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.599
 virtually scanner scale very own hand 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.459
 Do not get me dipped in anything 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.340
 that will be six christa later on me 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.739
 can I play the video while 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.280
 the loud cry of the sacral later 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.409
 are at both blue caps and growing and 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.329
 while staying and leveling when you are 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:21.419
 a keypad that could go too 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.330
 accept brings you some gold and 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.949
 Skater 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.289
 in there or, more generally then pretty 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.490
 I'll be faster pretty much faster 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.159
 would be of a not insignificant 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.770
 improvements in spoken a text 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.990
 quite noticeable feeling on and 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.979
 Attack speed is still very important so 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.270
 and probably there in the area 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.639
 not necessarily hold if one 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.180
 has taken character and the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.120
 vision the damage at his half-time 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.069
 let this very large field freiherr because 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.520
 faster can do what chancellor in the web 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.879
 can and yes seems very exciting 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.530
 to be and kill kaiser then there 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.569
 you see, I think that very strongly 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.509
 He must necessarily give a village 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.159
 the murdered emperor is aware 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.590
 hurt the dragon big 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.150
 make a likelihood 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.389
 every time he deliberately harms the evening work 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.719
 a killer damn murdered kaiser 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.819
 his team is important to his team 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.400
 kill him then conjures murders 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.710
 a kite job that follows him and for 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.090
 fight him if I have always wondered 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.469
 like a clash of mountains 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.199
 and would go out longer 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:30.340
 now it could not happen 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.759
 more the kite dies and 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:38.020
 develops on it behind him 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:41.039
 what the fuck that looks fierce from him 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.039
 is really immense 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.680
 but get proper in between 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.450
 So the otto tags I do not know in the 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.290
 normal dragon will probably match too 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.910
 how long the quasi or how long he 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.980
 Of course it will not stay 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.530
 clearly 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.510
 and so now a lookout 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.310
 represent quasi on what has yet to come 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.480
 will have it with the wiener comment 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.680
 yes not checked if it is new now 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.140
 is it really necessary to play ? 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.330
 everything is not meant seriously 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.590
 only from release and here and here too 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.860
 Already the compliance of each never complete 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.800
 Based in the view field of play today 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.810
 on the in use come champions 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.640
 a different game feeling 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.950
 mediate and that will definitely do with it 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.610
 Achieves four classes or four 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.250
 champions so immense different 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.860
 differences and possibly could 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.600
 I imagine that has with this 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.210
 which is clear or with quite a few 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.390
 Updates to these four ranking 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.640
 champion then I may be so annoying 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.669
 it will be with you 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.200
 stop tank items a little devalued that has 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.890
 that will set you back out more 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.930
 Skills 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.570
 we have to play more aggressively for that 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.590
 unit less tennis that we up 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.030
 every case thinks you think 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.080
 yes I think so and what's up 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.750
 every case of the video 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.940
 I say thank you for seeing 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.680
 and will be back next time 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.660
 There are changes or when I come back 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.400
 note diamond error or something else 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.400
 next time
