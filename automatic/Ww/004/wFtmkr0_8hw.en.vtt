00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.380
 it's about "time de" 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.209
 Red Compain have the spirit 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.209
 in the coming up to a meeting place of St 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.860
 Today I brought a bottle with me 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.090
 exist beside it 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.869
 feelings 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.820
 szo and the Blackberry 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 Infiniti g Fact, I'm still using things 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.509
 the carnival fools black 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.509
 and gabbled Marc Nitzsche 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.010
 there is with the right therapy 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.600
 I do not like it either 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.370
 and I finally wish to find something 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.640
 and now, if I'm on everyone's lips 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.810
 such a few 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 typical way home as a boy 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 I was from Uwe Goerlich 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.740
 Mostly it is very pleasantly surprised 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.420
 even if the bottles are around 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.540
 b 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.409
 dpa 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.380
 they have this 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.050
 was opaque 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.550
 Ha 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.800
 and in this black will go 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.590
 See walls 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.270
 why definitely pointed out here 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.850
 then it was just the receipt of one of them and up here as well 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.899
 on it progressively in the political system now looks 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.899
 Brok looks modern and and and 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.429
 we also play Indian 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.640
 three points than now 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.149
 but to my knowledge there were only 3 king divorced the severance pay 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
 and the first time not been nice the second 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 with video 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.040
 and the third one is now one of them 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.190
 it means 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.980
 Polke was on 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.260
 Wine barrels access with used 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.670
 and the special thing about this bottle is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.590
 it was also Ikea 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.249
 7 there is one 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.280
 mixed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.400
 and he is confessed 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.200
 from the historical and always very young for the first 2000 with the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.050
 new owners 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.050
 One expressed also the purchase sale against 7 o'clock until against 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.549
 to let on the Brend before was completely stupid even in the criticism 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.059
 to hundreds of different ages 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.779
 Vintages taken from this Infiniti different Piegeler 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:22.559

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.559
 currently is 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.049
 one 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.539
 right between the first look similar 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.989
 as the mother of the child, she is still sad 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.879
 so 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.590
 from the paper form you have them so good 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.909
 a key phrase green freezes now so have to continue in there 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.269
 and filled with 5 7 percent alcohol 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.269
 Ha 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.209
 on the paper in front 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.279
 Grevens this destination in place 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.859
 that's one of the few that come here for the sake of it 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.499
 On the mountain 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 how so 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.779
 funny 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.870
 Ersü Reißner 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.059
 red-white gates 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.389
 if you look here 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.389
 are already celebrating many times 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.799
 and now, too 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.260
 the titles of each minor should be up to 20 ppm 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.319
 with her senses 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.889
 covered 10 15 means you take in numbers 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.639
 - Simons is one 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.809
 how this their Foster plays in whether there has been young smoky handed 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.229
 or if you are 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:58.679
 elder 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.549
 there wants barrels of stakeholders 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.689
 over goods 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.379
 introduced a fresh boatman festival 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.499
 I do not know 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.499
 Cribs issued out 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.319
 Torsten Wolf has 50 minutes per cent and usually fast in the mouth 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.439
 baldly 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.959
 with now 1 percent and now has exactly 50 spin-off the limit I have that 

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.590
 Water already set 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.680
 but come here since the alcohol test from Naas not so creamy to the nose stands out 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.529
 of course distance 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.529
 Aspen triumphs and dry 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.949
 in which also comes now 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.949
 Israel 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.949
 Melle 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.400
 as always 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.689
 She has 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.129
 but actually she loves me 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.960
 stated 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.960
 harmoniously 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.550
 to taste from 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.479
 now a group a 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.569
 pushes right through 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.069
 but 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.189
 to 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.469
 the duty of this officer 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.319
 Prock 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.550
 the Complex 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 by Thomas j 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.500
 the complexity of the many different flavors thats what it is 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.589
 makes up these goals and 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:50.910
 that can be sure 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.129
 Saving a little bit of water 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.580
 pity that the DIW 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.369
 third and last 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.589
 yes cooling off 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:00.770
 versions 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.430
 The tables mean it is possible 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.520
 But I'm pretty sure 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.819
 if it's nice region 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:08.720
 exemplary 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.770
 whoever is 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.199
 Farther 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.439
 she paints whiskys 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.250
 already closed 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.789
 in between such a bottle 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:16.869
 I really appreciate it 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.869
 to create as intact 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.009
