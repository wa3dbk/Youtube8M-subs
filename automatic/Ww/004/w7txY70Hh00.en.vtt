going to be one sound file so let's go
up<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.500> I've<00:02:04.829> made<00:02:05.100> four<00:02:05.399> slides<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:06.439> I'm

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
up here I've made four slides now I'm

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.410 
up here I've made four slides now I'm
now<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> go<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.470> slide<00:02:10.470> 1<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.420> this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
now going to go back to slide 1 and this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.480 
now going to go back to slide 1 and this
is<00:02:12.660> where<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:13.110> going

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
here to the task pane to where it says

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.370 
here to the task pane to where it says
slide<00:02:27.850> transition<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.090> then<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.080> want<00:02:30.260> to
