00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.099
 for years we had heard it over and over 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.800
 nine times out of ten dentists 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.180
 they advised a chewing gum without sugar our 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.099
 team had embarked on a 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.890
 investigation that seemed not to reach 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.420
 Nowhere is that absurd. It's about 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 of an urban legend in the 15th congress 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 of dentists did not talk about anything else 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 it's a hot topic 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:36.090
 I think there is good there are many theories 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.090
 but I personally do not know what's going 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.570
 in search of the tenth dentist after 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
 several false tracks 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 it would seem to approach the cinema 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 conclusion valid for our 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 southern investigation there had been several 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.890
 sightings of what could be 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.379
 our subject in a forest of the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 apalaches for several days we toured 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.260
 the forests in search of this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.260
 great spirit 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.260
 do not be harris 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.780
 already if we imagined it 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.810
 ah 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.039
 without sugar we have 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.170
 After a hard morning we stopped at 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.780
 the way to mount the base camp 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.840
 around the perimeter of the base with 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.150
 tension macintosh detectors 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.690
 it was time to take a nap and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.060
 regain strength with a water broth 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.060
 repairman we love doing 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.020
 one of the alarms had jumped without 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 just time to get rid of the deception 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 we stumble forward in search of 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 this set 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.280
 but although the tests were there how 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 convince skeptics always 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.270
 there could be a doubt if it is not 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.430
 would try a fawn fight or a 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.330
 opossum would have studied 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.010
 medicine 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 we have to analyze 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.769
 conscientiously the images with a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.000
 powerful and sophisticated system on 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.860
 unfortunately we found a serial 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.079
 valid and the evaluation version removed 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.209
 in a red cross we try with the 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.430
 microsoft in there and after several days of 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.650
 paint the image mustache with the pot of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.409
 spray we realized that this one did not 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.360
 was a friend's software left us a 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.640
 test version of another system with the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.329
 that we could achieve these enlightening 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.329
 results 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.609
 we have found the tenth dentist
