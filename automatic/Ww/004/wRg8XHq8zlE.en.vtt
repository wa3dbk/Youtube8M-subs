here now sometimes you'll run into a lot

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.070 
here now sometimes you'll run into a lot
of<00:05:14.170> issues<00:05:14.500> getting<00:05:15.100> web<00:05:15.370> servers<00:05:15.790> started<00:05:16.270> it

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
of issues getting web servers started it

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.260 
of issues getting web servers started it
does<00:05:17.380> run<00:05:17.620> on<00:05:17.650> port<00:05:18.010> 80<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.850> things<00:05:19.120> you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
does run on port 80 so the things you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.740 
does run on port 80 so the things you
can<00:05:19.450> do<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:20.200> fix<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:22.000> could<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.420> lot<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
can do to fix that you could a lot of

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.870 
can do to fix that you could a lot of
times<00:05:22.960> Skype<00:05:23.470> is<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.920> conflicting<00:05:24.490> program

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
times Skype is the conflicting program

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.090 
times Skype is the conflicting program
because<00:05:25.090> Skype<00:05:25.360> also<00:05:25.600> runs<00:05:25.960> on<00:05:26.080> port<00:05:26.410> 80<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.010> if

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
because Skype also runs on port 80 so if

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.130 
because Skype also runs on port 80 so if
you<00:05:27.190> have<00:05:27.370> Skype<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.450> go<00:05:28.660> through<00:05:28.930> and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
you have Skype you can go through and
