00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.699
 camera camera slow motion 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.350
 I am light of the photos and for those who 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.299
 recently joined the program when 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.310
 we talk about photography they answer their 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.470
 questions and we talk about the things that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.540
 we all like the sun finally came out 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.840
 of the spring, Buenos Aires, and 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.100
 truth is that today is a beautiful day and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.250
 answer a question that I liked 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.800
 a lot that you did solve and she 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.510
 ask if I could show you some of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.550
 the internet sources from where I 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.769
 I learn things or where there are good videos 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.140
 to learn it's true that it's good 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.070
 study photography but where I more 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.530
 I learn things 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.239
 because the resources are infinite the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.630
 pages that I like the most for 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.129
 start I really like to know that more than 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.650
 nothing I do not know if it has a website of the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.079
 photographer but it is a YouTube channel in 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.170
 which make very educational videos 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.780
 where they explain everything I pass by to serve 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.780
 of Equipements 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.210
 of light and everything is very explained are 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.580
 doubles of good ideas is not your 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.080
 great photographer the instructor but he is very 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 good educator 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 then I really like what is the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.690
 study that this photographer has 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.210
 American is called ernest and not only 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.490
 have a page where you have articles 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.060
 written on a YouTube channel in the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.040
 which every day publishes a video in 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.140
 which are taught to do something in 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 photoshop if you are interested in learning things 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.580
 from the challenge that is pretty good 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.950
 because this is a very high level and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.290
 It explains very well also this tutorial 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.850
 of cecil for your page and perform 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.160
 they have tutorial and cereals are 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.680
 very good I have one and the truth that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.140
 They are two - hour tutorials explains everything 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
 from scratch as he did the pictures 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.000
 so it was very good after good 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.729
 because it's amazing that this is what 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 a community of photographers have a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.240
 youtube channel have a page where 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.970
 many articles have many 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.520
 photographers collaborators of all 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.800
 scopes from fashion to photography 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.660
 journalistic to product photo me 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.630
 it seems is a great resource because 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:20.680
 time for everyone 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:26.470
 now more tender of which all the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.620
 likes and also have videos 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.620
 educational 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.980
 makes videos regularly with them where 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.990
 you have to explain and gloss as highlighted 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.200
 in your photos and there are also others 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.600
 collaborators super photographers who 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 they explain a bit of everything 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 another resource that is a page where 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.030
 they test lenses and layers but they are hard 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.760
 those very rigorous tests and I want them 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.800
 a scoring system that is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.630
 important that those who are looking for 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.630
 to take 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.580
 10 acy chromatic distortion 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.959
 then very low levels want 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.160
 tell him he's a kind of paralysis another 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.160
 more like old 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.900
 but it has some clay gems 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.060
 on the occasion of the days and explains very 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.060
 well you have to of these writings and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.230

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.019

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.790
