00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello michael clouds today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.029
 I will show you how to build a lower world reactor 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:21.859
 walk like that 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:36.469
 for the construction of the reactor you mention the core 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:43.079
 reactor four gold cubes 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:46.730
 well, so the cobblestone begin to build 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.730
 so cool 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.090
 so here we take 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:21.550
 warn you when we will build from 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:24.880
 reactor necessarily take a sword 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:34.149
 but better not camille 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:53.060
 because it would be like a pigs so 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:57.009
 on the sides and death close the artist here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.009
 he is ready to go on 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.009
 turn on 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 so my complexity is peaceful 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.470
 I will not have these pigs 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.470
 appear 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.240
 so here are a few things killed around 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.360
 it's all in pan troit 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.360
 Piven's skrug there's a lot of things 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.730
 so and this is all as you see here it is 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.019
 the wall starts to fade a little 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.150
 but all to the end drawing here I hope you 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.579
 know that when you break a pick it 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.439
 runs into him him set fire to her 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:39.739
 and it burns forever 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:41.920
 you coin these door pictures are gold 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.000
 swinezombi screams 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:51.560
 so like I hope all of you understand but 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.680
 than this apse is clever 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.519
 all covered apse when if 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.980
 dig it in the middle will remain your 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:06.859
 core reactor and you can use 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.139
 take advantage again so golden cubes 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:13.910
 he will have to mine 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:20.090
 again but pretty much so well 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 okay, children understood how to do it and mine 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.400
 by the way more tips 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.669
 if you want to play on the computer 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.840
 mantra on the net and see only what is possible 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:36.370
 play through hamachi never say 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.440
 to you about what my advice to you because I myself 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.780
 but I checked it myself because 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.470
 that when you connect to another 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:51.020
 computer on that computer may be 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:54.500
 viruses you can bring it to yourself it 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.659
 of course at any time can happen 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.479
 so better not risk your 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.380
 computer does not download and hamachi is better 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.880
 buy immediately 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:08.780
 licensed so it will be much easier 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.900
 play don't forget it was hella 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.900
 black 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.870
 subscribe to the channel put likes and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.870
