hello<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:07.799> name<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.040> LOM<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:09.110> finally<00:00:10.110> got

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
hello my name is LOM and I finally got

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.799 
hello my name is LOM and I finally got
to<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.490> go<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.210> trying<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:13.730> annoying

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
to have a go at trying to be annoying

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
to have a go at trying to be annoying
intercepting<00:00:15.809> stealth<00:00:16.740> jets<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> game

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
intercepting stealth jets in the game

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
intercepting stealth jets in the game
with<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> air<00:00:18.690> active<00:00:19.140> radar<00:00:19.439> missiles<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> my

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
with the air active radar missiles so my

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.929 
with the air active radar missiles so my
tactic<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.810> game<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.980> simple

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
tactic for this game was to do simple

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509 
tactic for this game was to do simple
hidden<00:00:24.510> runs<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.990> skirt<00:00:25.680> around<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> edges

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
hidden runs just skirt around the edges

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.779 
hidden runs just skirt around the edges
of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> map<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.960> air<00:00:28.349> targets<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.160> then

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the map look for air targets and then

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580 
of the map look for air targets and then
swoop<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.750> some<00:00:30.929> work<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.260> them

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
swoop in and do some work on them

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.310 
swoop in and do some work on them
I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> stealth<00:00:32.969> fighter<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.510> kind<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I think the stealth fighter is kind of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.799 
I think the stealth fighter is kind of
underestimated<00:00:34.890> since<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
underestimated since like here the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
underestimated since like here the
attack<00:00:37.079> jet<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.620> breaks<00:00:37.890> off<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> doesn't

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
attack jet just breaks off and doesn't

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.569 
attack jet just breaks off and doesn't
even<00:00:38.700> bother<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> help<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> wood

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
even bother to help out with the wood

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.510 
even bother to help out with the wood
finishing<00:00:42.000> me<00:00:42.120> off<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:43.219> I'm<00:00:44.219> allowed<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
finishing me off so I'm allowed to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
finishing me off so I'm allowed to
dogfight<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.690> less<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.079> own

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
dogfight this one more less on my own

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
dogfight this one more less on my own
and<00:00:46.440> he<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.190> switched<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> another

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and he also just switched to another

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.400 
and he also just switched to another
target<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.070> then<00:00:50.070> ends<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.399> him<00:00:50.640> dying

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
target which then ends with him dying

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
target which then ends with him dying
now<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.559> you're<00:00:52.680> flying<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> stealth<00:00:54.030> jet<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now when you're flying the stealth jet I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
now when you're flying the stealth jet I
would<00:00:54.750> recommend<00:00:55.739> prioritizing<00:00:56.520> your

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
would recommend prioritizing your

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
would recommend prioritizing your
targets<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> planes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
targets so you should go for the planes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.389 
targets so you should go for the planes
first<00:00:59.760> preferably<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:01.140> rid<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> attack

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
first preferably get rid of the attack

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.910 
first preferably get rid of the attack
jet<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> stealth<00:01:03.840> jet<00:01:03.930> after<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
jet and then the stealth jet after that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.230 
jet and then the stealth jet after that
do<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> combat<00:01:05.580> chopper<00:01:07.159> second<00:01:08.159> Scouts<00:01:08.850> then

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
do the combat chopper second Scouts then

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.530 
do the combat chopper second Scouts then
transport<00:01:10.010> when<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.970> any<00:01:12.150> air<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
transport when you don't have any air to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.740 
transport when you don't have any air to
fight<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.470> whatever<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.830> fight

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
for when they will respawn with that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
of the enemy airplanes if I see an

of the enemy airplanes if I see an
attack<00:01:27.240> chopper<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.500> scout

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
attack chopper and then to scout

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.319 
attack chopper and then to scout
somewhere<00:01:29.130> else<00:01:29.250> fighting<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.090> each<00:01:30.119> other

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
somewhere else fighting with each other

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.719 
somewhere else fighting with each other
I<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.600> help<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.290> Scout<00:01:31.590> first<00:01:31.829> before

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I would help out our Scout first before

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
I would help out our Scout first before
going<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> attack<00:01:33.810> chopper<00:01:34.140> because

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going for the attack chopper because

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
going for the attack chopper because
it's<00:01:35.610> better<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> help<00:01:36.180> them<00:01:36.450> survive<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's better to help them survive and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's better to help them survive and
then<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.829> able<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.159> assist<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.610> later<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.750> than

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
then be able to assist you later on than

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.910 
then be able to assist you later on than
just<00:01:40.490> blinking<00:01:41.490> away<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.090> other

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
just blinking away at some other

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.069 
just blinking away at some other
helicopters<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> hopefully<00:01:44.520> killing<00:01:44.880> them

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.630 

now<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> don't<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> upgrades

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now if you don't have all the upgrades

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
now if you don't have all the upgrades
for<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> stealth<00:01:51.090> jets<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> good<00:01:52.560> time

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
for the stealth jets this is a good time

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.069 
for the stealth jets this is a good time
to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:53.729> flying<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.570> since<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to be flying with them since it's a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.690 
to be flying with them since it's a
double<00:01:55.380> xp<00:01:55.649> week<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.899> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.200> add<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
double xp week and if you add the a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.359 
double xp week and if you add the a
bonus<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.810> addition<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:02.070> least<00:02:02.219> in

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
bonus in addition I think at least in

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
bonus in addition I think at least in
some<00:02:02.549> games<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> seems<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.810> hundred

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
some games it seems like the hundred

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
some games it seems like the hundred
percent<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.460> added<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> base<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
percent you get is added to the base and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.109 
percent you get is added to the base and
then<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.799> percentage<00:02:07.799> again<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.640> top<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
then the percentage again on top of that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
then the percentage again on top of that
it's<00:02:09.330> added<00:02:09.599> again<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.410> 50%

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's added again so if you have a 50%
