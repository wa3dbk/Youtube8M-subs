00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the source of the smell is because for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 
the source of the smell is because for
gas<00:01:13.110> leaks<00:01:13.380> um<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:14.400> um<00:01:14.549> purposely<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gas leaks um they um purposely have a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
gas leaks um they um purposely have a
rotten<00:01:16.590> egg<00:01:16.799> smell<00:01:16.830> added<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> because

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
rotten egg smell added to it because

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.039 
rotten egg smell added to it because
it's<00:01:18.810> an<00:01:18.869> overnight<00:01:19.520> yeah<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.780> why<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it's an overnight yeah so that's why I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's an overnight yeah so that's why I
smelled<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.680> bar<00:01:26.450> I'll<00:01:27.450> smell<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> all

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
smelled like a bar I'll smell that all

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
smelled like a bar I'll smell that all
the<00:01:28.710> more<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.670> its<00:01:29.790> parts<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.630> know

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the more than for its parts you know

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.499 
the more than for its parts you know
what<00:01:31.130> my<00:01:32.130> fort<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.490> been<00:01:32.670> smelling<00:01:33.090> recently

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
what my fort has been smelling recently

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
what my fort has been smelling recently
and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:33.950> it's<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:35.189> protein

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and I think it's been protein

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270 
and I think it's been protein
I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.540> pro<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.930> found<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.619> culprit<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I think it's pro I found a culprit the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
I think it's pro I found a culprit the
high<00:01:38.400> consumption<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.090> protein<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> well

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
high consumption of protein it is well

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
high consumption of protein it is well
it's<00:01:40.380> specifically<00:01:41.100> whey<00:01:41.490> protein<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's specifically whey protein and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's specifically whey protein and
protein<00:01:42.479> bars<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.500> what

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
protein bars and stuff like that what

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
protein bars and stuff like that what
they<00:01:43.770> call<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.040> protein<00:01:44.369> part<00:01:44.579> even<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
they call them protein part even when I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
they call them protein part even when I
stop<00:01:45.630> though<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> have

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
stop though it's like this but you have

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
stop though it's like this but you have
it<00:01:47.399> infused<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.149> body<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it infused in your body you need a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
it infused in your body you need a
colonic<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.430> holy<00:01:50.610> water<00:01:50.729> day<00:01:51.149> that's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
colonic and some holy water day that's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
colonic and some holy water day that's
because<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> clean<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:52.979> your

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
because you just need to clean out your

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.139 
because you just need to clean out your
system<00:01:53.399> once<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.820> you'll<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.090> fine<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.200> on

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
system once and you'll be fine but go on

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.490 
system once and you'll be fine but go on
instead<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.240> protein<00:01:57.630> farts<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.350> there<00:02:01.350> were

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
instead of protein farts so there were

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130
