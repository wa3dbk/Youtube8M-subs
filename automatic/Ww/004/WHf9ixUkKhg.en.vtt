00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.690
 strategic and research and 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.360
 destruction in the trailer is displayed 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.280
 more than seven game modes so we 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.440
 imagine even more who may go 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.840
 be announced later and it's the same 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.759
 thing for the masts with regards to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.970
 maps precisely who you are confirmed 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.950
 will have a combined ted and evac are 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.899
 for now the only three maps of which 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940
 we could distinguish bmp so too 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.500
 for now the only three map of the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.030
 beta for new specialists 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.069
 specialists have added to it 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.810
 name the spectrum and the battery for 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.819
 tears of the specialist beat it is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.250
 of a kind of war machine that 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.900
 shoot my grenades for the ability 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.280
 it's a kinect armor so basically 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.019
 when someone shoot us 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.599
 bullets are reduced to steam by 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 smoked so be careful do not say 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.940
 again in the comments this is 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.909
 leave etc 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 we do not know how it will be better 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.890
 do not judge before trying to 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.139
 tears of the spectrum that unfolds blades 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.719
 cutting which thus crushes the enemies 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.549
 and the capacity is an active hood that 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.989
 makes him invisible like a chameleon so 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.480
 if you are next to a snake have 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.030
 not this example if you are next 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.249
 of a plant you take the color of a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.379
 plant quan for a few moments to 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.420
 those who wish it here is the list 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.900
 full of specialists have who has the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.810
 ruined 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.389
 the awt writer takes advantage the battery the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.670
 serraf and the nomad and to finish the 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.260
 reaper and spectrum 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.359
 but watch out very important all the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.269
 things unlock in the beta will only be 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.230
 that unlocked for the beta and not the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.480
 following the game for example 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.189
 he armed specialists and so that's 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.980
 for info treyarch said that the beta 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.779
 would do 15 gig for ps4 now he 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.489
 remains to be seen if these 15 for all 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.249
 platforms but I think that's okay 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.499
 also do about 15 for pc and the 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:33.139
 xbox one and there are still a lot of 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.269
 world who asked why my code 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.489
 beta is not valid on the site 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.379
 when I put it to you it seems to me 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.810
 we can not put the code yet 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.819
 but it will only be valid the day before 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.799
 or the day of the release, here you are 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.950
 put and you will receive the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.209

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.219
 pacific time 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.469
 so I did some research so if 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.760

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.669

 of the morning on August 19th , so French time 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.510
 European values ​​simply 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.579
