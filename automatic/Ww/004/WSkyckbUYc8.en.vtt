two<00:00:00.480> years<00:00:00.750> ago<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.199> week<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.709> learned<00:00:01.920> that

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
two years ago this week we learned that

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.340 
two years ago this week we learned that
the<00:00:02.310> conductor<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.300> Santiago<00:00:03.959> Spain

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
the conductor of the Santiago Spain

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.829 
the conductor of the Santiago Spain
train<00:00:04.920> crash<00:00:05.339> was<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.000> phone<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.540> time

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
train crash was on the phone at the time

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.720 
train crash was on the phone at the time
of<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.140> accident<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:08.130> was<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> crash<00:00:08.700> that

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
of the accident this was a crash that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.589 
of the accident this was a crash that
occurred<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.630> july<00:00:09.929> 24th<00:00:10.620> 2013<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.120> train<00:00:12.420> was

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
occurred on july 24th 2013 the train was

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.230 
occurred on july 24th 2013 the train was
going<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.200> twice<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.679> posted<00:00:14.460> speed<00:00:14.670> limit

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
going at twice the posted speed limit

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.300 
going at twice the posted speed limit
when<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.780> hit<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> curve<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> went<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
when it hit a curve and went off the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
when it hit a curve and went off the
rails<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.760> hundred<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.240> forty<00:00:18.539> people<00:00:18.690> were

rails a hundred and forty people were

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.529 
rails a hundred and forty people were
injured<00:00:19.260> 79<00:00:19.859> people<00:00:20.070> died<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:21.330> the

injured 79 people died with the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
injured 79 people died with the
breakthroughs<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> made<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
breakthroughs that we have made in the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.910 
breakthroughs that we have made in the
world<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.000> autonomous<00:00:24.600> automobiles<00:00:25.260> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
world of autonomous automobiles you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
world of autonomous automobiles you
would<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:26.849> now<00:00:27.119> autonomous

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
would think that by now autonomous

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.890 
would think that by now autonomous
trains<00:00:28.410> would<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.859> relatively<00:00:29.369> widespread

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
trains would be relatively widespread

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
trains would be relatively widespread
many<00:00:30.900> places<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:32.009> train<00:00:32.489> control

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
many places do have train control

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
many places do have train control
technology<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.870> we've<00:00:34.230> talked<00:00:34.530> Louis

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
technology like this we've talked Louis

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.860 
technology like this we've talked Louis
to<00:00:34.950> our<00:00:35.100> trained<00:00:35.760> engineer<00:00:36.000> friend<00:00:36.570> about

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
to our trained engineer friend about

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
to our trained engineer friend about
this<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.070> different

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
this we know that there are different

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
this we know that there are different
train<00:00:39.149> systems<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.320> world<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
train systems around the world that have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.690 
train systems around the world that have
these<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:42.180> sort<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> overarching<00:00:43.700> automated

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
these of sort of overarching automated

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.819 
these of sort of overarching automated
controls<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.390> trains<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.230> everybody<00:00:46.680> has

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
controls of trains but not everybody has

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.930 
controls of trains but not everybody has
instituted<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.640> yet<00:00:48.020> yes<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.489> seems

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
instituted these yet yes and it it seems

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.049 
instituted these yet yes and it it seems
much<00:00:51.840> easier<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.649> than<00:00:53.100> having<00:00:53.550> highways

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
much easier to do than having highways

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.709 
much easier to do than having highways
full<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> autonomous<00:00:55.110> automobiles<00:00:56.719> we've

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
full of autonomous automobiles we've

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.209 
full of autonomous automobiles we've
said<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.109> need<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.620> train

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
said that we need more train

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
said that we need more train
transportation<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.180> country<00:01:00.600> we've

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
transportation in this country we've

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.709 
transportation in this country we've
also<00:01:00.899> talked<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:02.579> course<00:01:02.879> earlier<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
also talked about of course earlier in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
also talked about of course earlier in
the<00:01:03.780> week<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> French<00:01:04.589> trained<00:01:04.890> attack<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the week the French trained attack I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
the week the French trained attack I
discussed<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> bonus<00:01:06.150> show<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.659> lack<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
discussed on the bonus show the lack of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
discussed on the bonus show the lack of
security<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> trains<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> things<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
security on trains and things like that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.230 
security on trains and things like that
uh<00:01:09.650> there<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> problems<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
uh there are a lot of problems but I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
uh there are a lot of problems but I
mean<00:01:12.990> wouldn't<00:01:13.260> autonomous<00:01:13.920> train<00:01:14.189> solve

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
mean wouldn't autonomous train solve

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
mean wouldn't autonomous train solve
problems<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.509> happening<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
problems like this from happening I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
problems like this from happening I
think<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> answer<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.770> clear<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.790> some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
think the answer is clear there are some

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
think the answer is clear there are some
airports<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.350> essentially<00:01:19.950> have

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
airports that essentially have

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
airports that essentially have
autonomous<00:01:20.640> trains<00:01:20.970> already<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> when

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
autonomous trains already when and when

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
autonomous trains already when and when
we<00:01:22.259> reserve<00:01:22.770> talking<00:01:23.040> about<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.369> layers<00:01:23.580> one

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
we reserve talking about two layers one

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
we reserve talking about two layers one
is<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.750> engineer<00:01:25.229> running<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
is you have an engineer running the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
is you have an engineer running the
train<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.060> overarching

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
train but there is an overarching

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
train but there is an overarching
control<00:01:28.200> which<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:29.040> allow<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> train

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
control which will not allow the train

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
control which will not allow the train
to<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.850> faster<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> posted<00:01:31.110> speed

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to go faster than the posted speed

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
to go faster than the posted speed
period<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.970> we're<00:01:33.119> talking<00:01:33.420> about<00:01:33.509> fully

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
period then we're talking about fully

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
period then we're talking about fully
autonomous<00:01:34.470> trains<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> think

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
autonomous trains and I I think

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.749 
autonomous trains and I I think
orlando's<00:01:36.270> airport<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.020> example<00:01:37.530> i<00:01:37.759> believe

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
orlando's airport for example i believe

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.380 
orlando's airport for example i believe
uh<00:01:40.130> Washington<00:01:41.130> Dulles<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.150> lots

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
uh Washington Dulles and there are lots

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
uh Washington Dulles and there are lots
of<00:01:42.540> airports<00:01:42.960> internationally<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.159> go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
of airports internationally where to go

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
of airports internationally where to go
from<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.700> terminal<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> another<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.350> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
from one terminal to another you get on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
from one terminal to another you get on
a<00:01:46.470> train<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.280> nobody<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
a train that has nobody on it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
a train that has nobody on it
controlling<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> train<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.130> whether<00:01:50.340> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
controlling the train now whether it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.160 
controlling the train now whether it's
fully<00:01:50.820> autonomous<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> an

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
fully autonomous or you have an

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
fully autonomous or you have an
individual<00:01:52.710> remotely<00:01:53.159> controlling<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
individual remotely controlling the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
individual remotely controlling the
train<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.329> actually<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.229> but

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
train that I actually don't know but

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
train that I actually don't know but
clearly<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.430> technology<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.600> than

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
clearly this technology is more than

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.649 
clearly this technology is more than
feasible<00:01:58.369> yes<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> course<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> when<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.509> we

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
feasible yes of course and when when we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.440 
feasible yes of course and when when we
say<00:02:00.869> fully<00:02:01.229> autonomous<00:02:01.950> maybe<00:02:02.850> we're<00:02:03.119> talking

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
say fully autonomous maybe we're talking

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
say fully autonomous maybe we're talking
about<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.020> something<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
about here not just something that is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
about here not just something that is
controlled<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> computer<00:02:05.689> but<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.899> train

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
controlled by a computer but a train

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
controlled by a computer but a train
that<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.530> recognize<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.610> something<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> on

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that will recognize when something is on

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.150 
that will recognize when something is on
the<00:02:09.330> track<00:02:09.569> ahead<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.500> adapt<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the track ahead of it and can adapt and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.920 
the track ahead of it and can adapt and
change

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
change

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.569 
change
and<00:02:12.049> do<00:02:12.709> different<00:02:12.859> things<00:02:13.040> based<00:02:13.430> on

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
and do different things based on

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.140 
and do different things based on
whatever<00:02:14.239> situation<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:14.989> in
