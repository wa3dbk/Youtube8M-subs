00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.200
 but again today with the kettcar 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.300
 and imagine this is more than 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 the classic exercise yes no with that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 You can actually drive things 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 So we have two moving ones here 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.160
 then the independent plates the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.670
 It would have to balance out here with yours 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.830
 feet 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.019
 There is a relatively small one here 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 hard rubber tires this one already 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.730
 makes it a little hard when you do something 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.260
 uneven terrain is on the way it has 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.630
 already suffered a bit so now 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.340
 We are now just was so moved 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.110
 So we are turned on and we are 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 the classic a cyclist and have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.809
 set us up and be one me 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.850
 Cope with it relatively quickly 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 but the whole problem 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 transfiguring becomes clear if you like 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.780
 about already a quite a while 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340
 rad yes when i test chinese all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 possible einrÃ¤dern I 've done it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 I do not want to be caught in my mouth yet 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 I had it that the device via in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 other video has dropped and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.920
 I can run it out 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 I did not manage that here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 because I'm too far in the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 laid back and then the device has 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 Simply put, I drive under me now 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 away and yes I'm up nicely then 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.920
 hogged pig 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 that there was no katar behind me and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 the first time 10 meters and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 whereas car should be thundered against so 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 You may also see it because of us 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.759
 already tested 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 it has become equal several times 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.430
 overturn yes and of course 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.590
 any injuries and pulled 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.610
 I have to go through these little tires 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.350
 in person we say through now 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.159
 Concentrate that he is the same pressure 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.920
 Exercises with both feet so that the device 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.770
 worth it at all 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 if one side is too soft and one side 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.360
 to then captain all over cake or 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.460
 otherwise the same then would have 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 really get used to it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.689
 with two equal pressure to exert 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 to go straight if a little 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.200
 stony or includes comes 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.939
 then that makes it so impression that you 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 whole balance from foreign trade 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.320
 travel and so for me I have to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.939
 honestly tell me how peace would be 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.140
 for me it would be pure from the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.340
 agility and unity he asks 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.480
 So it must say that turns on 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.010
 not just like that one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.450
 and the thing is that of one too 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.430
 Cyclist will be natural with the wheel 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.020
 an axis it is easy when you are in 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.489
 the movement up to here is soya two 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.840
 Axes or legs would have to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.730
 different synchronize that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.019
 brain also has to measure the program and there 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.580
 do you have that's just the time on it 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.069
 actually not so bad is one 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.310
 funny gimmick what you look at each 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.380
 Buy case should be opposite to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.230
 the classic 1 watt so therefore 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.569
 Mexico's infections are out 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 but some yes and hamburg court ok 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.170
 labs kilo is not extremely difficult 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.760
 he I want them when I can unicycle 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.470
 rich really take it in hand 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.150
 handy days yes see his like you 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 already said your trade is 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.330
 of course I'd say what gives with 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.950
 Cattle keeping bigger cases with one 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.989
 ready and was against the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 Recognition areas in berlin where 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.859
 The street has almost everything here 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.230
 to which music stones and other 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.329
 so it is truly smooth 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.320
 I would say asphalt but one 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.090
 Weighing because here in the iss 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.440
 Smooth roads are definitely one 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.209
 highlight with the parts of the country try 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.769
 take the terrain is and so on 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 bit holstein rather let the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.720
 finger off because the driver as well as the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:27.019
 new package big yes but otherwise cool 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.019
 I think I'm bad and tried 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.290
 the chancellors prevent 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.579
 maybe the scratches from you 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.549
 we can prevent it by simply 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.400
 one to our dad I very very horny 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:43.260
 yes that is ask from 42 meters 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.349
 Can you just do classic gives 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.569
 driver to and then you typed you the 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.890
 so go here if to cut and 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.239
 then he could scratch in the future 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.549
 Of course, first of the main's in 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.079
 different colors in black high in 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.310
 green and could be up to date with our 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.510
 order online shop or come by 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.799
 from 12 90 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.109
 that should still be worth the part 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.459
 where the sharing will have met 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.049
 Fan shop is but I think there must 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.150
 First of all we sit down together 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.680
 our customer here we are 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.629
 just really primarily focused on 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.519
 here will not be high quality mobility 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.750
 present 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.160
 that is not so easy for me yet 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.470
 not so much as carrying capacities 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.550
 size limit the principle with it back 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.780
 to set but every time so one 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.300
 small area were from the beginning 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 but you need tempelhofer feld 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.050
 I think what else can do 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.490
 if not in our portfolio 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.970
 one also later with valentin newspaper 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.650
 bigger tires and then certainly would 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.509
 an alternative look individual 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.160
 Inserts on me so important that 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.050
 device can use individually if 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.910
 I just really smooth out now 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.360
 can drive without internet without 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.320
 good thinking without soil is for me 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.270
 so personally when i am in the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.830
 customer service is not necessarily that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.479
 Optimal I try with the others 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.590
 areas and we would come 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.539
 would ride a little more 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.610
 test object just put down and 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.830
 let the customers reflect for example 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.340
 keep it and if you are positive 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.870
 recognize 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.870
 also say why not
