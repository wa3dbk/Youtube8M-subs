 64 bit in this video simply 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.610
 we will download the 32 bit version and 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.869
 we will assign 1 gb of ram for its correct 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.850
 functioning 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.369
 first of all you have to go to the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.789
 java girl download page 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.789
 dot com 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.690
 then we put in we are going to download

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 in a moment that they are downloaded 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.730
 download you have to execute it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.550
 welcome dental jonathan to install 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.750
 ready 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.750
 for a flame to be installed 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:20.190
 well this is probably already 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.190
 will leave if you get to give next 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 we have finished 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.160
 who linked time 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.120
 once we finish this 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.680
 we have to go to our team to my pc 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.040
 or my team depends on your windows 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.480
 Y 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
 let's go to local disk 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.750
 we go to program files 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.750
 for 86 we go to the call section 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.580
 j r 7 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.590
 link 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.590
 and here we buy the address 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.880
 of location calls them 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.640
 let's go again we go to our point of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.000
 income now 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 open lies 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.830
 the launcher 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.830
 Let start 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.860
 doing tests 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 and such a profile 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.620
 and here what we should replace is this 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.960
 piece of here and we put our 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 Location 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.060
 and it should be like that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.950
 against bars java w 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.400
 point excel 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.640
 and ready in arguments you must put 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.880
 the positive dike of the executable 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.620
 as well 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.730
 and where in arguments I'm going to copy 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.190
 all this and that is what you have to put 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.520
 especially your computer if you go to 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 play with a gb of ram that is that 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.900
 your computer has at least 2 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.900
 gigabytes we should leave you 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.319
 we must leave ram memory available 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.319
 to the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.060
 the operating system 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.000
 here 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.630
 you click right here on my computer 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.430
 in this team in a day 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.680
 and here you appear to the amount of ram 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.909
 must be greater than 2 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.909
 is what I recommend 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.580
 and having finished this once 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.580
 we can play a principle 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.390
 it's worth they open 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.540
 let's keep watching the blog to see what 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 such 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.990
 is in development 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.240
 from now on the video is only for 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.039
 the extra information that I wanted to give you 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.900
 but if all I wanted was 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.979
 solve the problem of chabÃ¡n until 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.240
 here everything is fine, here everything was going 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.590
 included 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.290
 works 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.570
 from now on and the video is just 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.260
 to inform your customers 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.510
 here you can change 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.810
 the ip of the server I recommend putting 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.640
 this to see when it's online offline 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.720
 if you are going to enter here you can see 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.440
 directly that the server is 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.190
 offline better here for ass and you 're 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.710
 Well, it's already a municipality 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.070
 up here all thanks so much for watching 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.070
 the video
