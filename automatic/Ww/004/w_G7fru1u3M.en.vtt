00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.690
 fernando albericio, former director of the 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.099
 yale university of the urcuquí canton 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.780
 expresses that his departure was given by 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 of the managing commission that integrated it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.509
 he along with three other professors they 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 they had the power to stop me and they have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 ceased has been legal I believe that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 ethically and again it is not correct 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 but it has been legal among the reasons 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 says albericio have been the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.850
 divergences divergences between 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 three members of the management commission that 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.780
 they live in california and I at four 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 we have the same rights the same 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
 possibilities those four we charge the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 same salary a very generous salary 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
 on the part of the Ecuadorian people very 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 generous all well in california the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 things in california are very different 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 things in a cuc and on the other hand 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.300
 declares that of the four of the commission 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.220
 he was the only one who stayed in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 yale university while the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.390
 others live in california and when 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.489
 come here with anv and penthouses plus 700 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 dollars for mathematics apart from salary 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.770
 apart you say apart 16 thousand 300 dollars 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.719
 a month when they come here they play if it's 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.719
 one hundred thousand 700 dollars of travel expenses 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.480
 good because they demand the per diem even 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 Professor Andrew turned to another day 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.800
 an incongruity said that they lived quito 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 although it removed because collectibility already 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.450
 Ticos survive quite and still Ticos are 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.670
 the things that I have already denounced and are 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.220
 when I had not if these things create a 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.440
 Kick also expressed that he sought to avoid 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.930
 unnecessary or expensive expenses we are 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.300
 hiring people with very high salaries 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.400
 high 13 14 15 thousand dollars 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.710
 about decree 247 that has 100 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.630
 publications have no implications I 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.250
 raised this kind of problem who 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 makes a change of curricular Maya that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.340
 I think it 's wrong that it can serve 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 very good for the north it can be 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 perfectly for us but ecuador us 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.600
 USA among its proposals was the one of 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.830
 foster an educational model 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.420
 Latin American for the world a project 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.880
 enclave and native america of america 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 towards the world but not the world towards 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.539
 iberoamerica I believe that the america 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.030
 We try to copy and it's no use to copy 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.350
 and this one my idea was to work with other 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.840
 universities everyday work with 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.740
 universities of the Andean area 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.880
 work with universities 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.470
 Latin American and Chinese 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.470
 especially us 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.820
 I feel solid to expand clarifies 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 also that many of the publications 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.550
 present on the web of saints are from your 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.760
 authorship in the web of science that is the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.890
 26 better index of publications 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.460
 publications indexed with the name of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.790
 judge there are 19 already in my name 19 and me 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.350
 name x 7 approximately 75 80% 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 I can not say anything else in my name 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.830
 and according to the academic level they have 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.560
 each member of the management commission 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.570
 they had to keep publications 0 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 publications Mr. Rózsa x 0 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.420
 publications that real chance or 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.220
 I andrade publications 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.900
 you specify that your statements have the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.550
 due to sustenance and travel expenses are being 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.630
 paid for sure that your accounts 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.380
 current are the income the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.570
 viatical no one I did not say I am 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.100
 if there are irregularities and there are many 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.780
 irregularities this yes that there 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.560
 realities as soon as I do not have any 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.330
 afraid that they will take the case to me 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.610
 courts and defend and if I have to 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.200
 pay today's pay finally adds that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.750
 the threat does not lead to creating solutions 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.970
 or academic alternatives for the good of the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.980
 Students at Yale University not 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.629
 I think the threat is 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 to the way academics have 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.569
 threatened and have said that I'm short-sighted by 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.909
 that exempted pe because I'm short-sighted because I do not 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.190
 I want to spend I have supported it 75% of 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.810
 students by firms other students 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 They are also by my side but they have been able to 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.629
 sign the back logistics and other non 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.670
 they have signed because they do not know me but 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.470
 I have support is 5% students with 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.150
 cameras of diego martínez germanic or 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.150
