neck high one thing we all know is that

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.670 
neck high one thing we all know is that
when<00:00:31.789> you<00:00:31.880> take<00:00:32.029> length<00:00:32.450> away<00:00:32.810> from<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.350> short

when you take length away from a short

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680 
when you take length away from a short
board<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.490> add<00:00:34.700> width<00:00:35.240> or<00:00:35.630> thickness

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
board you have to add width or thickness

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.080 
board you have to add width or thickness
to<00:00:36.650> make<00:00:36.800> up<00:00:36.980> for<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.250> volume<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.760> you're

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
to make up for the volume that you're

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.000 
to make up for the volume that you're
losing<00:00:38.330> in<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.840> length<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.410> think<00:00:39.470> for<00:00:39.830> many

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
losing in the length I think for many

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.230 
losing in the length I think for many
surfers<00:00:40.430> there<00:00:40.640> comes<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.910> point<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.180> your

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
surfers there comes a point in your

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.880 
surfers there comes a point in your
short<00:00:41.570> boards<00:00:41.930> where<00:00:42.110> if<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.320> surf<00:00:42.560> aboard

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
short boards where if you surf aboard

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.440 
short boards where if you surf aboard
any<00:00:43.160> shorter<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:43.880> start<00:00:44.150> to<00:00:44.240> feel<00:00:44.420> like

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
any shorter you start to feel like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.300 
any shorter you start to feel like
you're<00:00:44.780> surfing<00:00:45.020> on<00:00:45.440> top<00:00:45.740> of<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.100> water

you're surfing on top of the water

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.160 
you're surfing on top of the water
because<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:46.820> how<00:00:47.000> much<00:00:47.090> volume<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.630> have<00:00:47.930> in

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
because of how much volume you have in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.200 
because of how much volume you have in
the<00:00:48.260> width<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:48.650> your<00:00:48.710> board<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:49.730> full

rails but if you keep your short boards
longer<00:00:52.550> than<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.850> point<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.330> can<00:00:53.480> still

longer than that point you can still

longer than that point you can still

mostly<00:01:58.039> because<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.399> told<00:01:58.579> Roberts<00:01:58.969> what<00:01:59.119> I

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
mostly because I told Roberts what I

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.669 
mostly because I told Roberts what I
wanted<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.509> feel<00:01:59.689> under<00:01:59.929> my<00:02:00.020> feet<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.499> they

wanted to feel under my feet and they

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.499 
wanted to feel under my feet and they
came<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.100> with<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.340> dimensions<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.359> also

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
came up with the dimensions but also

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.120 
came up with the dimensions but also
because<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.990> surfboard<00:02:03.409> industry<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.859> a<00:02:03.889> lot

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
volume in the rails so that I could have

by a factor of ten when you surf this
board<00:02:57.819> you'll<00:02:58.030> probably<00:02:58.209> find<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.019> tail

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
board you'll probably find that the tail

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.990 
board you'll probably find that the tail
is<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> little<00:02:59.769> bit<00:02:59.889> too<00:03:00.099> wide<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.670> go<00:03:00.790> really

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is a little bit too wide to go really

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.300 
is a little bit too wide to go really
good<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.629> three<00:03:01.959> fin<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.889> tail<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.280> not

so<00:03:03.760> wide<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.420> need<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:04.720> surf<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.079> with

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
so wide that you need to surf it with

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.410 
so wide that you need to surf it with
really<00:03:05.409> big<00:03:05.739> quad<00:03:06.310> trailers<00:03:06.849> when<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.180> set<00:03:07.389> up

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
really big quad trailers when you set up

any of your short boards as a quad the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.069 
any of your short boards as a quad the
general<00:03:09.670> rule<00:03:09.879> that<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.209> follow<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
general rule that you follow is that the

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.899 
general rule that you follow is that the
wider<00:03:11.349> your<00:03:11.590> tail<00:03:11.859> gets<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.400> bigger<00:03:12.670> your

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
wider your tail gets the bigger your

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.909 
wider your tail gets the bigger your
quad<00:03:13.150> trailers<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:13.900> that's<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:14.769> have

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
quad trailers get that's because we have

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.979 
quad trailers get that's because we have
more<00:03:15.160> surface<00:03:15.400> area<00:03:15.849> in<00:03:16.030> our<00:03:16.180> tail<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:16.780> need

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
more surface area in our tail we need

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.319 
more surface area in our tail we need
more<00:03:17.230> surface<00:03:17.650> area<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.220> our<00:03:18.430> fins<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:19.150> help

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
more surface area in our fins to help

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.050 
more surface area in our fins to help
give<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.599> tail<00:03:20.139> some<00:03:20.620> direction<00:03:21.400> instead<00:03:21.730> of

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
give that tail some direction instead of

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.849 
give that tail some direction instead of
just<00:03:22.239> spinning<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.870> control<00:03:23.019> on<00:03:23.620> this

board<00:03:24.190> with<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> tail<00:03:24.669> that<00:03:24.879> is<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.239> just<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
board with the tail that is not just a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.259 
board with the tail that is not just a
wide<00:03:26.049> squash<00:03:26.709> tail<00:03:27.040> coming<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:27.699> this<00:03:27.910> I

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
wide squash tail coming up like this I

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.020 
wide squash tail coming up like this I
can<00:03:28.510> surf<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.079> FCS<00:03:29.590> mf1<00:03:30.099> lead<00:03:30.699> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
can surf this with a FCS mf1 lead and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.879 
can surf this with a FCS mf1 lead and
gxq<00:03:31.810> trailer<00:03:32.290> when<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:32.590> hold<00:03:32.769> these

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
gxq trailer when we hold these

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.890 
gxq trailer when we hold these
side-by-side<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.609> can<00:03:33.849> see<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.359> gxq

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
side-by-side you can see that the gxq

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900 
side-by-side you can see that the gxq
trailer<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.470> clearly<00:03:35.859> much<00:03:36.129> smaller<00:03:36.549> than<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
trailer is clearly much smaller than the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.699 
trailer is clearly much smaller than the
mf1<00:03:37.209> lead<00:03:37.629> and<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:37.989> can<00:03:38.109> see<00:03:38.230> what<00:03:38.349> I<00:03:38.379> mean<00:03:38.590> and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
mf1 lead and you can see what I mean and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.229 
mf1 lead and you can see what I mean and
if<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.859> hold<00:03:38.949> the<00:03:39.099> fin<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.400> front<00:03:39.609> of<00:03:39.669> my<00:03:39.760> shirt<00:03:40.000> I

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
if I hold the fin in front of my shirt I

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.309 
if I hold the fin in front of my shirt I
think<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:40.599> is<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> board<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.169> might

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
think this is a board that you might

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.599 
think this is a board that you might
really<00:03:41.560> really<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.220> two<00:03:42.430> different
