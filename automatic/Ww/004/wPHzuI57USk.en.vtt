00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 good morning we are in Rome at the polyclinic 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.200
 this hymn twins as a professor 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.290
 rodolfo understand for this I thank you for 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.750
 being with us we talk about dermatology 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.360
 at the terminology units that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.400
 polyclinic and therefore we are in autumn 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.460
 let's see the problems that 81 have 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.350
 they go from complicating things to more 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.520
 simple but instead to the more pathologies 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 including a game of damage that the friend 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.130
 sun enemy created in the summer 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.110
 surely but I always see it with a 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 friend the sun a powerful 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 anti-inflammatory and indeed during the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 summertime 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 many inflammatory diseases such as the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.750
 psoriasis allergic dermatitis le 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.799
 atopic dermatitis have a period of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.259
 improvement unfortunately sooner or later 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.130
 this ends and then now in 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:15.090
 autumn with the lack of sun can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.369
 come back then return the psoriasis which 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 is that diseases with the disease 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.880
 congenital family in which there are 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.799
 these red spots with these scales 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.950
 silver can unfortunately appear 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:35.450
 zeman dermatitis especially tosa that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.159
 of hands but also in other places one 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 allergic dermatitis and then dermatitis 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.969
 atopica the search for new new ones 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.880
 medications can help in the moment 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.469
 which there is a resurgence of the disease 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.720
 certainly yes 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.700
 when I have 40 years ago 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.789
 began to do dermatology as 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.979
 student was said to psoriasis for 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.939
 example was people's illness 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.149
 healthy 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.950
 now it is said instead that it is a disease 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.630
 cutaneous yes but that has implications 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 general very very important the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.819
 psoriatic patient very often to one 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.950
 ie metabolic syndrome can be 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.090
 predisposed to heart attack to hypertension 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 etc. etc. 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.430
 now drugs that are born are born 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.420
 increasingly aimed at fighting relationships 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.840
 the mechanism that triggers psoriasis 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.100
 therefore it has gone from therapies among 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.250
 a concept that was a priest 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.950
 completely distorted by therapies 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.200
 as with retinoic acid with the ac 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.410
 idiot like 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.129
 the methotrexate that attacked the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 symptom 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.560
 therefore this hyper-proliferation of the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.870
 basal cells instead of drugs 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
 like the new biological drugs that go 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.150
 to act right on the beginning of that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.940
 cytokine cascade which then of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.569
 trigger psoriasis what we always 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.370
 more going towards the cause and no more 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.370
 only show the symptom
