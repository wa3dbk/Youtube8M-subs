it's<00:00:02.120> really<00:00:02.360> important<00:00:02.750> to<00:00:02.929> choose<00:00:03.139> a<00:00:03.199> stake

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
it's really important to choose a stake

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.990 
it's really important to choose a stake
that<00:00:03.800> allows<00:00:04.010> you<00:00:04.220> to<00:00:04.250> hold<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:04.729> largest

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
that allows you to hold the largest

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.970 
that allows you to hold the largest
potential<00:00:05.420> catch<00:00:05.779> and<00:00:06.529> that's<00:00:06.620> going<00:00:06.919> to

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
potential catch and that's going to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.640 
potential catch and that's going to
depend<00:00:07.189> to<00:00:07.970> a<00:00:08.000> large<00:00:08.090> degree<00:00:08.540> upon<00:00:09.350> the<00:00:09.469> type

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
again the type of substrate you're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.390 
again the type of substrate you're
working<00:00:37.490> in<00:00:37.640> about<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.500> 18<00:00:39.500> inch<00:00:39.620> steak<00:00:39.950> is<00:00:40.190> good

working in about a 18 inch steak is good

working in about a 18 inch steak is good
for<00:00:40.610> clay<00:00:40.820> soils<00:00:41.240> but<00:00:41.420> you're<00:00:41.510> gonna<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.780> to

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
for clay soils but you're gonna have to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.260 
for clay soils but you're gonna have to
go<00:00:41.990> longer<00:00:42.440> if<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:42.650> have<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.100> slightly<00:00:43.700> looser

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
go longer if you have a slightly looser

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.400 
go longer if you have a slightly looser
soil<00:00:45.310> kind<00:00:46.310> of<00:00:46.400> same<00:00:46.610> idea<00:00:47.090> with<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.020> regular

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
probably 24 to 30 inches if your coyote

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.520 
probably 24 to 30 inches if your coyote
trapping<00:00:55.240> probably<00:00:56.240> anywhere<00:00:56.690> between<00:00:56.870> 18

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530

trapping probably anywhere between 18
and<00:00:57.560> 24<00:00:58.220> if<00:00:58.520> you're<00:00:58.670> racking<00:00:58.850> trapping<00:00:59.630> the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
and 24 if you're racking trapping the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.910 
and 24 if you're racking trapping the
bullet<00:01:00.800> stake<00:01:01.130> is<00:01:01.580> nice<00:01:02.000> because<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.600> sets<00:01:03.590> and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
bullet stake is nice because it sets and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160 
bullet stake is nice because it sets and
just<00:01:04.280> about<00:01:04.430> any<00:01:04.640> type<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:04.939> substrate<00:01:05.600> what

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
just about any type of substrate what

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.999 
just about any type of substrate what
happens<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.950> push<00:01:07.579> it<00:01:07.789> into<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.149> ground

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
happens is you push it into the ground

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.700 
happens is you push it into the ground
all<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.310> way<00:01:10.399> up<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.820> top<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:12.259> table

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
all the way up to the top of the table

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.499 
all the way up to the top of the table
and<00:01:13.159> then<00:01:14.090> pull<00:01:14.409> your<00:01:15.409> applicator<00:01:15.950> out<00:01:16.509> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
and then pull your applicator out and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.590 
and then pull your applicator out and
give<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:17.719> a<00:01:17.869> jerk<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.499> it<00:01:19.130> turns<00:01:19.369> sideways<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
give it a jerk and it turns sideways and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.669 
give it a jerk and it turns sideways and
you<00:01:20.659> have<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> lot<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:22.090> holding<00:01:23.090> power

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
you have a lot of holding power

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.260 
you have a lot of holding power
underground<00:01:24.679> it's<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.369> real<00:01:25.609> good<00:01:25.759> choice<00:01:25.969> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
underground it's a real good choice the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.849 
underground it's a real good choice the
one<00:01:26.390> thing<00:01:26.659> about<00:01:26.689> these<00:01:27.049> is<00:01:27.109> you<00:01:27.469> have<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.740> be

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
one thing about these is you have to be

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.499 
one thing about these is you have to be
careful<00:01:28.280> about<00:01:28.880> leaving<00:01:29.359> them<00:01:29.479> behind

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
careful about leaving them behind

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.379 
careful about leaving them behind
because<00:01:30.340> sometimes<00:01:31.340> farm<00:01:31.670> equipment<00:01:31.909> when

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
because sometimes farm equipment when

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:33.999 
because sometimes farm equipment when
they're<00:01:32.509> cultivating<00:01:33.170> they'll<00:01:33.649> grab<00:01:33.829> ahold

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
they're cultivating they'll grab ahold

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.760 
they're cultivating they'll grab ahold
of<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.280> cable<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.999> it<00:01:35.090> can<00:01:35.319> cause<00:01:36.319> damage<00:01:36.740> to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of that cable and it can cause damage to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.709 
of that cable and it can cause damage to
their<00:01:37.039> farm<00:01:37.280> equipment<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:37.969> you<00:01:38.389> don't<00:01:38.569> want

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
their farm equipment so you don't want

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.349 
their farm equipment so you don't want
to<00:01:38.780> leave<00:01:38.899> them<00:01:39.020> behind<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:40.460> washer<00:01:40.850> stake<00:01:41.149> is

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
to leave them behind the washer stake is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.529 
to leave them behind the washer stake is
real<00:01:41.600> good<00:01:41.780> choice<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.889> the<00:01:43.009> water<00:01:43.219> line

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
real good choice on the water line

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.649 
real good choice on the water line
especially<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.499> looser<00:01:46.399> soils<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.509> can

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
especially in in looser soils you can

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.020 
especially in in looser soils you can
use<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.869> washer<00:01:48.469> anywhere<00:01:49.280> from<00:01:49.429> two<00:01:49.670> inches

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
use a washer anywhere from two inches

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.609 
use a washer anywhere from two inches
down<00:01:50.389> to<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.659> think<00:01:50.719> about<00:01:50.959> an<00:01:51.229> inch<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.560> a

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
down to I think about an inch and a

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.279 
down to I think about an inch and a
quarter<00:01:51.829> again<00:01:52.789> same<00:01:53.149> idea<00:01:53.569> you<00:01:53.929> push<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.770> in

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
quarter again same idea you push it in

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.800 
quarter again same idea you push it in
into<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.409> soil<00:01:57.679> give<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.759> tug<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.389> it's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
into the soil give it a tug and it's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.980 
into the soil give it a tug and it's
going<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.020> set<00:02:00.819> against<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:02.029> against<00:02:02.959> the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
going to set against the against the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.230 
going to set against the against the
soil<00:02:03.259> like<00:02:03.529> that<00:02:03.770> give<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.249> test<00:02:04.520> make<00:02:05.209> sure

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
soil like that give it a test make sure
