00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.430
 more 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.730
 hello everyone knows Herat Bages 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.750
 and today I will introduce you 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.660
 a little video 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 invented by sorry life for those who 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.020
 prefer and so it's mostly a 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.260
 video to show you the difference 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.809
 shock clips between the msr and them 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.100
 are 18 years old who are two snipers or the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.820
 ours who are the two snipers or 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.700
 modern warfare 3 that really changes 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.559
 left of the back up it's call of duty 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.830
 modern warfare 2 all the previous 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.630
 does not succeed and frankly it's 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.320
 really good it's really cool that 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.520
 they did that change 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.290
 it's really a good idea to put 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.740
 two it's not where is it actually 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.920
 aesthetically different really it's 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.370
 really two sets 6-0 stikeman so 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.320
 for those who prefer who want to 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.430
 remember a little the intervention and its 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.670
 down the msr and there and for those who 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 preferred the n96 sma of the call of 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 duty black ops 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 the 118 she is there too 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.880
 so that's how you know them 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.759
 quick scope are present in modern 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.329
 warfare 3 of course otherwise we will not 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.740
 call it a model to do too much and that 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.969
 makes really very very well 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.659
 I do not know if you could see 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.060
 but look here obviously it's me 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.229
 who I think is good but it fits 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.630
 really well what obviously I find 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.950
 to be precise is weight 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.450
 rooster in last May this park 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.560
 we were about three years old 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.829
 affected here it must be precise that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 returns as soon as the l1 key is pressed 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.990
 because on ps3 as soon as 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.370
 we need touch l1 and then we shoot 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.360
 that's okay what's it's not like 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.180
 the coop that's all going extremely the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 name that we can really chain 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.840
 buttocks of patients 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.150
 we chose the map little water that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.719
 is we have discussed with whom I have 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.989
 discussed with my mates who are who 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.510
 play with me who has kamikazes 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:00.280
 it has a youtube channel if you want 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.180
 go see the video a34 I compared are 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.430
 not bad 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.010
 he often goes doubts 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.010
 there are others than Milan but oh 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.440
 et al, 2000 to 27 units and estimated 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.940
 that the plays that is part of my team 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.310
 who is the co-leader of the ti and 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.900
 the publisher of my videos 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.530
 So here it goes a little more about this 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 who embarrassed and besides I held 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.790
 really to thank them for having 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.910
 wanted to do that video with me at 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.650
 beyond Christ and level-5 18 years is 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.900
 not huge but I feel that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.329
 msf fires but the lock faster 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.930
 that the 118 ls no it's just a 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.840
 impression 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.220
 I do not know but it's really me 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.220
 really gives that impression to what 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:09.150
 so yeah I said we discussed 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.760
 we thought to ourselves that gives and amap 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 to make games with friends like 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.579
 we're doing right now and frankly 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.989
 she is fine finally I like it 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.549
 like a lot of modern art fashion 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.549
 they are at his class 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.400
 that's good it was really a 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.539
 I asked al 2001 we had 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.219
 landal declined to the others dom was the 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:43.909
 smaller map is the most adequate 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:45.349
 for because this kind of this one here so 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.439
 I'm going I was just holding on to you too 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:52.280
 to say that I'm going to make videos of 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:55.370
 future videos that will be dismantling of 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.150
 commands and how to live and tahri 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:03.919
 also other pans life that I do not know 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:06.560
 just do both so I hope 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:13.659
 that I subscribe to my dear 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.659
