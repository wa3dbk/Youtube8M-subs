00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.070
 let's make a hole 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 of the six segments of our square 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.589
 then as if it were only the politicians are already selected 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.709
 if you are not stuck 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.519
 back to selection 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.820
 or the UN 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 you will have to wipe selected 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.999

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.539
 We go to the worker alternately a few moments, I go 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.529

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 and the document can be turned off. 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.740

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.720
 although it is not red 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.400
 your cd is pressed and q2 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.990

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.300
 in the module that everything happens well 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.350
 OK 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.400
 when a penis is attached 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.140
 sometimes it does not appear 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.150
 No problem, we'll do what? 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.140
 We are going to reset 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 I make an extra today 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.930
 inside not right 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.280
 because if I did not vote this part flooded I need a rare day to day to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.130
 same thing I have here 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260

 Okay, everybody wants to go back to the national team. 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.460
 So when you have 6 and 3 years there 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.460

 cheryl cole who made the commission and the center will do 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.320
 it's complicated 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.320
 this horny crisis does not come to seven 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.069

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.459
 of our part 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.719
 I could select now is phase by phase 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.909
 next way 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.909

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.819
 van der sar change this selection here 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.559

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.559
 which are the polygons that are part of cities for example 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.269
 one two three four that are on his side toshio to hold a little control 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.349
 the keyboard 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.379
 and click 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.669
 in Portugal 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.429
 there happened 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:50.029
 those politicians who were around that vert the same thing works with 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:50.959
 the doctor 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.799
 if I have to be selected here 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.510
 which are the mails are part of it that receipt if you have to contact a 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.660
 polygon by having it 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.669
 this selection 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.579
 so stay here 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 we have that selection dr 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.199
 and I'll see that every time I'm 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.599
 huh 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.469
 alternating if you have a process can also 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.809
 work or so or so 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.539
 what we already see the two engines of time 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.229
 I'll hold the check 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.310
 in erechim I have all these lines selected here 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.129
 second meeting 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.039
 in piripiri 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.199
 let's check he selected here all this region 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.759
 What do I do now? 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.759
 show you whose grohl principle 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.759
 I came back very close to taste what would 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.669
 the judge of the young man who narrates that in the case 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:45.790
 does not work 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.360
 so he did not look for us 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.620
 the project is growing to the selection 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.150
 having to pay all debts that are on the side in vain is adding 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.289
 a little above the people 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.280
 great course in which the company 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.559
 then its own growth and it diminishes that selection 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.400
 as in polymer I have 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.279

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.209
