00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.140
I’m finally here.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.580
Solvalla.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.340
[Elitloppet, sunday 31 may, 11.50]

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.040
This is it.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.500
Shit, it’s so exciting.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.880
Feels like tingly soda runs in my body.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.640
Luckily I am in very good shape.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.700
And I’m glad my friend Ravi is by my side.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.720
Ravi: Come on buddy, let’s do this!

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.640
I’m in the zone. In the zone.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640
Holy smoke, that’s a lot of people!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.960
Have they really come to see me?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.920
And all the TV cameras, technical things and stuff.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560
I better focus.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.040
I wonder if mom is here?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.220
OK, let’s gain some speed and make an impression.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.240
Come on now Vinnie!

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.800
Interviewer: Hello Vinnie, what a spectacular welcoming from the Solvalla audience.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.020
Interviewer: How does it feel, are you nervous?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.340
Vinnie: Well, I don’t know.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.080
Vinnie: I just want to run. It’s like dream this whole thing.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.920
Interviewer: But this is real. You and Ravi are actually here. Is there anything you want to say to your fans?

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.000
Vinnie: Fight on and never give up. No dream is too big.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.160
Vinnie: Thanks for coming. And I would like to greet someone on Mothers Day.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.180
Vinnie: Look mom, I did it!

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.000
Interviewer: Wonderful. Good luck Vinnie. Could we have a big round of applause for Vinnie the dreamer!

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.680
Savor the moment.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.240
Enjoy this.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.720
Carpe Diem Ravi. Enjoy!
