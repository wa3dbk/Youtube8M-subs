00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.449
 start beam only 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:02.899
 making sure necessary 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.270
 amount of fuel mixture and party as well 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.260
 lubrication oils cycle 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.340
 stretch the tree and think what 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.529
 factors can affect the beam 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.989
 is the tree worth exactly Ilya but tilted in 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.569
 which side is blowing wind 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.569
 which side should the tree fall 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.669
 clear the area around the tree from 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.389
 suspension obstructing 

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.119
 cutting down 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.339
 clean branches and other interfering 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.589
 earth objects 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.019
 for sent beams 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.919
 necessary first with a saw 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.200
 make on a tree trunk drowned 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.210
 which will determine the direction of the fall 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.830
 the tree at the beginning is made oblique 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.790
 top arrest 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 at an angle of about 60 degrees 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.850
 must have drunk a tree 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 about 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.590
 20 25 percent of its diameter after that 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.560
 horizontal arrest is being made 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.030
 which should descend h 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 then you need to perform 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.120
 horizontal registry 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 drank a little higher under the beer 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.300
 it is extremely important to stop the epidemic 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.219
 just before 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.429
 how is the manager drunk 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.560
 and leave the so-called did not pay 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.340
 no hold that mole of the tree on the stump 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.979
 and ensures the fall of the tree in 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.340
 predetermined direction thickness of the negative 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.259
 should be 10 percent diameter 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.640
 tree or at least two centimeters 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 let's first define 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.600
 what to do if the tire saw 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.970
 length and diameter money 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.310
 stand and spread your legs shoulder-width apart 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.690
 lean against a tree trunk with 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.480
 lest it leave too high 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.650
 clearly make the guide sawed 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.320
 as low as possible 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.640
 hold the saw at the right angle and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.100
 sends it to your choice 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.680
 landmark 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.670
 it must coincide with the guides 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 risks on the body of the saw 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.930
 start the engines and start sawing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.270
 occasional adoption persists 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.049
 whether the correct angle of inclination 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.910
 and directions owl 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.150
 staying the same position make 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.440
 bottom pic subscription make sure he 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.520
 exactly the same as the top slope 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.299
 briskly 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.299
 now it is time to make it propyl 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.969
 use either top or bottom 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.249
 more often 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.049
 great until it is 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.819
 enough space to deliver 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.839
 beam shovel 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.029
 make sure the beam doesnâ€™t 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.970
 concerns rotating chains 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.849
 when you keep singer 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.870
 leave uniform in width and do not give 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.309
 drank as much as possible 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.789
 pull out the saw and work the beam 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.359
 blades until the tree starts 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.329
 fall 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.859
 canned shovel is a tool for rolls 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.319
 small trees with it you can 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.909
 prevent the tree from falling into 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.349
 unwanted direction 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.379
 and clamping the saw apparatus during 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.379
 epidemics 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.909
 Now we will talk about working with large 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.239
 trees 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.969
 still need to create 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.849
 proper working area 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.189
 it may be necessary to remove the branches below 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.119
 the trunk 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.469
 the safest way to do it 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.589
 work the lower part is motionless 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.719
 top down 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.180
 use the trunk as protection between 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.120
 you and pylori 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.530
 never near these higher level branches 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.099
 shoulders 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.620
 if the tree has root flows 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.620
 better to remove them 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.979
 in this case, the vertex is shorter than the diameter 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.820
 tree 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.680
 therefore it is required to apply several 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.139
 complicated technique rolls 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.239
 because the tire won't pass through the trunk 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.380
 tree completely 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.020
 will finish the guide drank 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.490
 will have the opposite 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.790
 hand tree make sure new 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.530
 rails coincide with those made earlier 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.000
 so accurate 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 as much as possible 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.339
 the reception you see is called in 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.329
 Ryazan 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.249
 start the engine at full power 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.089
 start to insert the bottom of the tip 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.160
 tire trunk 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.100
 directly behind the intended 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.180
 negative 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.289
 be careful not to touch the tree 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.449
 top of the tip of the tire 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.110
 when the tip of you will be a little 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.229
 immersed in the barrel gently turn 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.740
 the pilot so that her position was 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.590
 parallel to the guide under 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.080
 of beer 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.080
 name cars to get in your way 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.199
 after that go on a small 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.669
 distance from the negative 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.620
 approximately our violations 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.620
 thanks to this you can avoid 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.650
 risks bump will not let 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.889
 when turning the saw 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.969
 walk carefully around the trunk 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.240
 reaching the middle by the way beam wedge 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.069
 the best tool for felling large trees 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.389
 keep moving painted will not take 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.619
 parallel position 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:03.060
 guides under Kiev 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 slept on the opposite side 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.029
 if while falling a tree is stuck in 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.210
 friend trees you should also 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.580
 seek help from professionals 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.400
 if you need help 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 do not leave the tree unattended 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.770
 if the tire is stuck in the trunk do not try 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.839
 pull out saws 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.829
 stop and engine and press 

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:34.990
 on the table on both sides of the cut 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.250
 until the saw comes out of it
