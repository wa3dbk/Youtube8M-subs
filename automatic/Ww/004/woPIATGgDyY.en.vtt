00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.379
 hello and welcome we are 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.670
 today in Spain on the mythical 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.480
 Valencia route that closes the season 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.009
 motogp 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.200
 we are here today for the 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.679
 launch of the new yamaha yzfr6 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.679
 2012 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 appeared in 1998 in the motorcycle segment 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.899
 sports 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.640
 yamaha r1 made its revolution in 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.460
 2009 with a new declination 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 largely inspired by the motogp m1 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 the new 4 cylinders in line of 9 198 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.839
 cubic centimeters then inherits the famous 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.040
 kalach crossplane while the sequence 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.530
 ignition on this type of architectured 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.030
 hitherto functional by pair the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.489
 crossplane technology is to offer 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.260
 with each pistons his own sequence with 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.449
 to the key a net boost of torque at low 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.300
 and mid diets and especially a sound 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.739
 worthy of the motocross 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.320
 three years later the r1 is remade a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.210
 health for 2012 while retaining the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.840
 engine and the cycle part of the previous 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.670
 vintages 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.770
 the sports yama receives some 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.940
 subtle aesthetic evolutions the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 new optics and the fork head 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.960
 redesigned reinforces clearly 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640
 the aggressiveness of the line while the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.259
 already finishing the cellars is enriched with a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.860
 beautiful fork tee at day is in 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.140
 aluminum 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.550
 to say that the diva remains one 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 the most beautiful sports of the moment 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.090
 especially as the new stroke of pencil 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 exhausts gives off more the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.729
 back part for more fluidity 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.229
 the real change of this r1 2012 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.210
 is not to look for the side 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.549
 lines but rather under his fuselage 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.560
 in the heart of its prestigious mechanics 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.180
 the big novelty on these grounds 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.040
 2012 is the appearance of the control of 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.270
 traction so yamaha joined most 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 builders by integrating this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 electronic assistance on the four 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.360
 crossblock cylinders a system 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 which is here adjustable in six positions 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.550
 and that totally disconnectable for 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.550
 more experienced 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.210
 in practice the traction control system 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.869
 detects the slightest loss of adhesion 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.820
 Rear wheel 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.920
 in this case an electronic calculator 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
 takes care of intervening on the butterflies 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.759
 injector inlet or ignition 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.830
 to regulate the motor response is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.330
 found the grip the driver is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.980
 as for him warned of the setting in action 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 of the system by a light indicator 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.000
 on the dashboard 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.040
 the yamaha tc is configurable on the handlebars 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.960
 if it has to be stopped to disable 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 the system it is possible to choose 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.450
 among six modes offered by rolling to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.670
 condition to cut the gases to close 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 the embedded electronic chapter note 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.520
 that the r1 retains its three 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.500
 engine maps that allow 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.240
 soften or strengthen the mid-diets 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.240
 with a simple push or handlebar 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.239
 despite the arrival of traction control the r1 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.379
 remains true to itself in terms of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.900
 dynamic behavior 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.120
 we always appreciate its economy rather 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.430
 nice for a sporty her engine 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.230
 filled and expressive as well as his train 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.650
 before both incisive and stable in 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.290
 curve 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.390
 on the other hand the yamaha superbike remains 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.010
 impressive young sportsman that he is well 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.260
 difficult to correct once she 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 is on his trajectory 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.549
 the r1 remains no less sensational 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.439
 to drive and above all very efficient 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.730
 must say that the arrival of the tcs meets 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.099
 perfectly to one of the achilles heels 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.140
 old vintages namely the 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.040
 roughness of the 4 cylinders at the delivery of 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.209
 gas 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.190
 whatever mode is chosen 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 device now allows everyone to 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.109
 make the most of the r1 in all 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.459
 security and above all with confidence 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.750
 to say that the staff yamaha account 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.519
 a lot about this progress for 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.319
 revitalize the career of her sportswoman 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.090
 as confirmed by Alexandre 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.030
 kowalski marketing director and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.549
 communication at yamaha motor france 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.590
 there is for this novelty 2012 so 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.510
 the new traction control called tcs 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.680
 traction control system I say before 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.239
 all for security issues 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.530
 because it's true that for a 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.810
 gas opening a little too violent 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.540
 Perhaps the client driver is done 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.859
 an inopportune glide that can if it 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.609
 is really very important so 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.690
 lead to the fall 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.820
 so it's true that for us too 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.579
 it's very important because I would say 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.739
 that yamaha motor france has always animated 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.270
 and supported sales of this type of 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.620
 machine through programs 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.330
 athletes through programs of 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000
 rolling customers through pilots 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.050
 dealer support and that's 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.240
 something that for us is very 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.500
 important and I think we are we are 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.070
 pleased to welcome this new r1 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.449
 for for 2012 in France 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.970
 display a rate identical to the old 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.690
 model is 15000 999 euros in its 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.120
 standard version 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.330
 the yamaha r1 undeniably wins in 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.220
 maturity with the arrival 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.289
 traction control remains to be composed 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.389
 with its plumpness certainly appreciable 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.919
 on the road but penalizing on circuit 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.949
 especially against the new queens of the 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.949
 category
