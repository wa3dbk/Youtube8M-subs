00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.630
 it's probably not without reason that in the 80s Saturday was 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.980
 considered the capital of the truffle today the fish farms 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.440
 are still present around the city of the port d'armé in places 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.139
 but which remains particularly attractive fish farming mattenet 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.470
 gabrielle with days in the 50's the business was always family 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.710
 today it employs 15 people and has about 30 basins 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.859
 farmed, that is to say an average of 20 tons of truffles 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.320
 fish imported from France track that has several months in 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 basins fed by the emb had both been puking to refute what makes the 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.590
 particularity of these small cultural sites enough his studio both 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.010
 transformations we must always innovate we must always stay at the cutting edge 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 10th Regulatory Matter what does it change everything evolves every day 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.300
 we must always follow trends so that it is at the product level 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 smoked 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.790
 but that is the challenge of the costs for example the trout frêche son is in 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.430
 head without that without stop 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.290
 so it avoids having to remove the edges for the children for example to 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.560
 the house what will be able to rediscover a little there rather family 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.020
 who had a little forgotten in favor of fish already prepared for 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.309
 hundred of the very famous brands and if Iran only produces on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.350
 order every day it's almost a ton of fresh or smoked fish that 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 come out of workshops 1 to go all over Belgium 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.440
 stay in the leading car and that is to know who evolves with his time 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.850
 and cope with the many demands of the job 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 you have to be in the field all the time all the time 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.979
 to drown the fish in order to watch the top to wake up 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.860
 and the six piscivorous birds that come a little swell 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.539
 today from time to time 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.729
 must be in constant contact with veterinarians standards 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.230
 sanitary and all that follows 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.219
 times all the time there 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.219
 but then what makes the beauty of this job 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.760
 only place on our site 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.170
 their job where we will touch everything 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.560
 we put in customers we are in the workshop we are outside we are 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.280
 in a beautiful setting 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.929
 and especially for the pride of always having a family product and map 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.879
 to do this it has a clear priority and for those who quote the 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.849
 field to open their doors to the public it is also a way of doing 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.040
 too many shots 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.800
