00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 is a house that has above all a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.570
 the credited at one point of a balcony 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 you see all the vehicles in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.360
 rio de janeiro 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 you arrive at guanabara bay and the bread 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 sugar you see the redeeming christ 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.070
 behind you arrives Rodrigo Lagoon 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.109
 freitas 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 You see the hill, two brothers and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 stone of the gávea was this landscape that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.220
 somehow determined the solution 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.220
 architectural house 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 there is a house on site 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.980
 there is always a house 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.570
 There is a lot of difficulty in voting for the house. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 down make another technique 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.629
 we ended up putting the house down 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 we made another house that is very 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 happy she has three stories 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 you enter through the intermediate level where 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.530
 the rooms are down you have the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.899
 four children and the intimate part of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 family and up you have as if 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 was an owner's apartment 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.490
 he the woman has up there another 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 independent apartment launched up to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.850
 a small independent pool for 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 they are such 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 she has an interesting insert one day 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 capture with a work of art that has a 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.420
 large panel made by an artist 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 plastic that I actually imagined 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.759
 make a graphite panel a thing 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 so the owner said not to see 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.479
 no, I want to do 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.500
 adriano de aquino interesting panel 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.970
 on here 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.259
 the panel is very interesting that it is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 reflective 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.649
 it will gradient from the blue of the sky to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.649
 forest or rather the forest 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.370
 it has an interesting principle of 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.760
 sustainability because it has one that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.770
 was a vertical rip in the middle of the house 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.830
 where is light and area a trait 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.890
 horizontal where it also enters lusíada 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.050
 then these spaces intercommunicate and the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.959
 house obviously consumes less energy 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.970
 better lit some balconies 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.810
 these balconies two roofs with 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 athletes move and she also has 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.190
 some sliding panels that also 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.520
 with a Venetian giant somehow 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.100
 control the light and determine if you 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.830
 want more here - if you want to see 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.590
 landscape but does not want to be assaulted by 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.230
 she finally and these panels slide 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.450
 electronically from outside the house and 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.640
 Also the house has one thing that I use 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.590
 very much and I think the Rio de Janeiro 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.180
 important is liberal 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.700
 I think it's not in rio de janeiro I think 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.400
 that tropical architecture needs to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.320
 see the liberal make a very 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.320
 natural from the inside to the outside 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.150
 the predominant material that makes the 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.820
 unification of the house is a floor in the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.010
 society is a perverted marble floor and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.740
 in the intimate wood 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.740
 then this is unified as it enters 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.050
 inside the spaces all gives a 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.180
 certain simplicity is not the type of house 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.080
 that you open a door and have a 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.450
 surprise 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.910
 you always have a natural continuity 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 and the walls all clear white is a 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.180
 house that I like very much for the cleaning 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:40.040
 the amplitude for simplicity by this 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.830
 sustainable order 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.130
 concerns about energy and the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.560
 in a house that has a 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.560
 on a lookout place the mirage
