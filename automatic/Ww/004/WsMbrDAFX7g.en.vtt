 this predator this here aggression 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.140
 already bengal must never let u 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.210
 yourself for the reason that if

 Bengals play in them very much 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.739
 their character and most important 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.480
 their amazing voice

 Bengals because you see the smell of hands 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.650

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.750
 the cats were eventually blown away 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.240
