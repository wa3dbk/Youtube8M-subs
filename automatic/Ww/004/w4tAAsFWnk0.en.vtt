00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
guitar cabinets and different types of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.410 
guitar cabinets and different types of
mics<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> found<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
mics but what I found is this this is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.440 
mics but what I found is this this is
called<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.170> cab<00:00:40.559> grabber<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.940> made<00:00:42.210> by<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
called a cab grabber and it's made by a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
called a cab grabber and it's made by a
company<00:00:42.690> called<00:00:42.870> Audax<00:00:43.440> oughta<00:00:43.800> call<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
company called Audax oughta call so

company called Audax oughta call so
makes<00:00:44.489> microphones<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.780> talked<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.200> one

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
makes microphones and I talked about one

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
makes microphones and I talked about one
of<00:00:46.559> their<00:00:46.710> microphones<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> previous

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of their microphones in a previous

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.520 
of their microphones in a previous
lesson<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> i-5<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.079> sure<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> check<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
lesson the i-5 be sure to check that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.700 
lesson the i-5 be sure to check that
lesson<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.570> about<00:00:51.570> miking<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.110> guitar<00:00:52.440> amp

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
lesson out about miking your guitar amp

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.549 
lesson out about miking your guitar amp
but<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.000> does<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.930> allows<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but what this does is this allows you to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.849 
but what this does is this allows you to
attach<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.340> microphone<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.379> then

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
attach a microphone to it and then

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.389 
attach a microphone to it and then
attach<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.760> device<00:00:59.820> directly<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
attach this device directly to the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
attach this device directly to the
guitar<00:01:02.699> cabinet<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.049> an

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
guitar cabinet here it is I have an

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.280 
guitar cabinet here it is I have an
audix<00:01:04.470> i-5<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.299> I<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.840> attached<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
audix i-5 and I just attached the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.730 
audix i-5 and I just attached the
microphone<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
microphone there and it has this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.600 
microphone there and it has this
spring-loaded<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> rubber<00:01:11.159> band<00:01:11.400> or

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
spring-loaded or a rubber band or

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
spring-loaded or a rubber band or
whatever<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> thing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
whatever is in this thing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.910 
whatever is in this thing
that<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:15.119> expand<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> pull<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that actually will expand if you pull on

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.550 
that actually will expand if you pull on
it<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.520> springs<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.350> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it and then it springs back so what this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.090 
it and then it springs back so what this
does<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.850> allows<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.080> isolate<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
does is it allows you to isolate the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.570 
does is it allows you to isolate the
microphone<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:24.270> onto<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> cabinet<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
microphone right onto the cabinet and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.770 
microphone right onto the cabinet and
that's<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:26.759> important<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> couple<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that's pretty important for a couple of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.219 
that's pretty important for a couple of
reasons

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
reasons

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.999 
reasons
one<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.630> old<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:31.020> most<00:01:31.439> times<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
one is the old way most times you have a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
one is the old way most times you have a
boom<00:01:32.250> microphone<00:01:32.610> or<00:01:33.150> some<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
boom microphone or some kind of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
boom microphone or some kind of
microphone<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> stance<00:01:35.159> sitting<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.939> front

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
microphone on a stance sitting in front

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
microphone on a stance sitting in front
of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> amplifier<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.350> sitting<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of the amplifier that's sitting on the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
of the amplifier that's sitting on the
stage<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.299> making<00:01:39.630> your

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
stage and that that's you're making your

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.730 
stage and that that's you're making your
amp<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.750> pain<00:01:43.020> because

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
amp with and that that's a pain because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
amp with and that that's a pain because
first<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:45.270> happens<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.930> lot<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
first of all what happens is a lot of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
first of all what happens is a lot of
times<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> gets<00:01:46.530> knocked<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.250> lot<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
times it gets knocked around a lot you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
times it gets knocked around a lot you
know<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.820> over<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.119> rocking<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.659> you

stages you get a lot of that stage
rumble<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.170> could<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.500> picked<00:02:01.770> up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
rumble and then that could get picked up

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
rumble and then that could get picked up
by<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> microphone<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.780> that's<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
boom of that stand is shaking and a lot

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
boom of that stand is shaking and a lot
of<00:02:08.250> times<00:02:08.550> -<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> don't<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.420> having<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of times - I don't like having that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.990 
of times - I don't like having that
microphone<00:02:10.830> stand<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.970> front

microphone stand right there in front

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.350 
microphone stand right there in front

the<00:03:48.310> side<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.850> amp<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.330> will<00:03:49.540> cover<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
the side of the amp it will cover the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550 
the side of the amp it will cover the
distance<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.180> kind<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.600> stretch<00:03:53.530> it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
distance so you just kind of stretch it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.979 
distance so you just kind of stretch it
out<00:03:53.830> then<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.489> put<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.420> about<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
out then you put it on and about the

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.390 
out then you put it on and about the
placement<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.500> want<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.950> then<00:03:57.100> let<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.280> go

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
placement you want and then let it go

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.229 
placement you want and then let it go
and<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.299> compresses<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.170> then<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.700> your

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.229 
and it compresses and then you have your
arm<00:04:02.230> here<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.190> could<00:04:03.310> loosen<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:03.700> color

and then find this kind of you could
kind<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.030> turn<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.630> find<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.110> sweet<00:04:08.410> spot

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
toward the edge and you could anchor it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.819 
toward the edge and you could anchor it

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
or you can go straight on and then it's
