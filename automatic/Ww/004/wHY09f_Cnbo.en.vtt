water change where the water is pumped

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.020 
water change where the water is pumped
into<00:02:29.240> my<00:02:29.720> tank<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.470> water<00:02:30.650> here<00:02:31.190> rises<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
into my tank and the water here rises to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.260 
into my tank and the water here rises to
this<00:02:32.180> switch<00:02:32.540> which<00:02:33.290> floats<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:35.090> it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
this switch which floats and then it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.720 
this switch which floats and then it
shuts<00:02:35.480> off<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.840> water<00:02:36.140> coming<00:02:36.710> in<00:02:36.830> then

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
shuts off the water coming in then

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.840 
shuts off the water coming in then
another<00:02:38.240> pump<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.900> triggered<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.860> take<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
another pump is triggered to take the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.300 
another pump is triggered to take the
old<00:02:41.060> water<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.680> here

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
old water out to about here

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
old water out to about here
and<00:02:43.460> once<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.300> hits<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.290> bottom<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.830> shuts

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
and once this hits the bottom it shuts

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.100 
and once this hits the bottom it shuts
that<00:02:46.340> off<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.210> tank<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:47.630> stabilizes

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that off and the tank then stabilizes

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.070 
that off and the tank then stabilizes
again<00:02:48.500> right<00:02:48.710> around<00:02:49.040> where<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.550> now<00:02:50.080> also

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
again right around where it is now also

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.940 
again right around where it is now also
had<00:02:51.500> him<00:02:51.710> build<00:02:51.980> me<00:02:52.160> these<00:02:53.170> which<00:02:54.170> are<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.800> my

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
had him build me these which are for my

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.390 
had him build me these which are for my
auto<00:02:55.190> top<00:02:55.520> off<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.060> dosing<00:02:57.050> now<00:02:58.040> I'm<00:02:58.220> using

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
auto top off and dosing now I'm using

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.040 
auto top off and dosing now I'm using
the<00:02:58.610> ones<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.000> are<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.390> side<00:02:59.720> but<00:02:59.960> you

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
the ones that are on that side but you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.660 
the ones that are on that side but you
can't<00:03:00.290> see<00:03:00.560> them<00:03:00.740> from<00:03:00.860> here<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.370> I'll<00:03:01.490> show

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
can't see them from here so I'll show

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.340 
can't see them from here so I'll show
you<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.300> had<00:03:02.480> them<00:03:02.570> put<00:03:02.600> them<00:03:02.990> on<00:03:03.140> both

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
you this I had them put them on both

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.050 
you this I had them put them on both
sides<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.190> case<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.520> wanted<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.820> run<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
sides just in case I wanted to run it

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.940 
sides just in case I wanted to run it
from<00:03:05.150> left<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.450> right<00:03:05.690> or<00:03:05.930> right<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:06.230> left

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
now I have as you can see my auto top

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.770 
now I have as you can see my auto top
off<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> red<00:03:10.550> one<00:03:10.730> then<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.300> four

off is the red one then I have four
others<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:12.680> my<00:03:12.800> GHL<00:03:13.370> doser<00:03:13.820> just<00:03:14.210> behind<00:03:14.420> this

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
others for my GHL doser just behind this

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.780 
others for my GHL doser just behind this
pipe<00:03:15.200> here<00:03:16.600> then<00:03:17.600> he<00:03:18.290> also<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.920> also<00:03:19.220> had<00:03:19.580> him

pipe here then he also I also had him

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.160 
pipe here then he also I also had him
build<00:03:20.030> me<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:22.490> can<00:03:22.700> see<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.840> glares

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
build me you can see that the glares

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.990 
build me you can see that the glares
again<00:03:24.590> horrible<00:03:25.780> what<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:27.710> put<00:03:27.980> in<00:03:28.220> probe

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
again horrible what you put in probe

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.110 
again horrible what you put in probe
holders<00:03:29.510> here<00:03:29.980> which<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.130> will<00:03:31.160> show<00:03:31.580> you

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.050 

so<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.750> can<00:03:37.930> see<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:39.040> those<00:03:39.700> are<00:03:39.940> the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
so you can see that there those are the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.059 
so you can see that there those are the
pro<00:03:40.270> holders<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.930> had<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.380> built<00:03:41.590> me<00:03:44.069> you

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
pro holders that I had and built me you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.530 
pro holders that I had and built me you
can<00:03:45.220> see<00:03:45.459> these<00:03:45.610> probably<00:03:46.030> better<00:03:46.270> now

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
can see these probably better now

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.050 
can see these probably better now
there's<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.170> pro<00:03:47.349> folders<00:03:47.830> which<00:03:48.220> are<00:03:48.400> always

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
there's the pro folders which are always

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.470 
there's the pro folders which are always
just<00:03:49.540> barely<00:03:50.020> under<00:03:50.560> water<00:03:50.800> now<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:52.000> filter

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
just barely under water now the filter

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.650 
just barely under water now the filter
Sox<00:03:52.900> like<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.349> said<00:03:53.620> are<00:03:53.910> completely<00:03:54.910> sealed<00:03:55.239> so

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
Sox like I said are completely sealed so

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.380 
Sox like I said are completely sealed so
you<00:03:56.260> can<00:03:56.470> see<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.890> water<00:03:57.099> has<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.459> go<00:03:57.849> over

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.900 

water<00:04:01.390> must<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:01.900> over<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.760> through<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
water must go over this through the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.460 
water must go over this through the
filter<00:04:04.269> Sox<00:04:04.769> down<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.160> through<00:04:06.819> here<00:04:07.239> now<00:04:08.110> if

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
filter Sox down and through here now if

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.170 
filter Sox down and through here now if
the<00:04:08.739> filter<00:04:09.040> Sox<00:04:09.280> work<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.700> get<00:04:09.880> clocked

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
the filter Sox work to get clocked

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.050 
the filter Sox work to get clocked
because<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.230> forgot<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> change<00:04:11.890> them<00:04:12.190> we<00:04:12.850> did

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
because I forgot to change them we did

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.400 
because I forgot to change them we did
put<00:04:13.269> cut<00:04:13.450> outs<00:04:13.600> here<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.380> water

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
put cut outs here so that the water

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.870 
put cut outs here so that the water
would<00:04:14.739> come<00:04:14.950> over<00:04:15.280> here<00:04:15.580> instead<00:04:15.790> of

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
would come over here instead of

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.420 
would come over here instead of
overflowing<00:04:16.510> onto<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.840> floor<00:04:17.109> now<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:17.919> get<00:04:18.280> to

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
overflowing onto the floor now to get to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.830 
overflowing onto the floor now to get to
the<00:04:18.459> filter<00:04:18.820> sock<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.359> they<00:04:19.479> are<00:04:19.540> still

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the filter sock so that they are still

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.390 
the filter sock so that they are still
quiet<00:04:20.139> we<00:04:20.410> put<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> tray<00:04:20.979> in<00:04:21.510> sorry<00:04:22.510> eyelid<00:04:22.870> in

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
quiet we put a tray in sorry eyelid in

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.490 
quiet we put a tray in sorry eyelid in
easily<00:04:24.400> removable<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.660> remove<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.050> Sox<00:04:26.320> put

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
easily removable to remove the Sox put

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.580 
easily removable to remove the Sox put
the<00:04:26.620> new<00:04:26.740> Sox<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.870> put<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:28.990> tray<00:04:29.200> right<00:04:29.410> back

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
the new Sox in put the tray right back

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.469 
the new Sox in put the tray right back
on<00:04:31.320> now<00:04:32.320> these<00:04:32.590> cutouts<00:04:32.889> here<00:04:33.490> where<00:04:34.389> the

the refugium was so that the water and
the<00:04:39.880> refugium<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.990> going<00:04:41.590> almost<00:04:41.890> through<00:04:42.280> the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
the refugium is going almost through the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.100 
the refugium is going almost through the
whole<00:04:42.550> section<00:04:43.000> instead<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.330> just<00:04:43.570> grazing

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
whole section instead of just grazing

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.560 
whole section instead of just grazing
over<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.440> top<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.940> there<00:04:46.090> are<00:04:46.180> few<00:04:46.330> gems

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
over the top so there are few gems
