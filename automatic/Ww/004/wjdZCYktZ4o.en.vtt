the our juni here comes in different

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.420 
the our juni here comes in different
layers<00:06:31.550> so<00:06:31.880> you<00:06:31.969> get<00:06:32.180> 14<00:06:32.690> and<00:06:32.990> 16<00:06:33.349> and<00:06:33.740> then<00:06:33.800> so

layers so you get 14 and 16 and then so

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.579

when<00:06:34.760> you're<00:06:34.880> braiding<00:06:35.180> it<00:06:35.510> doesn't<00:06:35.960> is<00:06:36.139> not<00:06:36.560> a

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
when you're braiding it doesn't is not a

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.070 
when you're braiding it doesn't is not a
smooth<00:06:37.039> but<00:06:37.849> you<00:06:38.089> could<00:06:38.270> do<00:06:38.360> fun<00:06:38.570> stuff<00:06:38.599> like

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
smooth but you could do fun stuff like

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.850 
smooth but you could do fun stuff like
that<00:06:39.110> with<00:06:39.469> this<00:06:39.589> hair

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
that with this hair

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.860 
that with this hair
since<00:06:40.069> it<00:06:40.219> lays<00:06:40.400> pretty<00:06:40.789> flat<00:06:41.120> so<00:06:41.479> that's

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
since it lays pretty flat so that's

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.610 
since it lays pretty flat so that's
another<00:06:42.139> positive<00:06:42.379> i<00:06:42.800> guess<00:06:43.300> but<00:06:44.379> so<00:06:45.379> that's

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
another positive i guess but so that's

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.830 
another positive i guess but so that's
