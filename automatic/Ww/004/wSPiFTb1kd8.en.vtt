one league going to the coil pack and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.300 
one league going to the coil pack and
then<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.200> course<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.880> four<00:05:27.880> other<00:05:29.100> leads<00:05:30.100> that

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
then of course the four other leads that

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.950 
then of course the four other leads that
go<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.970> spark<00:05:31.690> plugs<00:05:31.930> on<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.170> engine<00:05:32.790> but

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
go to the spark plugs on the engine but

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.690 
go to the spark plugs on the engine but
that's<00:05:34.960> pretty<00:05:35.140> good

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.360 

and<00:05:39.060> then<00:05:39.300> he's<00:05:39.750> got<00:05:39.960> well

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370
