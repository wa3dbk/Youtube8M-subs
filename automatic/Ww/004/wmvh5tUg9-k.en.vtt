00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.589 
and that you can all do it yourself it's
just<00:02:26.189> gonna<00:02:26.430> cost<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.909> bit<00:02:27.150> more<00:02:27.180> money

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
it's expensive help and that's why

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's expensive help and that's why
record<00:02:33.719> labels<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.109> be<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.469> really

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
record labels can be really really

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.080
