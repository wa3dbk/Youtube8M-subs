00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Profound Velocity presents a penalty junking tutorial 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 with hero 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Step 1 Circle Jump 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Look about 90 degrees away from your goal. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 ... in this case I move to the left. Now hold the left penalty key and the forward key while moving the mouse smoothly in the target direction. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 step 2 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 After your Circlejump was successful ... 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 ... continue to hold down the forward key and the left penalty key until you land again. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Step 3 Change sides 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 At this point, move the mouse to the right and press the right instead of the left penalty button. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 IMPORTANT: Do not release the Forward button while you are punishing. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 last step 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 From now on, you will repeat this movement by moving the mouse to the left and right while simultaneously pressing the left or right penalty button. As you continue and your speed increases, the angle between left and right must increase. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Punishing is easy to learn, but hard to master. Here's the rest of the video in slow motion and then at normal speed. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Now in full speed. Have fun! 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.800
 Good luck! You can always go back and pause the video if you've missed anything ...
