00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.090
 I would like to go into the police if requested 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.450
 In France 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.589
 New 35 hour labor system 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.749
 You can have a vacation for 5 to 8 weeks a year 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.009
 I can do it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.960
 In other words, work and life are compatible 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.500
 Because you should cope while injecting to the wife 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.310
 Because it is a life of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.189
 And I think there was a system to enjoy my time 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.939
 However 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 The big thing is that only Japanese people go to the end company and their time 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.540
 Opening time has increased more than opening time 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.190
 If you thought that such a situation should be corrected 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 Ascend to 3210 people because I think 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360
 It seems that he was Japanese 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 It has been really done 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.420
 It is to be a lot of Japanese 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420
 I'm a writer of kanji 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.030
 Non-regular This is 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.160
 Producer can 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 We prohibit reproduction without permission of Buzen city 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.660
 all 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 It was less than 6 degrees 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 I have no work 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 It is a flag 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.960
 the same 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.210
 I talked about it because I was working 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 Surprisingly 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.680
 Fishing is foreigner 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 Civil servant 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.290
 On the other hand, even outside the base 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.810
 big 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.190
 Hide forever 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.750
 things like this 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.330
 So beside the work of the US geology 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.690
 Of these people 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.320
 Sue with lukin 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.650
 With this 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.160
 It is a practical test part and 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.170
 Established some exploration and mining 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.680
 Politely perceivable shape 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.920
 It's bigger than it actually is 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.660
 It seems that 100 books 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.610
 inspire 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.800
 Maybe it's not me 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.430
 Corrective advice 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.780
 At least 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.349
 Nobuo Katogi No. 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.229
 Getting back time is a big deal 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.999
 I think that is the thing 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.269
 In terms of digital version, we camped in Japan 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.109
 Because I was turning the time banner 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.109
 Follow down 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.180
 I will ask Mr. Miyazaki at the time of thank you
