00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.319
 moment only that comes within this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.530

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.160
 the book sequences 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.459
 The look of love, right? I have to see in 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.750
 one that cocaine in the door is 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.459

 and here the book is the second volume of 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.470

 Wishing Merry Christmas and I found it very much. 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.450
 The cool part of the story is 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 this one receives at the beginning of December 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.320
 of the leya publisher who was the number 1 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:55.090
 what is the book or very good is this 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.080
 book is so involves science fiction 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.330
 with a lot of technology going on in the future 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.180
 and I loved the idea of ​​the author of the book if 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 to spend is in the video game is that you go 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.160
 follow a search and the whole world 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.860
 is connected to this search that will pass 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.510
 inside the jury is I thought I would not 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.930
 like the city is full 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.989
 I do not know if it would be so good but it was not 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.820
 genial the idea of ​​the author inactive since 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.930
 It's really good for me too. 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.970
 I guess not only fans of these things 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.739
 technology or games you'll like 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 of the chic book that many people can 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.799
 like very very good 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 I recommend that you read the 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.209
 review also receives from the publisher 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.660
 read the book beyond what I believe I know 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.730
 but no series is this book here is going to be 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.980
 a little more adult since we are 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.000
 on high now these adult novels 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.150
 then it's a texture thing I'm not 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.980
 What will an old book say to me? 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.060
 send because it was the launch of the month of 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.160
 December 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.049
 So I'll talk now, Jan arrived to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.959
 complete the letters by the publisher's label 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.209
 following the three books that were to 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.140
 Could it be such a lions hour? 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.560
 nickel 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.930
 he is the author of the series of adventures in 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 series and remained in that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.769
 Anahi is very cool, I really liked it 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.180
 very 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.780
 first to draw attention to this 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.520
 book was the cover that I found too much 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.860
 I like book cover so it's not over 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.009
 minister not actions with people and also 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.550
 piloted author of December inserts 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.350
 It's also a very cool book and it gave 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.720
 advice in the example was also 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.720
 in eleven and who he is an extract and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.080
 each chapter has has to be legal is 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.080
 area is very good is a juvenile throw 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.330
 more cool investigative even from 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:04.030
 a leader as an example of how history 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:08.470
 receive also the cosmic that is called me 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.259
 attention is for the title synopsis 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.220
 also by its cover quite liked the right 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:17.229
 books of the following publisher are 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.750
 more with the youth audience and I we 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.659
 in these books will be one of the next eight 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.360
 years of the institution and lastly 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:29.349
 Next story I received nothing to 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.930
 whenever it is a juvenile romance only 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.419
 more adult also only came back more 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.229
 For us we feel in pre adolescence and 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.930
 will joined the meeting preceding the 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.090
 That girls' nighttime story then 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.800
 I 'm going to give a life on the contract. 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:52.300
 the book is the story changes also the two 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.919
 killers of the next and book bótons 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.919
 What could be one of those? 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.289
 then what could be one of these is the 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.580
 first volume of a series only 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:09.849
 wrong questions or name of the school 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.880
 received the universe of books the book 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.280
 dark wish that is the symbol of the series 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.610
 Escape from the first book is the price of 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.490
 a book that is more 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.759
 we hear about 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.849
 Grané which are the virus is a little 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:28.270
 style black given image is just not 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.729
 it's so good against the black spot but 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.789
 let's see is the first volume was not 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:39.500
 So cool, let's beat the second 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.940
 volume gives an improvement and the other side 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.690
 The story I received was the biography. 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.009
 illustrated keys, I did not feel well 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.069
 placed to read this book 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.949
 Because I've been superfuckin ' 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:55.130
 child I believe there everyone 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:58.970
 had two keys and biographies that 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.000
 very good I 've been reading by boat is that 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.470
 I was very curious and he has several 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.560
 photos 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.229
 the key characters and chapolin I 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.979
 I think it's cool, I think it's a fan. 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.380
 even worth the Frida was right 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.720
 cool and today at the level that comes to me 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.030
 Talk about a purchase I made this 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.340
 Christmas to myself since no one in 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.650
 home give me gift books 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.469
 so I bought the sword storm 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.349
 which is the third book of the 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:33.050
 ice and fire, I was very excited 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:35.060
 to see if cheap American books and 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.219

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.620
 goal of reading one book per month in 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:40.460
 2013 I think I'll read in April if 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.990
 I'm not mistaken 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.630
 I'm really excited to start right away. 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.080
 because the previous book fury of kings 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.210
 so ended he knows the super curious 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.789

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:59.180
 two others and come on I'm sure 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.759
