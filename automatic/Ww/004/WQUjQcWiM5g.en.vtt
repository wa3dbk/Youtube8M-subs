00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.650
 hello while innate immunity is 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.040
 widespread in humans 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.230
 live adaptive and clean immunity 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.730
 to vertebrates 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 appeared there are only 400 million 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.520
 of years it adds to the immunity 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.859
 innate and ensures a specific action 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.539
 against molecules or part of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.050
 molecules belonging to pathogens 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.559
 ap antigens I propose to you 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.480
 discover the cellular actors and 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.480
 molecular of this acquired immunity 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.540
 let's start by discovering the different 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.960
 cells involved in immunity 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.110
 adaptive to start the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.629
 lymphocytes b which are cells to 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.930
 bourg core in circulation in the sense 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.119
 and the lifts these lymphocytes has on 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.839
 their plasma membrane of antibodies 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.309
 membrane there are also the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.380
 lymphocytes and that we already have 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.549
 encountered they are present in the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.310
 lymph nodes 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.370
 he owns on the surface of their 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 receptor membranes t must be 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.550
 distinguish two types of t lymphocytes 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.000
 cd4 t cells that has a 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.260
 cd4 marker and cd8 t cells 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.030
 who have cd markers fast he 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.460
 will differentiate afterwards in 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.590
 different cells the t lymphocytes 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.480
 cd8 differentiating fake sites t 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.020
 cytotoxic which are cells 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.700
 killing cd4 t lymphocytes 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.500
 will differentiate to the t lymphocytes 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.750
 auxiliaries who plays a very important role 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.690
 important in adaptive immunity 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.000
 finally the lymphocytes b 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 will differentiate up our sites which 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 are large cells that has a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 golgi apparatus and reticulum 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.880
 highly developed rough endoplasmic 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.100
 it's plasma cells have the ability to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.799
 produce soluble antibodies let's see 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.830
 now the important molecules of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.729
 this adaptive immunity at the level of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
 lymphocytes b 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.110
 we know that on their membrane there to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.650
 b receptors or antibodies 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.019
 membrane in detail these antibodies 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.739
 membrane are made up of four 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.860
 protein chains two heavy chains and 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:32.810
 of light oaks each of these chains 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.150
 has a constant part the same 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.909
 for all lymphocytes and a part 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.640
 variable at the lymphocyte level 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.790
 their membrane has tai receptors 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.079
 chi in detail are made up of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.629
 two protein chains with a part 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.160
 constant and a variable part the 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.470
 variable parts of each these 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.819
 receptors constitute the sites of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.760
 specific recognition of an antigen 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.410
 to finish the t helper lymphocytes 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.510
 will have the ability to release 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.430
 interleukins two who are 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.799
 chemical messengers of importance 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.799
 capital in adaptive immunity
