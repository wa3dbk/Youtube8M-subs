shot now if you remember my previous
video<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.700> actually<00:00:09.090> already<00:00:09.360> did<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> video

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
video I actually already did a video

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.660 
video I actually already did a video
review<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> snipers<00:00:10.740> edge<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.490> hung

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
review of the snipers edge and we hung

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.339 
review of the snipers edge and we hung
it<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.090> opening<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> my<00:00:12.630> two-car<00:00:13.080> garage

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it in the opening of my two-car garage

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
it in the opening of my two-car garage
it<00:00:14.099> worked<00:00:14.309> pretty<00:00:14.549> well<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.940> way<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it worked pretty well that way but I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.609 
it worked pretty well that way but I
didn't<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.690> quite<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.170> much<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
didn't like it quite as much because I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.380 
didn't like it quite as much because I
have<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> slope<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.520> my<00:00:17.760> driveway<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
have a slope on my driveway and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.300 
have a slope on my driveway and
basically<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.439> made<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:19.980> shooting

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
basically it made it so I was shooting

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
basically it made it so I was shooting
uphill<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.240> think<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.750> area<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.170> we've

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
uphill so I think this area that we've

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.750 
uphill so I think this area that we've
got<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.310> perfect

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
got it in now is going to be perfect

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.900 
got it in now is going to be perfect
this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> back<00:00:24.570> wall<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:25.050> basement

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
this is the back wall of my basement

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.849 
this is the back wall of my basement
plenty<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.000> width<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.859> definitely

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
plenty of width for it and definitely

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
plenty of width for it and definitely
plenty<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> height<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
plenty of height for it so I've got the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
plenty of height for it so I've got the
8<00:00:31.470> foot<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> think<00:00:32.130> we've<00:00:32.219> got<00:00:32.340> 8<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.730> half

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
8 foot I think we've got 8 and a half

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.900 
8 foot I think we've got 8 and a half
feet<00:00:32.880> ceilings<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:35.219> should<00:00:35.280> work

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
feet ceilings in here so it should work

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
feet ceilings in here so it should work
just<00:00:36.180> fine<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> 8<00:00:37.079> foot<00:00:37.320> snipers<00:00:37.770> edge

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
just fine up at the 8 foot snipers edge

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500 
just fine up at the 8 foot snipers edge
so<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.149> video<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so what I want to do in this video is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
so what I want to do in this video is
basically<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.559> show<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
basically just show you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
basically just show you
you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.520> pieces<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.540> I've

you know what pieces I'm using what I've

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.900 
you know what pieces I'm using what I've
picked<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> store<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:44.129> how<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
picked up at the store and then how it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.650 
picked up at the store and then how it
all<00:00:45.030> comes<00:00:45.239> together

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
all comes together

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
all comes together
I've<00:00:45.989> never<00:00:46.260> done<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.530> before<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.100> we're

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I've never done this before so we're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.040 
I've never done this before so we're
gonna<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.899> learn

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
gonna kind of go through this and learn

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
gonna kind of go through this and learn
together<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> snipers<00:00:50.940> edge

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
together but this is the snipers edge

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.430 
together but this is the snipers edge
I've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.510> rolled<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.110> but

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I've got it all rolled up right now but

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.889 
I've got it all rolled up right now but
you'll<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.879> full<00:00:54.360> effect<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.809> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you'll see it in in full effect as we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.270 
you'll see it in in full effect as we
get<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.030> 16<00:00:57.780> foot<00:00:58.079> 2x4<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
get going and this is a 16 foot 2x4 so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.930 
get going and this is a 16 foot 2x4 so
what<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> plan<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:01.399> screw<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> directly

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
what I plan to do is screw it directly

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.560 
what I plan to do is screw it directly
onto<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.830> 16<00:01:05.070> foot<00:01:05.189> 2x4<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.390> see

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
onto the the 16 foot 2x4 so you can see

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.080 
onto the the 16 foot 2x4 so you can see
we've<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.080> grommets<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
we've got these little grommets and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.039 
we've got these little grommets and
basically<00:01:09.090> we'll<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.540> washers

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
basically we'll just get some washers

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
basically we'll just get some washers
and<00:01:10.200> screws<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.860> fasten<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and screws and fasten it right to the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
and screws and fasten it right to the
2x4<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.500> I've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.770> four<00:01:14.159> ten<00:01:14.939> inch<00:01:15.119> two<00:01:15.360> by

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
2x4 then I've got four ten inch two by

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
2x4 then I've got four ten inch two by
fours<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.049> had<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.619> cut<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
fours I had them cut these down for I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
fours I had them cut these down for I
don't<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> chop<00:01:17.939> saw<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.390> hopefully<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
don't have a chop saw so hopefully the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160 
don't have a chop saw so hopefully the
measure<00:01:19.979> twice<00:01:20.250> cut<00:01:20.310> once<00:01:20.720> saying<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.990> work

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
measure twice cut once saying will work

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
measure twice cut once saying will work
for<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.280> had<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.270> cut<00:01:24.420> these

height<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:30.180> sure<00:01:30.329> we've<00:01:30.450> got<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
height and make sure we've got the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
height and make sure we've got the
proper<00:01:30.990> height<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> comes<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
proper height so that it comes just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.609 
proper height so that it comes just
barely<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> floor<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> hangs

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
barely down to the floor and hangs

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
barely down to the floor and hangs
properly<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.939> we've<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.420> screws<00:01:36.720> some

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
properly then we've got some screws some

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
properly then we've got some screws some
shorter<00:01:37.530> ones<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:37.920> longer<00:01:38.280> ones<00:01:38.310> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
shorter ones and some longer ones just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
shorter ones and some longer ones just
you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.070> used

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you know some of them are gonna be used

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
you know some of them are gonna be used
to<00:01:41.280> attach<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.390> snipers<00:01:43.229> edge<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
to attach the the snipers edge to the
2x4<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.189> some<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.729> used<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> attach<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
2x4 and some will be used to attach the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
2x4 and some will be used to attach the
two<00:01:45.810> by<00:01:45.930> force<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.380> each<00:01:46.500> other<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.430> different

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
two by force to each other so different

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870 
two by force to each other so different
sized<00:01:48.149> screws<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.500> drill<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.610> let's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
sized screws there and a drill so let's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
sized screws there and a drill so let's
go<00:01:51.000> ahead<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.509> set<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> camera

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
go ahead I'm going to set up the camera

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.410 
go ahead I'm going to set up the camera
and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.799> show<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> show<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:53.970> through<00:01:54.240> this

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.550 

okay<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:02.509> here's<00:02:02.750> what<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:02.899> got<00:02:03.049> now<00:02:03.229> we've<00:02:03.439> got

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
okay so here's what we got now we've got

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.339 
okay so here's what we got now we've got
the<00:02:04.130> four<00:02:04.430> 10-inch<00:02:04.850> two<00:02:05.210> by<00:02:05.360> fours<00:02:05.950> assembled

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
the four 10-inch two by fours assembled

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.320 
the four 10-inch two by fours assembled
basically<00:02:09.349> stuck<00:02:09.739> just<00:02:10.250> kind<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.030> spread<00:02:11.239> them

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
basically stuck just kind of spread them

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.440 
basically stuck just kind of spread them
out<00:02:11.450> across<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.230> length<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.489> 16-foot

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
out across the length of the 16-foot

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.330 
out across the length of the 16-foot
two-by-four<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.800> see<00:02:15.890> I've<00:02:15.980> got<00:02:16.130> two

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
two-by-four you can see I've got two

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.570 
two-by-four you can see I've got two
screws<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.790> each<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.739> then<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.099> idea<00:02:19.400> is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
screws in each one and then the idea is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.449 
screws in each one and then the idea is
we'll<00:02:19.790> adjust<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.620> hang<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.769> by<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.980> ceiling

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
we'll adjust and hang it by the ceiling

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.920 
we'll adjust and hang it by the ceiling
or<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.450> ceiling

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
or to the ceiling

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.540 
or to the ceiling
by<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.099> top<00:02:25.310> pieces<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:28.069> he

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
by these top pieces on so that's it he

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.000 
by these top pieces on so that's it he
said<00:02:28.910> had<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.380> small<00:02:30.380> issue<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.860> one

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
said had a small issue with the one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.520 
said had a small issue with the one
screw<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.489> ended<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:31.760> stripping<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.540> I'm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
screw I ended up stripping it so I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.020 
screw I ended up stripping it so I'm
thinking<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:33.980> gonna<00:02:34.160> leave<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.430> doesn't

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
thinking I'm just gonna leave it doesn't

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.199 
thinking I'm just gonna leave it doesn't
have<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.299> pretty<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.670> put<00:02:37.850> one<00:02:37.940> beside

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
it so let's go ahead and get this thing

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:49.130 
it so let's go ahead and get this thing
hung<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.130> now

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:42.870 

Oh

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.270 

all<00:03:43.880> right<00:03:44.150> all<00:03:44.780> done<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.710> was<00:03:45.890> actually<00:03:46.250> a

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
all right all done that was actually a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.070 
all right all done that was actually a
lot<00:03:46.430> harder<00:03:46.670> than<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.180> thought<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.870> was<00:03:47.930> gonna

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
lot harder than I thought it was gonna

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.220 
lot harder than I thought it was gonna
be<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.830> think<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.610> biggest<00:03:49.910> problem<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.660> I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
be I think the biggest problem is that I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.700 
be I think the biggest problem is that I
was<00:03:51.560> using<00:03:51.710> screws<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.520> these<00:03:53.290> if<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.440> decide

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
was using screws on these if you decide

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.440 
was using screws on these if you decide
to<00:03:54.740> do<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:55.190> way<00:03:55.370> yourself<00:03:55.820> do<00:03:56.120> yourself<00:03:56.420> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
to do it this way yourself do yourself a

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.170 
to do it this way yourself do yourself a
favor<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.430> rent<00:03:58.430> yourself<00:03:58.520> or<00:03:58.970> borrow

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
this is just kind of looking from the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.370 
this is just kind of looking from the
ground<00:04:03.710> up<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:05.030> do<00:04:05.270> like<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.870> know<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.110> kind<00:04:06.350> of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
got to go screws into the main two by

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.900 
got to go screws into the main two by
four<00:04:08.600> so<00:04:09.410> screws<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.010> washers<00:04:10.160> there<00:04:10.610> that's

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
four so screws and washers there that's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.250 
four so screws and washers there that's
that's<00:04:11.150> why<00:04:11.420> I'm<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.660> did<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> trick

drill and I kept stripping the heads of
my<00:04:19.970> screws<00:04:20.270> so<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:20.959> got<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.290> min<00:04:21.620> at<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.920> end<00:04:22.040> of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
my screws so I got a min at the end of

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.730 
my screws so I got a min at the end of
the<00:04:22.190> day<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.640> there's<00:04:23.330> eight<00:04:23.840> screws<00:04:24.260> total

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the day and there's eight screws total

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.380 
the day and there's eight screws total
four<00:04:25.580> different<00:04:25.880> studs<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:27.710> holding<00:04:28.390> but

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
four different studs so it's holding but

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.310 
four different studs so it's holding but
I<00:04:29.420> think<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.660> would<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:29.810> been<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.960> lot<00:04:30.170> easier

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
I think it would have been a lot easier

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.990 
I think it would have been a lot easier
with<00:04:30.980> just<00:04:31.010> count<00:04:31.460> them<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.670> with<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.850> quick

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
with just count them in with a quick

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.930 
with just count them in with a quick
nail<00:04:32.210> gun<00:04:32.500> both<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.740> front<00:04:33.950> side<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.610> you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
nail gun both on the front side and you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.310 
nail gun both on the front side and you
can<00:04:35.060> kind<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.240> see<00:04:35.390> on<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.570> backside<00:04:36.020> here<00:04:36.050> too

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
can kind of see on the backside here too

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.620 
can kind of see on the backside here too
so<00:04:37.070> nail<00:04:37.430> em<00:04:37.640> nail<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:38.030> two<00:04:38.150> two<00:04:38.270> by<00:04:38.390> fours

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so nail em nail the two two by fours

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.330 
so nail em nail the two two by fours
together<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.140> then<00:04:39.470> nail<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.890> two<00:04:40.010> by<00:04:40.100> fours

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
together and then nail the two by fours

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.680 
together and then nail the two by fours
to<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.930> rafters<00:04:41.930> but<00:04:42.410> good<00:04:43.310> news<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:43.970> my

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
to the rafters but good news is is my

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.210 
to the rafters but good news is is my
measurements<00:04:45.110> all<00:04:45.200> turned<00:04:45.440> out<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.860> perfect

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
measurements all turned out just perfect

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.100 
measurements all turned out just perfect
so<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.760> can<00:04:46.880> see<00:04:47.090> we're<00:04:47.300> just<00:04:47.450> right<00:04:47.840> on<00:04:48.080> the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
so you can see we're just right on the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.890 
so you can see we're just right on the
right<00:04:48.740> on<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.010> floor<00:04:49.250> there<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:50.390> comes<00:04:50.600> up<00:04:50.780> a

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
right on the floor there it comes up a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.750 
right on the floor there it comes up a
tiny<00:04:51.110> bit<00:04:51.290> at<00:04:51.530> this<00:04:51.710> end<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.250> that's<00:04:52.520> just

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
tiny bit at this end and that's just

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.240 
tiny bit at this end and that's just
because<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.990> put<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.320> wooden<00:04:54.710> dowel<00:04:54.920> in<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
because we put that wooden dowel in the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.770 
because we put that wooden dowel in the
bottom<00:04:55.520> here<00:04:55.700> you<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.240> see<00:04:56.330> there's<00:04:56.690> that

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
bottom here you can see there's that

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.840 
bottom here you can see there's that
little<00:04:56.930> hole<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.590> my<00:04:58.160> wooden<00:04:58.340> dowel<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:58.820> a

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
little hole and my wooden dowel is a

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.300 
little hole and my wooden dowel is a
tiny<00:04:59.180> bit<00:04:59.270> warped<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.950> wooden<00:05:01.190> dowel

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
tiny bit warped so the wooden dowel

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.660 
tiny bit warped so the wooden dowel
curves<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.210> there<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.400> kind<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.430> near<00:05:04.580> the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
curves up there that kind of near the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.130 
curves up there that kind of near the
end<00:05:04.790> there<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.300> that's<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.690> only<00:05:05.810> reason<00:05:05.900> why

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
end there so that's the only reason why

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.720 
end there so that's the only reason why
it's<00:05:06.230> popping<00:05:06.470> up<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.590> little<00:05:06.710> bit<00:05:06.860> there<00:05:06.980> but

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
it's popping up a little bit there but

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
it's popping up a little bit there but
all<00:05:07.970> in<00:05:08.180> all<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:09.340> fantastic<00:05:10.340> setup<00:05:10.750> I'm

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
all in all it's a fantastic setup I'm

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.340 
all in all it's a fantastic setup I'm
happy<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.230> it<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:13.090> gonna<00:05:14.140> start<00:05:15.140> taking

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
happy with it and gonna start taking

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.490 
happy with it and gonna start taking
some<00:05:15.410> shots<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:15.860> we'll<00:05:16.490> see<00:05:16.640> how<00:05:16.730> it<00:05:16.820> goes

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
some shots so we'll see how it goes

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.570 
some shots so we'll see how it goes
okay<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.560> here's<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.830> snipers<00:05:19.250> edge<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.460> looks

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
okay so here's the snipers edge it looks

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.710 
okay so here's the snipers edge it looks
like<00:05:19.670> all<00:05:19.850> set<00:05:20.060> up<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.420> can<00:05:20.510> see<00:05:20.600> you've

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
like all set up as you can see you've

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.540 
like all set up as you can see you've
got<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.870> five<00:05:21.110> holes<00:05:21.470> cut<00:05:21.740> out<00:05:21.770> now<00:05:22.100> those

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
got the five holes cut out now those

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.190 
got the five holes cut out now those
actually<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:22.940> tarp<00:05:23.390> behind<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.110> it's

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
actually have tarp behind it so it's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.260 
actually have tarp behind it so it's
almost<00:05:24.320> like<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.530> pocket<00:05:25.040> so<00:05:25.460> what<00:05:25.700> happens<00:05:26.090> is

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
almost like a pocket so what happens is

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.290 
almost like a pocket so what happens is
if<00:05:26.480> you<00:05:26.600> hit<00:05:26.870> one<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.200> holes<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.970> can<00:05:29.090> see

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
if you hit one of the holes you can see

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.240 
if you hit one of the holes you can see
how<00:05:29.450> it<00:05:29.570> drops<00:05:29.810> in<00:05:30.110> falls<00:05:30.470> down<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.890> bottom

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
how it drops in falls down to the bottom

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.890 
how it drops in falls down to the bottom
and<00:05:31.400> then<00:05:31.760> that<00:05:31.850> makes<00:05:32.030> gathering<00:05:32.570> them<00:05:32.690> up<00:05:32.780> a

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
and then that makes gathering them up a

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.360 
and then that makes gathering them up a
lot<00:05:33.050> easier<00:05:33.440> as<00:05:33.560> long<00:05:33.710> as<00:05:33.830> you're<00:05:34.010> hitting

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
lot easier as long as you're hitting

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.000 
lot easier as long as you're hitting
them<00:05:34.610> accurately<00:05:34.970> right<00:05:35.290> this<00:05:36.290> is<00:05:36.440> a<00:05:36.470> really

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
them accurately right this is a really

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.970 
them accurately right this is a really
good<00:05:37.220> setup<00:05:37.550> for<00:05:37.700> indoor<00:05:38.240> use<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:39.740> reason

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
good setup for indoor use and the reason

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.260 
good setup for indoor use and the reason
why<00:05:40.070> is<00:05:40.130> because<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.520> hits<00:05:40.760> with<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:40.970> dead

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
why is because it hits with a dead

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.540 
why is because it hits with a dead
bounce<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:41.960> as<00:05:42.050> you<00:05:42.110> can<00:05:42.200> see<00:05:42.260> if<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.280> miss

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
bounce so as you can see if you miss

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.490 
bounce so as you can see if you miss
just<00:05:44.000> drop<00:05:44.210> straight<00:05:44.390> down<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:45.350> you're<00:05:45.440> not

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
just drop straight down so you're not

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.750 
just drop straight down so you're not
gonna<00:05:45.620> be<00:05:45.740> shagging<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.220> lot<00:05:46.340> of<00:05:46.430> pucks<00:05:46.640> it's

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
gonna be shagging a lot of pucks it's

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.100 
gonna be shagging a lot of pucks it's
not<00:05:46.880> going<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.060> ricochet<00:05:47.420> off<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.900> hit<00:05:47.990> the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
not going to ricochet off and hit the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.230 
not going to ricochet off and hit the
window<00:05:48.470> or<00:05:48.650> hit<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> light<00:05:49.040> bulb<00:05:49.310> or<00:05:49.550> whatever

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
window or hit the light bulb or whatever

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.030 
window or hit the light bulb or whatever
else<00:05:50.479> it's<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.810> real<00:05:50.960> dead<00:05:51.140> bounce<00:05:51.350> makes<00:05:51.890> it

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
else it's the real dead bounce makes it

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.760 
else it's the real dead bounce makes it
really<00:05:52.220> indoor<00:05:52.880> friendly<00:05:53.390> now<00:05:54.229> obviously
