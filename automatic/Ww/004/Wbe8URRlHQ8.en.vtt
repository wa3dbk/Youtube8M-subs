 they are kept within a comfort zone in which they remain 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.019
 Without moving

 because you have three ways to get away from these near community you can 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.110
 reviewing positive affirmations

 to reaffirm that you already have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 creating positive images

 simply changing the way you act 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.960
 let it be stagnant

 if he keeps thinking acting as speaking, he will always be living the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.320
 same experiences 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.439
 that will stay stagnant and my uncle in a vicious circle 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.710
 as we have seen several times before 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.819
 our thoughts turn images 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.749
 the terminal 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.670
 our way of acting 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 if you are constantly thinking 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 and consequently generating bajit situation is limiting 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 you're just going to find it's obvious 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.809
 if you're thinking what if you call that person 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.079

 your thoughts stimulate that same 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.050
 without anger the fear and then that

 tiara enter 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.829
 in a negative way 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.560
 and really will be rejected by that force 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 reaffirming your initial thought 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.279

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.389
 current negative 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.959
 Successful people are very clear about this 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.090
 they try to be almost never and press and act according to reality 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.009
 what 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.249
 she says 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.819
 that way they focus their mind's attention 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.789
 in your goal 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.459
 which internal weapon 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.319
 we all have our community which is delimited by the image that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.049
 we have of ourselves 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.089

 within the communal power 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.850
 I imagine that many times 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.939
 now you hear stories of people winning the lottery 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.519
 and squander the money a little time 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.459
 This is because 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.169
 here they did not feel comfortable with that purpose 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.299
 because the image that they had to themselves 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.060
 he did not adjust for having all that money in his life 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.739
