00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
smart to go with a semi conservative

tune<00:05:03.639> right<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.979> since<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.430> cars<00:05:06.960> capable<00:05:07.960> of

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050

more<00:05:08.259> than<00:05:08.440> what<00:05:08.680> he<00:05:08.889> tuned<00:05:09.099> to<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.900> I'll

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
more than what he tuned to that so I'll

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.689
