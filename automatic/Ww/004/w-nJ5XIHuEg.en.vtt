to<00:02:49.549> go<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.150> see<00:02:50.299> in<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:51.019> movie<00:02:51.140> theater<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:51.650> at

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
to go and see in a movie theater but at

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.039 
to go and see in a movie theater but at
the<00:02:51.890> same<00:02:52.130> time<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.720> much<00:02:53.900> more

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
the same time it's much more

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.660 
the same time it's much more
thought-provoking<00:02:54.470> than<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.310> think<00:02:55.549> it's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
thought-provoking than that I think it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.240 
thought-provoking than that I think it's
so<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.750> more<00:02:56.959> sophisticated<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
so it's it's it's more sophisticated and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.470 
so it's it's it's more sophisticated and
I<00:02:58.340> think<00:02:58.370> when<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> put<00:02:58.970> those<00:02:59.120> two<00:02:59.360> together

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
I think when you put those two together

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.300 
I think when you put those two together
I<00:03:00.019> think<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.950> be<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> much<00:03:01.280> more

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
I think it's going to be a much more

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:13.470 
I think it's going to be a much more
satisfying<00:03:02.030> motion<00:03:02.720> picture<00:03:03.019> experience

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.540
