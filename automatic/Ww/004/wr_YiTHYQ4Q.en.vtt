always been fun and if you look at the
field<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:26.110> probably<00:01:26.500> one<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.280> better

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
field it's probably one of the better

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.100 
field it's probably one of the better
fields<00:01:27.790> in<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.939> league<00:01:28.090> right<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.750> MLS

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
fields in the league right in the MLS

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.770 
fields in the league right in the MLS
right<00:01:29.320> now<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:30.150> definitely<00:01:31.150> feels<00:01:31.420> gonna<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.750> a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
right now so definitely feels gonna be a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.510 
right now so definitely feels gonna be a
lot<00:01:31.960> better<00:01:32.110> it'll<00:01:32.920> certainly<00:01:33.130> be<00:01:33.369> a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
lot better it'll certainly be a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.359 
lot better it'll certainly be a
different<00:01:34.090> experience<00:01:34.119> playing<00:01:34.900> here<00:01:35.369> versus

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
different experience playing here versus

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.030 
different experience playing here versus
in<00:01:36.490> Cuba<00:01:36.939> I'm<00:01:37.470> expecting<00:01:38.470> at<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.619> minimum<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
in Cuba I'm expecting at a minimum the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.999 
in Cuba I'm expecting at a minimum the
lighting<00:01:39.490> will<00:01:39.640> be<00:01:39.820> sufficient<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
lighting will be sufficient here the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.690 
lighting will be sufficient here the
field<00:01:42.310> obviously<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.720> great<00:01:44.049> shape<00:01:44.079> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
field obviously is in in great shape so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780 
field obviously is in in great shape so
we're<00:01:45.700> hoping<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.829> little<00:01:48.460> bit<00:01:48.579> of<00:01:48.700> a
