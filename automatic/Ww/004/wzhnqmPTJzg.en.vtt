00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dots you could use stripes I'm all show

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
dots you could use stripes I'm all show
you<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.350> examples<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.100> different

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you some examples with some different

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
you some examples with some different
stripes<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.820> Chevron's<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.570> used<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
stripes and Chevron's that I used and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
stripes and Chevron's that I used and
once<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> end<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.409> will

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
once you get to the end you will

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
once you get to the end you will
probably<00:01:37.710> need<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.070> extra<00:01:38.400> dot<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.729> glue<00:01:38.759> there

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
probably need an extra dot of glue there

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
probably need an extra dot of glue there
just<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> hold<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:42.950> don't<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.159> too<00:01:44.340> much

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
just to hold it down don't get too much

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.679 
just to hold it down don't get too much
I'm<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:44.970> spreading<00:01:45.270> around<00:01:45.420> one

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I'm just kind of spreading around one

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
I'm just kind of spreading around one
little<00:01:45.869> dot<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.680> hold<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.100> second

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
little dot and just hold it for a second

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
little dot and just hold it for a second
while<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> dries<00:01:47.850> isn't<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.299> cool<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.259> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
while it dries isn't that cool you can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
while it dries isn't that cool you can
pull<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:51.000> chopstick<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:53.540> just

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
pull the chopstick out of there just

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.859 
pull the chopstick out of there just
like<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> paper

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
like that and there you have the paper

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240 
like that and there you have the paper
straw<00:01:58.229> alright

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
straw alright

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.679 
straw alright
but<00:01:59.549> now<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.180> notice<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.509> these

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
but now you'll notice you have these

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.789 
but now you'll notice you have these
will<00:02:00.810> point<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> ends<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
will point the ends here so what you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
will point the ends here so what you
want<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.689> trim<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.310> each<00:02:05.310> end<00:02:05.719> now<00:02:06.719> if

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
want to do is trim it on each end now if

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.999 
want to do is trim it on each end now if
you're<00:02:06.899> doing<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.170> bunch<00:02:07.320> together<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.920> might

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you're doing a bunch together you might

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
you're doing a bunch together you might
just<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.819> once<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
just want to do them all at once so you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.270 
just want to do them all at once so you
get<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> same<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.190> make

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
get the same you know so you can make

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
get the same you know so you can make
them<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.760> length<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.840> these

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
them all the same length so like these

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.150 
them all the same length so like these
are<00:02:13.110> probably<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.440> little<00:02:13.739> bigger

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
are probably a little bigger

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.110 
are probably a little bigger
all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> same<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.640> thought<00:02:14.820> he's<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
all the same we thought he's kind of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.990 
all the same we thought he's kind of
quickly<00:02:15.810> trim<00:02:16.020> them<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.350> um<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
quickly trim them out um but there you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.660 
quickly trim them out um but there you
can<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:18.240> all<00:02:18.450> about<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> same<00:02:18.960> length<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
can I'm all about the same length or you

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.460 
can I'm all about the same length or you
can<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:20.970> mismatched<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.960> guess<00:02:22.110> what's<00:02:22.290> where

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
can I'm mismatched I guess what's where

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.050 
can I'm mismatched I guess what's where
the<00:02:22.560> term<00:02:22.740> drawing<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> short<00:02:23.520> straw<00:02:23.790> comes

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the term drawing the short straw comes

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.160 
the term drawing the short straw comes
from<00:02:24.270> because<00:02:24.390> probably<00:02:24.600> all<00:02:24.810> straws<00:02:25.050> were

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
from because probably all straws were

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.750 
from because probably all straws were
made<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.530> back<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> day<00:02:25.950> alright

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
made like this back in the day alright

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.430 
made like this back in the day alright

cutting mat over and just slide

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.730

for more like me you'll wanna or a few

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.610 
for more like me you'll wanna or a few
of<00:03:03.300> those<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> wax<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.320> some<00:03:04.500> other

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
of those like the wax and some other

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.200 
of those like the wax and some other
sort<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.890> wax<00:03:05.070> melter<00:03:05.490> you'll<00:03:05.880> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> wipe

off<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> excess<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.020> cuz<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:07.320> going

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
off the excess just cuz it's not going

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.500 
off the excess just cuz it's not going
to<00:03:07.590> absorb<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.010> quite<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.370> well<00:03:08.520> but<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:09.300> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
to absorb in quite as well but there you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.600 
to absorb in quite as well but there you
have<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.140> waxed<00:03:10.800> straw<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.400> see

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
have it a waxed straw so you can see

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.880 
have it a waxed straw so you can see
that<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.880> does<00:03:12.090> change<00:03:12.600> well<00:03:13.170> Shelly<00:03:13.470> I'll<00:03:13.770> do

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
that it does change well Shelly I'll do

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.350 
that it does change well Shelly I'll do
one<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.160> these<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.970> can<00:03:15.120> see<00:03:15.300> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
one of these so you can see the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.550 
one of these so you can see the
difference<00:03:15.630> between<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.050> wax<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
difference between the wax and the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
difference between the wax and the
unwaxed<00:03:16.860> in<00:03:17.340> color<00:03:17.850> because<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.180> does<00:03:18.300> make

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
unwaxed in color because it does make

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.210 
unwaxed in color because it does make
the<00:03:18.630> paper<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:19.050> bit<00:03:19.200> more<00:03:19.470> transparent

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the paper a little bit more transparent

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640 
the paper a little bit more transparent
and<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.300> little<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.140> whites<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
and a little bit the the whites just

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.520 
and a little bit the the whites just
aren't<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.040> white<00:03:23.250> afterwards<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.450> um<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.440> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
aren't as white afterwards but um so you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.990 
aren't as white afterwards but um so you
can<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.740> up<00:03:25.830> side<00:03:26.040> by<00:03:26.160> side<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.760> little

can see up side by side it's a little

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.480 
can see up side by side it's a little
bit<00:03:27.120> darker<00:03:27.990> but<00:03:28.470> still<00:03:28.770> it's<00:03:28.980> super<00:03:29.310> cool<00:03:29.459> and
