 Quickly showing how it is created 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 It's first, you have to have a rule. 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.730
 You have to have this program that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 come here on hamachi will network create a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.969
