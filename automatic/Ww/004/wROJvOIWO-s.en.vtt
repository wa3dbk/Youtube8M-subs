iPhone or an Android device it lets us

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.840 
iPhone or an Android device it lets us
access<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> our<00:00:16.529> unified<00:00:17.100> communication

features<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.480> act<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.590> were<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
features and act as if we were in the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.910 
features and act as if we were in the
office<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.000> example<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:22.410> update<00:00:22.710> my

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
office so for example I can update my

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
office so for example I can update my
present<00:00:23.460> status<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.090> share<00:00:24.750> that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
present status and share that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
information with everybody on the system

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439 
information with everybody on the system
so<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:28.019> know<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.460> best<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> contact<00:00:30.300> me

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
even though I'm out and about so I put

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
even though I'm out and about so I put
myself<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.680> meeting<00:00:35.250> status<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:36.690> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what that has done is it adjusted the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
what that has done is it adjusted the
way<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.239> calls<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.660> routed<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.559> for

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
way that my calls are routed so for

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
way that my calls are routed so for
example<00:00:44.160> whilst<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.789> meeting

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
example whilst I was in a meeting

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.700 
example whilst I was in a meeting

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
they would have received the appropriate

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.180 
they would have received the appropriate
voicemail<00:00:47.460> greeting<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.170> can<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
voicemail greeting I can also see the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
voicemail greeting I can also see the
status<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.270> colleagues<00:00:51.660> back<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> the

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.959 

so<00:01:55.929> here<00:01:56.170> for<00:01:56.289> example<00:01:56.380> we<00:01:57.189> can<00:01:57.369> quickly<00:01:57.609> put<00:01:57.939> a

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
so here for example we can quickly put a

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.029 
so here for example we can quickly put a
call<00:01:58.240> through<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.689> Manfred<00:01:59.380> so<00:01:59.560> if<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.770> select

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
call through to Manfred so if I select

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.399 
call through to Manfred so if I select
Manfred<00:02:00.640> select<00:02:01.299> his<00:02:01.479> extension<00:02:01.899> number

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
Manfred select his extension number

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.130 
Manfred select his extension number
it'll<00:02:03.219> call<00:02:03.640> him<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.810> get<00:02:04.990> information

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
it'll call him and I get information

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.830 
it'll call him and I get information
back<00:02:05.829> on<00:02:05.859> my<00:02:06.219> mobile<00:02:06.490> phone<00:02:06.729> about<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.539> call

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
back on my mobile phone about that call

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.380 
back on my mobile phone about that call
so<00:02:08.830> for<00:02:09.039> example<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.149> really

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
so for example and this is really

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.270 
so for example and this is really
different<00:02:10.720> from<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.170> standard<00:02:11.680> way<00:02:11.799> you'd<00:02:12.010> use

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
different from a standard way you'd use

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.180 
different from a standard way you'd use
a<00:02:12.310> mobile<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.569> now<00:02:13.780> want<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.140> carry<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.160> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
a mobile if I now want to carry out a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.210 
a mobile if I now want to carry out a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
consultation and speak to somebody else

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
consultation and speak to somebody else
then<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.790> put<00:02:19.000> Manfred<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.569> hold<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.019> do

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
then I can put Manfred on hold and do

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.050 
then I can put Manfred on hold and do
that<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.760> once<00:02:24.970> I'm<00:02:25.180> speaking<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.900> Gary<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:27.060> can
