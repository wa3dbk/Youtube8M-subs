00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
lot about car parts but I was a little

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.209 
lot about car parts but I was a little
bit<00:00:39.930> amazed<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.440> opened<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.010> saw

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to look this good these are made out of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.160 
to look this good these are made out of
full<00:00:46.469> CNC<00:00:47.129> billet<00:00:47.730> aluminum<00:00:48.300> incredibly

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
full CNC billet aluminum incredibly

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
full CNC billet aluminum incredibly
strong<00:00:49.500> incredibly<00:00:50.219> lightweight<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
strong incredibly lightweight all the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000 
strong incredibly lightweight all the
hardware<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.289> ARP

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
hardware on them is actually ARP

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
hardware on them is actually ARP
supplied<00:00:53.430> hardware<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.870> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
supplied hardware again going for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110

strength<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.610> overkill<00:00:57.059> on

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
strength kind a little bit overkill on

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
strength kind a little bit overkill on
these<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> mean<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:57.870> talking<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.230> cam

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
these but I mean we're talking about cam

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.639 
these but I mean we're talking about cam
gears<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> guess<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.530> never

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
gears so you know I guess you can never

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.840 
gears so you know I guess you can never
have<00:01:01.859> too<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.699> their

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
have too much I think is their

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
have too much I think is their
philosophy<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> works<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
philosophy I don't know but it works and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
philosophy I don't know but it works and
it<00:01:05.010> works<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.000> love<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> colors

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I don't know if the camera truly does it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
I don't know if the camera truly does it
justice<00:01:52.970> again<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.150> looking<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.540> everything

things<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.260> really<00:02:01.260> can't<00:02:01.470> say<00:02:01.619> enough<00:02:01.650> good

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
things I really can't say enough good

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.520 
things I really can't say enough good
things<00:02:02.159> about<00:02:02.460> them<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.900> enough<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.380> they

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
things about them but enough of how they

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.240 
things about them but enough of how they
look<00:02:05.520> let's<00:02:05.970> talk<00:02:06.090> about<00:02:06.150> how<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:06.450> work<00:02:06.690> so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
look let's talk about how they work so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
look let's talk about how they work so
what<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.630> may<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.810> wondering

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
what these are for you may be wondering

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.870 
what these are for you may be wondering
why<00:02:10.289> we've<00:02:10.440> got<00:02:10.619> canned<00:02:10.979> years<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.790> know

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
why we've got canned years with you know

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.070 
why we've got canned years with you know
different<00:02:12.090> bolts<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.660> them<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.870> stuff<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
different bolts in them and stuff like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
different bolts in them and stuff like
that<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.420> when

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that so what you can actually do is when

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.059 
that so what you can actually do is when
you're<00:02:15.959> wanting<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.319> change<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> timing<00:02:16.890> on

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
you're wanting to change the timing on

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 
you're wanting to change the timing on
your<00:02:17.190> motor<00:02:17.370> without<00:02:18.000> having<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.720> physically

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
your motor without having to physically

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.900 
your motor without having to physically
take<00:02:19.530> apart<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> motor<00:02:20.190> take<00:02:20.400> off<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> time

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
take apart the motor take off the time

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.800 
take apart the motor take off the time
belt<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:22.620> into<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.160> motor<00:02:23.340> basically<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.660> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
belt go into the motor basically you can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
belt go into the motor basically you can
just<00:02:24.840> adjust<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.620> through<00:02:25.860> these<00:02:26.070> now<00:02:26.459> grant

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
just adjust it through these now grant

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.860 
just adjust it through these now grant
of<00:02:26.820> course<00:02:27.030> because<00:02:27.269> we<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.480> four<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.810> them

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
of course because we have four of them

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.180 
of course because we have four of them
it<00:02:28.019> makes<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.350> little<00:02:28.440> bit<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.739> difficult

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
it makes it a little bit more difficult

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.600 
it makes it a little bit more difficult
but<00:02:29.640> again<00:02:29.760> much<00:02:30.420> much<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:31.230> easier<00:02:31.459> than<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
but again much much much easier than the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.490 
but again much much much easier than the
alternate<00:02:32.970> methods<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
alternate methods so we're just going to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160 
alternate methods so we're just going to
loosen<00:02:34.680> these<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.330> turn<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> cap<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.019> can

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
loosen these up turn the cap and we can

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.650 
loosen these up turn the cap and we can
advance<00:02:38.010> or<00:02:38.310> retard<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.880> ignition<00:02:39.269> or<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
advance or retard the ignition or the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.300 
advance or retard the ignition or the
timing<00:02:39.900> okay

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
timing okay

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
timing okay
tighten<00:02:41.790> them<00:02:41.880> back<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.420> you're<00:02:42.810> ready<00:02:42.989> to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
tighten them back up and you're ready to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.270 
tighten them back up and you're ready to
go<00:02:43.290> very<00:02:43.920> simple<00:02:44.280> easy<00:02:44.730> adjustments<00:02:46.280> works

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
go very simple easy adjustments works
