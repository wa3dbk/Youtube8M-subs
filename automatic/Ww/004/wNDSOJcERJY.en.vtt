00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.990
 terms like the following video os 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.000
 I explain how to prepare a delicious 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 Chantilly cream ideal for covering 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 fill in biscuits here you have the video 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.640
 to prepare a cream 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.340
 500 milliliters of tonic 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 a teaspoon of vanilla essence and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.660
 50 grams of sugar back 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.870
 Well, the first thing we will do to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.059
 prepare that cream will add the cream 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.199
 in a bowl the goal has to be 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.520
 mentally cold 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.989
 just like the cream that we have 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.420
 introduced from the fridge a few hours 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.260
 before it's cool so 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.260
 we add 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.700
 and we started to beat 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.700
 at medium speed 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.179
 [Applause] 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.450
 well then when we see that it starts to 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 catch some consistency let's go 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.010
 add sugar and more 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 and we keep beating 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.819
 [Music] 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.380
 Well now that I was a little 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.860
 thicker is the time to add the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.800
 vanilla essence 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.690
 you can analyze another type of essence 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.480
 but the vanilla one because the truth is that 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.800
 It looks great but as I always say 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.350
 Well, all this taste 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.580
 we add 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.580
 vanilla grace 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 until a dough forms 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.710
 completely express 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.160
 Well, as you can see, I already have a view 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.290
 cream as you see has a consistency 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.530
 very thick is this consistency is the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.700
 ideal does not have to be neither more liquid nor 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.350
 harder and very carefully when 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.830
 when you are already seeing that the dough 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.110
 it's thick because you bat too 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.550
 can be cut and left as butter 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.950
 and then you're going to have it 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.220
 experiences because now you can go back 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.850
 so when you see that it expresses 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.500
 is waiting 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.720
 As you can see, they know how they are and we continue 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.000
 little by little this cream can you 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.940
 use at the moment or if not then in 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 the fridge so it does not become liquid 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.380
 because out of the fridge because no 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.960
 endure vale is ideal to decorate as 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.650
