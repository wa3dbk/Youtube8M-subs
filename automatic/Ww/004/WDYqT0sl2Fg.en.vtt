00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
see what the other lens i was looking at

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
see what the other lens i was looking at
was<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.570> canon<00:01:25.140> 70-200<00:01:27.020> with<00:01:28.549> us<00:01:29.549> em<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
was the canon 70-200 with us em the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.670 
was the canon 70-200 with us em the
70-200<00:01:32.280> USM<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.860> 600<00:01:36.530> but<00:01:37.530> it's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
70-200 USM is I think it's 600 but it's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.969 
70-200 USM is I think it's 600 but it's
f4<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.570> wasn't<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:39.900> fast<00:01:40.530> enough<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
f4 so that wasn't really fast enough for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
f4 so that wasn't really fast enough for
me<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> i<00:01:43.170> looked<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> f<00:01:44.310> 2.8<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> f

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
me so i looked at the f 2.8 and the f

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.710 
me so i looked at the f 2.8 and the f
2.8<00:01:46.040> usm<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:49.790> 1200<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> i<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
2.8 usm know is was 1200 and i got this

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
2.8 usm know is was 1200 and i got this
for<00:01:51.780> 800<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.040> retails<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.640> 1200<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.570> i<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
for 800 it retails for 1200 but i got it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.609 
for 800 it retails for 1200 but i got it
for<00:01:55.049> 800<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.600> camera<00:01:57.899> retail

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
for 800 at a this little camera retail

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.700 
for 800 at a this little camera retail
store

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.899 

the<00:02:03.690> only<00:02:04.690> little<00:02:05.229> downside<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:06.520> lens

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
the only little downside to this lens

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.919 
the only little downside to this lens
would<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.540> guess<00:02:07.869> be<00:02:08.229> there's<00:02:08.830> no<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.369> or<00:02:09.929> image

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
would I guess be there's no is or image

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.860 
would I guess be there's no is or image
stabilizing<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.940> you're<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.450> way<00:02:13.569> at

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
stabilizing one you're all the way at

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.250 
stabilizing one you're all the way at
when<00:02:14.650> you're<00:02:14.770> all<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.920> resumed<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.430> some<00:02:16.360> it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
when you're all the resumed in some it's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.590 
when you're all the resumed in some it's
all<00:02:17.740> these<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:18.550> these<00:02:18.580> little<00:02:18.880> movements<00:02:19.480> are

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
all these all these little movements are

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.699 
all these all these little movements are
like<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:21.780> they're<00:02:22.780> hard<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:26.319> need<00:02:26.560> is

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
like so they're hard to you need is

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.220 
like so they're hard to you need is
that's<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:28.060> trying<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.270> say<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that's what I'm trying to say but you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.660 
that's what I'm trying to say but you
just<00:02:32.410> need<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> faster<00:02:32.980> shutter<00:02:33.160> speed<00:02:33.489> really

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
just need a faster shutter speed really

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.710 
just need a faster shutter speed really
so<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:36.280> fine<00:02:36.640> most<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.180> time<00:02:37.390> it's

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
so it's it's fine most of the time it's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.259 
so it's it's fine most of the time it's
not<00:02:37.870> really<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> big<00:02:38.200> deal<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:39.190> that's<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
not really a big deal but that's the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.190 
not really a big deal but that's the
only<00:02:40.540> reason<00:02:40.690> i<00:02:41.080> would<00:02:41.320> consider<00:02:42.330> going<00:02:43.330> for

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
only reason i would consider going for

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.600 
only reason i would consider going for
the<00:02:44.290> canon<00:02:45.180> 70-200<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:47.110> sixteen<00:02:47.769> hundred

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the canon 70-200 the sixteen hundred

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.170 
the canon 70-200 the sixteen hundred
dollar<00:02:48.790> one<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.810> crazy<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.970> has<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
dollar one it's crazy the the it has a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.890 
dollar one it's crazy the the it has a
black<00:02:56.310> solid<00:02:57.310> black<00:02:57.670> finish<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.690> like

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
black solid black finish to it with like

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500 
black solid black finish to it with like
the<00:02:59.050> little<00:02:59.350> these<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.250> glossy<00:03:01.030> specks<00:03:01.390> in

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the little these little glossy specks in

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.640 
the little these little glossy specks in
it<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.550> sigma<00:03:04.090> e<00:03:04.120> x<00:03:04.650> which

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it so it's a it's a sigma e x which

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.759 
it so it's a it's a sigma e x which
means<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.069> has<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> certain<00:03:07.060> bit<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.530> doesn't

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
means it has a certain bit so it doesn't

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.080

you have this lens mounted without a
battery<00:05:11.150> grip<00:05:11.479> then<00:05:12.260> taking<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.830> course<00:05:13.520> which

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
battery grip then taking a course which

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.469 
battery grip then taking a course which
is<00:05:13.880> damn<00:05:14.600> near<00:05:14.720> impossible<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.240> what<00:05:17.360> it

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
is damn near impossible this is what it

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.150 
is damn near impossible this is what it
looks<00:05:17.660> like<00:05:18.400> mounted

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.920 

so<00:05:23.060> if<00:05:23.240> you're<00:05:23.330> going<00:05:23.450> to<00:05:23.510> be<00:05:23.630> taking

so if you're going to be taking

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.560 
so if you're going to be taking
portraits<00:05:24.140> with<00:05:24.530> a<00:05:24.650> little<00:05:24.980> butter<00:05:25.370> grip<00:05:25.670> then

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
portraits with a little butter grip then

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.950 
portraits with a little butter grip then
you'll<00:05:26.780> be<00:05:26.840> like<00:05:27.200> twisting<00:05:28.130> your<00:05:28.160> arm<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:28.960> yet

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
you'll be like twisting your arm and yet

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.840 
you'll be like twisting your arm and yet
melts<00:05:30.230> hired<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:30.830> trying<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.130> hold<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.610> steady

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
melts hired and trying to hold it steady

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.030 
melts hired and trying to hold it steady
but<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.990> battery<00:05:33.140> grip<00:05:33.380> really<00:05:33.650> helps<00:05:33.920> with

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
but the battery grip really helps with

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.400 
but the battery grip really helps with
top<00:05:34.190> so<00:05:34.820> i<00:05:35.150> would<00:05:35.840> definitely<00:05:35.870> recommend

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
top so i would definitely recommend

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.290 
top so i would definitely recommend
getting<00:05:36.950> a<00:05:37.130> better<00:05:37.280> grip<00:05:37.520> get<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.150> online

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300
