00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.370
 kenya could develop or object 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:47.399
 soulac 6.88 spect the hexagon said yes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 activities to say that just as much 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.149
 agency swing swing of the ball on this August 10th 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 is encrypted sting that lay testing 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.510
 in fact the best way we have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 found to practice the game internally 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.239
 anyway it was tournament and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.289
 make the internal competition 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.759
 competition it is not necessarily 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.140
 something that we have design and we 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.520
 do not know to go we'll start on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:36.090
 a competitive breeding ground the competition is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:39.119
 born naturally in fact when we 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.789
 look at a fps in fact we see 90% 100% 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.859
 almost 100% of the action by extending 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.210
 the camera view of the player and we in our 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.310
 fashion spectators we did the opposite 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.780
 I watch the entirety of the clips I 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.429
 see all the movements to be done I 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.560
 see all the preparatory work and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.820
 after when I need I can go 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 directly see the individual action 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:33.440
 this war has always wanted in all 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.700
 case to make sure that this game can 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.780
 to involve the players because 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.670
 that's what makes the difference 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.380
 and when we see that we play and we 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 gets caught up absorbed that begins to 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 see even bad behaviors 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.680
 days and that's it means we're 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.680
 really replay
