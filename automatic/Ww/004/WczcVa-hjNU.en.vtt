00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 a field of aluminum connected by 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.859
 logwin the use of aluminum rank 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.699
 when installing air conditioning systems 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.699
 offers many advantages 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 aluminum pipe is four times cheaper 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.390
 as copper and 3 times as light the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 All technical requirements are met 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.760
 just as good as copper therefore 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.840
 uses the automotive industry 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.739
 aluminum tubes says for decades 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.739
 vehicle air conditioners 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 Until now, aluminum tubes were seldom in 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.370
 the cold and air conditioning used 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.210
 because it is on construction sites only very 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 difficult to solve 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.070
 thanks to the new aluminum logging 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.360
 You can not make connections from now on 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.119
 only the advantages of the light metal 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.530
 use aluminum but also the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.060
 advantages our logging 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.500
 pipe connection anyway 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 has killed connection 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 there are no loose ones 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.009
 heat development and no risk of fire 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.880
 this saves everyone from having to solder 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.509
 necessary safety precautions 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.070
 fire protection regulations and sweat 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.020
 Permission omitted and thus 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.409
 additional bureaucratic effort and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.149
 annoying waiting times are on construction sites 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.350
 elaborate safety equipment and 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.580
 weightless equipment no longer necessary 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.049
 even in busy business premises 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.060
 You can do installations during the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.159
 carry out ongoing operations and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.820
 save your customers with it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 costly business or 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 business closures 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 but we do not do the installation 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 just easier but faster too 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.520
 every lorraine connection will save you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.340
 Spend 40 percent of your time compared to one 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.349
 lÃ¶ combine our ingenious principle makes 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.270
 In addition, for better quality 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.010
 because when soldering can even experienced 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.410
 Professionals sometimes can not avoid that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.590
 the air conditioning by heat or charged 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.599
 residues will damage the handling 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 with lok ring, however, is straightforward 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.500
 and easy to learn so that they are ours 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.150
 system safely and quickly after a short time 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.150
 easily apply 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.689
 and that's how easy the tube is first 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.849
 a advised and the tube in thoroughly 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:46.349
 clean up gain server insert 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.159
 even more stability in the connection 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.639
 to bring a piece of depth of the ear 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.639
 to mark 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.690
 afterwards, prep lures evenly to the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.610
 flows lures entire scope Apply 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.720
 even in the finest voids and 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.720
 fill it completely 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.390
 now the pipe end until the end of 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.040
 handshake in the clip and push 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.090
 with the mounting tool the lock ring 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.090
 press on the neck 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.739
 no matter what connection you create 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.319
 Glock Ring offers you for every assembly 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.330
 situation the right solution for both 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.560
 flammable refrigerants as well for the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.040
 refrigerant with a very high 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.040
 working pressure like r32 or r410 off 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.640
 have been logwin for over 30 years 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.659
 pipe connection successful in the cold 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.189
 and climate industry used more than 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.730
 were rings one billion lures 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:04:00.099
 since then it is quiet on the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.989
 air ring the world leader in lot 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.530
 free pipe connections for the cold 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.530
 and air conditioning 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.590
 five production sites and more than 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.510
 30 subsidiaries and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.950
 Trade Representatives ensure worldwide 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.010
 intelligent solutions best quality and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.010
 optimal service 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.760
 Thousands of climate installers trust 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.250
 already today the reliable lock 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.350
 have to give up 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.390
 now offers additional lure 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.010
 possibility the significant cost advantage 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.010
 to use of aluminum pipe 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.970
 make your installation too 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:46.280
 easier faster and cheaper with 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.280
 log in the best connection
