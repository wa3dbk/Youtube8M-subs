00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.580
 Our skin - a miracle of nature 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.329
 The skin is the most important protective layer against environmental influences 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:14.829
 It consists of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutaneous fatty tissue 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.940
 Horny cells develop continuously in the epidermis over several stages 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.259
 They form the horny layer. Within a month, the epidermis renews itself ... 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.739
 ... through the regrowing cells completely 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.639
 Greasy substances envelop the horny cells and fill in their interstices 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 They thus ensure a stable cell structure and are therefore one of the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.470
 most important prerequisites for the protective functions of the skin 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 Above the horny layer lies a thin protective film 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.140
 It contains fat of the sebaceous glands, water and salts, ... 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.820
 ... which are transported to the surface by sweat glands 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.540
 This protective film reacts chemically weakly acidic with a ph value of about 5.5 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.880
 Therefore, this water-fat film was formerly called acid-protective coat 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.550
 It forms another barrier against microorganisms and environmental influences 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.360
 The skin reacts sensitively to too much moisture or wetness 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.140
 The water-fat film is destroyed and the horny cells swell up 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 Horn layer fats are washed out, the skin becomes dry and permeable to foreign substances 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.219
 Our immune system reacts to these foreign substances with redness or scaling ... 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.000
 ... or blisters on the skin. An eczema has developed 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 If nothing is done, the skin may continue to inflame or even rupture 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 The regular use of skin protection creams and skin care creams ... 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.980
 ... supports the protective functions of the chief
