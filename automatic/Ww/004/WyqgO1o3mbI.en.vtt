00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 you stand in the board or garage 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 in front of the chancellery 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.480
 it's about prestige it's about size and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.359
 It's about the crown of automotive engineering 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 it comes to luxury limousine just a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 few days ago we were here 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.820
 with two thick chains in the hamburger 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 harbor they have compared to each other 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 the winner bmw and the mercedes s class 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 at that time the bmw did not win 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.239
 necessarily because the better car was 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.579
 but because he was above all cheaper 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 Today we want the 7er bmw again 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 compare however with a car 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 what are about the same cost 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 Changeover is a bit different 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.699
 this is not just because of the fog 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 a little less is the water 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.239
 but also that both cars no 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.530
 have eight more cylinders under the hood 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.530
 and no gasoline 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 but they come with the so-called 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 base engines with six-cylinder 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.570
 diesel engines we want to see it out 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 who is the better 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.189
 Today, it's not just about fat 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 pÃ¶tte but also for thrift eco 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.630
 is the new luxury and promise 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 these two are under six liters 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 it can stay in use 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.780
 nobody surprised that both you 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 have missed class goal anyway 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 There was a big surprise when 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 Test consumption of the bmw makes after his 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 win against the s class in the beginning of the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 comparison against the mercedes he could 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 still score with its price 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.030
 today's edition of the bmw costs as 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.470
 37 in our test 84,000 150 euro 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 we certainly do not reveal too much 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 if we say at this point he is 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.270
 again a little cheaper than his 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.520
 competitor, however, only 660 euros for it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.479
 But there is also only rear drive of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.189
 motor is a three-liter 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.030
 six-cylinder with turbo charging 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.430
 he does 258 ps exactly as much as 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.950
 the audi also the bmw accelerates from 0 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 on 100 in 6 5 seconds and must be 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.780
 give the audi beaten the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.440
 topspeed is the same again 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.319
 51 km / h no surprise that lurks 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.660
 when consumption bmw gives him 5 6 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 diesel and would be better 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.650
 as the audi with our consumers 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.530
 but approves the Munich one 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.810
 In addition, more than 7.9 liters are available 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.380
 at the end of the test report this is more than 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.540
 at audi 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.730
 however, 7 also had something closer 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.350
 to gas the esp flashes though 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.970
 more often because of the rear-wheel drive 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.650
 not always the full traction on the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 road brings also has yes 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 its nice i have it at the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.769
 comparison with the s class said and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.160
 even in comparison to the a8 stands out 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.239
 the 7 he is a driver car remembers it 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.769
 not that he only has six now 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.480
 cylinder and pay attention beforehand under the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.250
 had and also whether these or 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 gasoline is ultimately the same 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060
 character stays the same 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.010
 one thing about that, a great one 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.800
 Steering has an integral active steering system 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.500
 and bmw that costs 2000 euro 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.670
 extra price and excellent braking 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.989
 But now we do not 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.060
 try out the cameraman by 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.709
 the discs of the 7 Series is technical and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.940
 still dynamic at the height of 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.160
 time though he is in german 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.690
 luxury sedan league the oldest he is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.790
 has the s-class by its low 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.750
 cost beaten and also the audi a8 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.700
 meets a hard one from the he 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.650
 But do not be intimidated 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.299
 The facelift of the a8 is mainly due to the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.400
 to recognize new front headlights 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.890
 However, you get the new lights 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.470
 graphic first when the led package and the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.200
 costs 1600 euros surcharge 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.090
 the new matrix beam of each 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560
 diodes can switch off and on and off 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.570
 against traffic does not dazzle costs 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.549
 even 2400 euros more 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.290
 otherwise audi has above all the engine 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.310
 revised and that makes it clear 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.660
 noticeable 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 the three-liter turbodiesel is a v6 with 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.959
 258 ps there have been about the technician 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.269
 The two Bavarian car makers 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.070
 not quite agreed one would think 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.660
 the torque is audi namely 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.340
 slightly higher and at the acceleration 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.420
 makes the better traction thanks 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.549
 all-wheel noticeable 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.310
 The tip of the balance is in this 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.470
 but compare the consumption 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.940
 after all, both luxury saver want 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.700
 his 5.9 liters gives audi more than bmw 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.180
 The test consumption is indeed 1.2 liters 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.610
 higher 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.040
 but it is also 0.8 liters below that 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.700
 from bmw and this is already one in everyday life 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.650
 whole lot 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.030
 financially, the one owner 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.600
 not really luxury limousines 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.430
 interest 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.010
 but for comparison, it is not one 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.330
 insignificant point is another 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.220
 the comfort in the interior 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.200
 Both cars are there at the forefront in the 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:51.470
 Automotive world and still there 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:54.020
 small differences center console 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.850
 he has all-wheel drive as standard and he 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.979
 also has air suspension as standard 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.590
 and you can tell that clearly to me 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.120
 not so much like this is something 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.800
 Smooth steering has to be said 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.750
 Of course that suits the comfortable one 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.639
 character but that does not offer either 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.620
 much feedback the facelift of the audi 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.520
 he succeeded and he acts exactly that 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.210
 yes, with such a revision 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.250
 aim fresher than the bmw from the outside 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.510
 it is only discreet but technical 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.830
 the engineers have exactly the same 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.320
 turned right screw 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.250
 if that's enough for an overall victory 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.870
 I'll check where the wind is coming from 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.910
 I would say today from the south because the 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.300
 Bavarians make it out of themselves 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.880
 is the better car the audi or the 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.010
 bmw frankly it was rarely such a 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.330
 ask the taste like today would like 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.190
 For example, a four-wheel drive 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.539
 then you have to actually audi 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.210
 grab because here is the quattro 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.590
 but now you want one as standard 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.660
 Tail drive then you can not do that 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.630
 take because there is no rear-wheel drive 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.880
 there's only here at the seven bmw 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.200
 both are very characteristically 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.690
 similar because both are above all 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.510
 Sporty luxury sedan 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.789
 But you can also comfort that is 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.360
 Choosing a winner today is scary 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.160
 heavy 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.970
 but we have to decide and 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.970
 That's why the winner is 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.080
 the Ingolstadt with the four rings 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.909
 is the winner of the place because he 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.340
 more economical is offering more space and 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.110
 Modern effect of the bmw remains true 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.259
 award-winning but only thanks to the 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.460
 660 euro he costs less in this 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.430
 this is nothing 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.349
 besides, a four-wheel drive would be 3400 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.240
 euro surcharge therefore costs the audi 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.340
 at the end even endkosten chapter forward 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.879
 because he just more car for the money 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.879
 provides
