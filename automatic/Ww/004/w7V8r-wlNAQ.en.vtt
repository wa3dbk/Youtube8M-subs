but what I wanted to talk about was

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.860 
but what I wanted to talk about was
getting<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.520> running<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
getting this thing up and running the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
getting this thing up and running the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
parts that you see listed are going to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.139 
parts that you see listed are going to
be<00:00:42.890> pieces<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> course<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
be pieces that over the course of time I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
be pieces that over the course of time I
wanted<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> build<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.260> relatively

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
wanted to build this relatively

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750 
wanted to build this relatively
inexpensively<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.649> waited<00:00:49.649> scoured<00:00:50.520> way

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
inexpensively so I waited scoured way

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
inexpensively so I waited scoured way
don't<00:00:50.969> clearance<00:00:51.390> things<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.020> built<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
don't clearance things and built a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630 
don't clearance things and built a
really<00:00:53.430> good<00:00:53.699> system<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:55.110> decent<00:00:55.320> price<00:00:55.640> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
really good system for a decent price I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.389 
really good system for a decent price I
had<00:00:57.059> considered<00:00:57.600> smaller<00:00:58.320> items<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
had considered smaller items like a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
had considered smaller items like a
little<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> Mac<00:01:00.960> Mini<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.530> something

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
little like a Mac Mini or something

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
little like a Mac Mini or something
along<00:01:02.039> those<00:01:02.430> lines<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.750> particular

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
along those lines and this particular

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
along those lines and this particular
computer<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.460> stay<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.119> for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
computer will probably stay as it is for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.929 
computer will probably stay as it is for
a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.600> while<00:01:06.750> longer<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.409> eventually

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
a little while longer but eventually

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
a little while longer but eventually
probably<00:01:08.939> you'll<00:01:09.299> turn<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.750> an<00:01:10.350> ass

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
probably you'll turn it into an ass

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.510 
probably you'll turn it into an ass
system<00:01:11.070> eventually<00:01:11.400> um<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:13.280> wanted<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> keep

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
system eventually um I wanted to keep

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.690 
system eventually um I wanted to keep
things<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.060> cheap<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.439> first<00:01:16.700> my

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
things really cheap and so at first my

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
things really cheap and so at first my
thought<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> boom<00:01:18.930> tube<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.580> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
thought was to go with a boom tube and I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.399 
thought was to go with a boom tube and I
wanted<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.509> hyper<00:01:21.720> critical<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
wanted to be really hyper critical of a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.310 
wanted to be really hyper critical of a
boon<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> minute<00:01:23.310> um<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.659> very

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
boon to for a minute um because I'm very

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.280 
boon to for a minute um because I'm very
disappointed<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.390> I'm<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.689> disappointed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
disappointed and I'm not disappointed

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
disappointed and I'm not disappointed
because<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.400> didn't<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.909> any<00:01:30.090> better<00:01:30.119> I'm

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
because I didn't know any better I'm

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
because I didn't know any better I'm
disappointed<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:32.280> took<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
disappointed because I actually took the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
disappointed because I actually took the
time<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.509> online<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.170> different<00:01:34.500> forums

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
time to go online to different forums

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670 
time to go online to different forums
and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.700> tried<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> find<00:01:36.299> hardware<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.500> would

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and I tried to find hardware that would

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
and I tried to find hardware that would
work<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> boom<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.759> was<00:01:39.299> listed<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
work with a boom to that was listed as

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.740 
work with a boom to that was listed as
compatible<00:01:40.619> hardware<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:42.240> really

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
compatible hardware and that's really

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.310 
compatible hardware and that's really
really<00:01:42.960> hard<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:44.299> my<00:01:45.299> primary<00:01:45.600> problems

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
really hard to do my primary problems

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.700 
really hard to do my primary problems
were<00:01:46.649> video<00:01:47.220> cards<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.350> wireless<00:01:49.350> cards

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
were video cards and wireless cards

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.210 
were video cards and wireless cards
pretty<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.310> everything<00:01:50.610> else<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.149> far<00:01:51.180> as

pretty much everything else as far as

pretty much everything else as far as
hardware<00:01:53.220> parts<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:54.299> were<00:01:54.360> fine<00:01:54.979> all<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
hardware parts they were fine all the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
work properly and that sometimes we turn

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.309 
work properly and that sometimes we turn
the<00:02:42.180> system<00:02:42.359> off<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.019> turned<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> back

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
the system off and then turned it back

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.240 
the system off and then turned it back
on<00:02:44.030> all<00:02:45.030> kinds<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.750> happen<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:47.069> I

on all kinds of would happen and I
couldn't<00:02:47.579> get<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:48.000> be<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.629> hundred<00:02:49.230> percent

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
couldn't get it to be a hundred percent

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.119 
couldn't get it to be a hundred percent
stable<00:02:50.099> working<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.780> flawless<00:02:52.470> different

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129
