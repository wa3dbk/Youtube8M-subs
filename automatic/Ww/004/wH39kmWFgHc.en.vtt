extreme<00:02:17.560> speed<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.069> will<00:02:18.519> expect<00:02:18.819> him<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.150> go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
extreme speed I will expect him to go

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.339 
extreme speed I will expect him to go
into<00:02:19.420> extreme<00:02:19.870> speed<00:02:20.140> again<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.630> think

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
into extreme speed again so I just think

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.589 
into extreme speed again so I just think
what<00:02:23.560> move<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.069> use<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.430> yanmega<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> I

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
what move I can use on yanmega and I

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.170 
what move I can use on yanmega and I
just<00:02:25.840> decided<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.319> go<00:02:26.440> for<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.680> air<00:02:26.860> /<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.700> I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
just decided to go for the air / and I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.630 
just decided to go for the air / and I
thought<00:02:28.540> air<00:02:28.810> /<00:02:29.170> would<00:02:29.590> do<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.130> bit<00:02:30.610> more

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
thought air / would do a bit more

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.759 
thought air / would do a bit more
because<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.840> life-form<00:02:32.290> damage<00:02:32.560> would

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
because then the life-form damage would

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.680 
because then the life-form damage would
have<00:02:32.920> finished<00:02:33.069> up<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.430> lucario<00:02:33.880> but

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
have finished up the lucario but

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.470 
have finished up the lucario but
unfortunately<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.590> doesn't<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.480> Lucario

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
unfortunately it doesn't and Lucario

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720 
unfortunately it doesn't and Lucario
will<00:02:37.690> remain<00:02:38.110> alive<00:02:38.440> at<00:02:38.739> one<00:02:39.040> hit<00:02:39.280> points<00:02:39.640> oh

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
will remain alive at one hit points oh

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.000 
will remain alive at one hit points oh
yeah<00:02:39.880> that's<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.330> 20<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.200> Lucario<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.830> this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
yeah that's like 20 for Lucario at this

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.210 
yeah that's like 20 for Lucario at this
point<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.390> actually<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.470> nothing<00:02:44.709> good<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
point so actually I have nothing good to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.490 
point so actually I have nothing good to
switch<00:02:45.640> into<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:49.569> switched<00:02:49.900> into<00:02:50.230> my

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
switch into so I just switched into my

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.059 
switch into so I just switched into my
flag<00:02:50.830> on<00:02:51.040> here<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:52.140> decide<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.739> stay

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
flag on here and I decide just to stay

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.250 
flag on here and I decide just to stay
in<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.519> let<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.239> lifework<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.840> its<00:02:55.989> work

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
in and let the lifework do its work

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.070 
in and let the lifework do its work
after<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> extreme<00:02:57.430> speed<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.910> my<00:02:58.780> red-eyes

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
after the extreme speed and my red-eyes

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960 
after the extreme speed and my red-eyes
survives<00:02:59.739> at<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.220> point<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.670> was

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

takes the ice fang pretty well here so i
just<00:03:26.709> decide<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:28.269> free<00:03:28.480> for<00:03:28.750> st.<00:03:29.019> because

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
just decide to go free for st. because

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.220 
just decide to go free for st. because

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's the only thing i can do because i

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's the only thing i can do because i
have<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.680> nothing<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.430> switch<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.940> at<00:03:34.060> this

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
have like nothing to switch in at this

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.229 
have like nothing to switch in at this
point<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:36.160> i<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.459> go<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:38.700> facade<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.970> it

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
point so i just go for the facade and it

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.539 
point so i just go for the facade and it
just<00:03:40.859> doesn't<00:03:41.859> do<00:03:42.010> quite<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.549> lot<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.209> glass<00:03:43.510> or

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
just doesn't do quite a lot to glass or

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.280 
just doesn't do quite a lot to glass or
maybe<00:03:45.549> because<00:03:45.700> glasser<00:03:46.150> has<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:46.630> amazing

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
maybe because glasser has like amazing

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
maybe because glasser has like amazing
defenses<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:49.200> after<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.290> battle<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.100> killer

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
defenses and after the battle the killer

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.860 
defenses and after the battle the killer
nacho<00:03:51.489> told<00:03:51.910> me<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.329> is<00:03:52.450> actually<00:03:52.600> a

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
nacho told me that this is actually a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.160 
nacho told me that this is actually a
sword<00:03:53.350> dancing<00:03:54.150> Gliscor<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.480> yeah<00:03:55.720> it's<00:03:55.900> like

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
sword dancing Gliscor so yeah it's like

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.470 
sword dancing Gliscor so yeah it's like
not<00:03:56.739> much<00:03:56.920> if<00:03:57.250> he<00:03:57.489> trained<00:03:57.819> in<00:03:58.000> attack<00:03:58.269> but

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
not much if he trained in attack but

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.449 
not much if he trained in attack but
mostly<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:59.049> defense<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.680> stuff<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.340> that's

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
mostly in defense and stuff so that's

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.360 
mostly in defense and stuff so that's
pretty<00:04:00.760> amazing<00:04:01.139> so<00:04:02.139> I<00:04:02.170> just<00:04:02.590> decided<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:03.190> go

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
pretty amazing so I just decided to go

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.900 
pretty amazing so I just decided to go
into<00:04:03.639> a<00:04:04.450> flower<00:04:04.930> power<00:04:05.350> again<00:04:05.730> which<00:04:06.730> will

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
into a flower power again which will

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.170 
into a flower power again which will
definitely<00:04:07.359> out<00:04:07.540> speed<00:04:07.989> gliscor<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.909> just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180
