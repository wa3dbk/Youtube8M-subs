six years ago and it's just sort of

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.660 
six years ago and it's just sort of
evolved<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.590> racers<00:03:43.920> go<00:03:44.130> faster<00:03:44.549> and

evolved and as racers go faster and
lighter<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.420> issues<00:03:45.660> almost<00:03:45.989> seem<00:03:46.200> heavy<00:03:47.040> in

like<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.280> more<00:04:08.430> obscure<00:04:09.709> for<00:04:10.709> me<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:10.859> like<00:04:11.099> this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
like the more obscure for me I like this

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.429 
like the more obscure for me I like this
one<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.239> called<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> s<00:04:12.629> lab<00:04:12.870> fell<00:04:13.170> cross

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
one this is called the s lab fell cross

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.869 
one this is called the s lab fell cross
it<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:13.920> actually<00:04:14.250> designed<00:04:14.370> around<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
it was actually designed around the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.370 
it was actually designed around the
British<00:04:15.299> fell<00:04:15.569> racing<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.019> don't<00:04:16.169> know<00:04:16.229> if<00:04:16.320> you

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
British fell racing I don't know if you

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.279 
British fell racing I don't know if you
know<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:17.389> some<00:04:18.389> crazy<00:04:18.630> guys<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
know what that is some crazy guys in the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.990 
know what that is some crazy guys in the
north<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.590> England<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.100> Wales<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.850> that

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
north of England and Wales and in that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.120 
north of England and Wales and in that
area<00:04:21.239> they<00:04:21.509> they<00:04:22.289> do<00:04:22.350> these<00:04:22.530> really<00:04:22.800> extreme

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
area they they do these really extreme

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.070 
area they they do these really extreme
races<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.699> steep<00:04:24.000> hills<00:04:24.210> very<00:04:24.570> wet<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
races very steep hills very wet so the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.260 
races very steep hills very wet so the
idea<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:26.009> make<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.370> much<00:04:26.610> traction<00:04:27.000> as

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
idea is just to make as much traction as

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150 
idea is just to make as much traction as
possible<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:28.169> close<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> ground<00:04:28.830> and

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
possible as close to the ground and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.370 
possible as close to the ground and
absorbing<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.599> least<00:04:30.780> amount<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.169> water

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
absorbing it the least amount of water

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.620 
absorbing it the least amount of water
and<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.070> very<00:04:32.280> extreme<00:04:32.759> sort<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.300> like

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
and a very very extreme sort of I like

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.689 
and a very very extreme sort of I like
stuff<00:04:33.870> like<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:36.199> yeah<00:04:37.199> and<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.699> shoes

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
stuff like this yeah and I like shoes

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.930 
stuff like this yeah and I like shoes
like<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.030> which<00:04:39.330> we<00:04:39.539> actually<00:04:39.840> designed<00:04:40.940> as

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
like this which we actually designed as

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.270 
like this which we actually designed as
a<00:04:41.970> little<00:04:42.240> tungsten<00:04:42.960> carbide<00:04:43.380> tip<00:04:43.770> spikes<00:04:44.070> for

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
love it this shoe also has something we

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.189 
love it this shoe also has something we
call<00:04:52.919> Klima<00:04:53.250> shield<00:04:53.580> it's<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.690> membrane<00:04:55.080> that

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
call Klima shield it's a membrane that

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.719 
call Klima shield it's a membrane that
just<00:04:55.380> goes<00:04:55.530> over<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.860> toe<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.490> tongue

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
just goes over the toe and of the tongue

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.360 
just goes over the toe and of the tongue
sort<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.780> like<00:04:57.840> wearing<00:04:58.169> a<00:04:58.289> vest<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:59.130> the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
sort of like wearing a vest in the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.800 
sort of like wearing a vest in the
winter<00:04:59.610> time<00:04:59.729> instead<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.150> full<00:05:00.300> jack<00:05:00.599> it

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
winter time instead of a full jack it

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.110 
winter time instead of a full jack it
allows<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.229> shooter<00:05:01.260> Brianne<00:05:01.940> good<00:05:02.940> bet

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
allows the shooter Brianne good bet

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.390 
allows the shooter Brianne good bet
that's<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.900> good<00:05:04.050> idea<00:05:04.139> but<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.039> is<00:05:05.130> exactly

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
that's a good idea but it is exactly
