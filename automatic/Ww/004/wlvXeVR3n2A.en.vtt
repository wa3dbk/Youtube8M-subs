now serie dill is a big prize a fertile

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.720 
now serie dill is a big prize a fertile
heartland<00:00:31.749> of<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.500> continent<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:33.310> it's<00:00:33.520> also

the symbol of power over Tamriel in the
white<00:00:37.210> gold<00:00:37.480> tower<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:38.110> has<00:00:38.230> been<00:00:38.410> the

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
white gold tower that has been the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.410 
white gold tower that has been the

center of the Empire for millennia now

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.200 
center of the Empire for millennia now
so<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.200> three<00:00:41.410> alliances<00:00:41.620> all<00:00:42.520> have<00:00:43.000> their

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
so the three alliances all have their

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.080 
so the three alliances all have their
own<00:00:43.330> reasons<00:00:43.870> why<00:00:44.860> they<00:00:45.280> feel<00:00:45.580> like<00:00:45.880> they

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
own reasons why they feel like they

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.600 
own reasons why they feel like they
should<00:00:46.300> be<00:00:46.480> ruling<00:00:47.440> serie<00:00:47.860> dill<00:00:48.100> but<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
should be ruling serie dill but the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.790 
should be ruling serie dill but the
fundamental<00:00:49.240> reason<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.410> Empire

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
fundamental reason is that the Empire

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.580 
fundamental reason is that the Empire
and<00:00:51.100> serie<00:00:51.340> dill<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> family<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.870> nobles

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
and serie dill and the family of nobles

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.320 
and serie dill and the family of nobles
the<00:00:53.800> Farnes<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.460> are<00:00:54.550> ruling<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:54.940> are<00:00:55.090> weak

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
the Farnes that are ruling it are weak

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:08.290 
the Farnes that are ruling it are weak
and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.620> Alliance's<00:00:57.190> are<00:00:57.520> strong

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.360 

so<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.390> Empire<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> weak<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.770> their<00:01:10.980> leaders

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.780 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders
are<00:01:11.610> cunning<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> current<00:01:14.040> occupant<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> the

connections<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.390> becomes<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:54.990> more

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
