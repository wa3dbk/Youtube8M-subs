00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.100
 back world so that's what I have 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.100
 always 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.440
 for a new video still just 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.640
 before the one I just did 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.369
 quick to show to show 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.500
 down how to download to blinds at pk 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:32.300
 for blue stack on sites all to 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 mena house km to Beijing so there you have 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.129
 full of games with direct links 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.960
 so after there are really lots of games 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:48.410
 close I can show you a little 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.770
 example of young people for example 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:59.420
 big theft auto iii 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:01:02.090
 fifa 12 gta vice city for example if we 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.580
 looked at it that's simple so when 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.060
 you have the gta vice city must raise 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.729
 lift the seat 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.299
 the complete version an imposter not 3 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.659
 flawless plus datas and direct line 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:24.110
 pts 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:28.220
 so that's more for the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:38.420
 laptops I believe so there you have them 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:40.340
 links the expensive hippies here normally 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.970
 the data I do not really know what it is 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.659
 than me when they help you so often 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.860
 on the sd card and all and on the senses 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.780
 the phones do not cover the link 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.340
 does not exist like that it's good so 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.909
 yes there are links that are crazy so 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.909
 to be careful 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.000
 but they are not all like that 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.780
 so parents have me that one does not want 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:20.770
 to come it a little bit of time there 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.770
 bug a little bit short you have to search 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.790
 you have to look a little bit and you 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:39.300
 will have a lot of good links so that's 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:50.220
