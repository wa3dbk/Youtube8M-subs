00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello and welcome to a new video quality year so Bochert 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.040
 Today we will show you a new device again 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.979
 the Algeria 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.749
 how much time does this have? 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.610
 and quite normal smart 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.240
 and we all use interest in daily a smartphone user needs 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.579
 used to it 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.069
 a problem is mostly where to go with the smartphone 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.140
 and to that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 against the PTB Ribery first a super possibility 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.220
 because you can use them as a primary smartphone 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.710
 Use the bracket as we have the smartphone behind 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.690
 and we can 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.820
 also it can be easy 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 all are not shown from the side 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.140
 we have here on the page 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.080
 That's so nice 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.880
 and beyond 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.680
 we see that samples 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 m just mourn each one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700
 small combo five pawls 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.850
 Connection HAZ 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.450
 SID around one like the daily one can there then this cable with the listener then 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.200
 lay 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.360
 this higher value was also added to Irene 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.320
 and if you can call 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.890
 and that is quite normal use as a phone now we see that the call 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.610
 coming 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.910
 and you can take it off normally 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.740
 and talk to the phone as you would with one 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 SEPPmail senior corridor phone 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.570
 In addition, we now have it with another 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.590
 To make a smartphone 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.330
 for example with the price were 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.620
 with any smartphone as I said that a Mediacom has an end 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.470
 but also possible is of course that that as a charging station 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.370
 in the Bernd Eichhorn has charger and it can then easily down 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.650
 for example, plug in the iPhone 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.649
 we have each one 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.950
 Snoek has been achieved 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.970
 but no door I plug in any other chargers 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.890
 around the material of the Maurice aluminum and plastic 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 The procedure itself is 20 by 21 centimeters 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 tall and weighs 400 grams 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.610
 and is also in the jersey 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.610
 in aluminum Lucas outside also looks good 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 We can currently recommend all riders 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.749
 and it also makes a super retro-look so you all Nostra lie under us 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.459
 it is ideally suited 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.110
 the cost is ninth on 91 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 and as I said you can get that too funky now goes down in the cradle 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.249
 You will also find a description of this description 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.920
 Green boss Roth with the old methods until the next video of 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:31.569
