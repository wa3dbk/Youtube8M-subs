00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
better I often talk about that seesaw

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
better I often talk about that seesaw
between<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> parasympathetic<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
between the parasympathetic and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.140 
between the parasympathetic and
sympathetic<00:01:05.070> branch<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> nervous<00:01:06.119> system

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sympathetic branch of the nervous system

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
sympathetic branch of the nervous system
your<00:01:06.600> autonomic<00:01:06.869> nervous<00:01:07.350> system<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.770> how

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
your autonomic nervous system and how

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
your autonomic nervous system and how
one's<00:01:08.490> catabolic<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> anabolic<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
one's catabolic and want to anabolic and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.340 
one's catabolic and want to anabolic and
and<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.590> literally<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.170> balancing<00:01:13.170> act

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and there literally is a balancing act

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.370 
and there literally is a balancing act
within<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:14.040> physiology<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:15.150> day<00:01:15.659> every<00:01:16.350> day

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
within your physiology all day every day

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.800 
within your physiology all day every day
I<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.490> changing<00:01:18.030> based<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I mean it's it's changing based on the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
I mean it's it's changing based on the
positions<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.070> celestial<00:01:21.000> bodies<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
positions of the celestial bodies I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
positions of the celestial bodies I
swear<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> God<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.680> based<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
swear to God you know based on the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
swear to God you know based on the
position<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> moon<00:01:23.640> based<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.509> time

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
position of the moon based on the time

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
position of the moon based on the time
with<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> month<00:01:25.229> based<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.670> many

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
with a month based on there's so many

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
with a month based on there's so many
different<00:01:27.090> factors<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:28.049> body<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
different factors but your body is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.520 
different factors but your body is
constantly<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> state<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> flux<00:01:30.810> between

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
constantly in this state of flux between

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.980 
constantly in this state of flux between
these<00:01:32.100> two<00:01:32.930> seemingly<00:01:33.930> opposite<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
these two seemingly opposite but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.999 
these two seemingly opposite but
supportive<00:01:37.909> ends<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:40.009> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
supportive ends of your the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.230 
supportive ends of your the
physiological<00:01:41.520> response<00:01:41.820> within<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.150> body

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
physiological response within your body

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.460 
physiological response within your body
anyway<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.829> when<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> far<00:01:45.079> bird<00:01:46.079> out

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
anyway so when you're that far bird out

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
anyway so when you're that far bird out
you're<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.820> exercises

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you're going to want to do exercises

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
you're going to want to do exercises
that<00:01:48.869> help<00:01:49.049> stimulate<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.040> bring<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> back

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that help stimulate to bring you back

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.440 
that help stimulate to bring you back
into<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.840> building<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.030> anabolism<00:01:54.030> like

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
into more building up anabolism like

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
into more building up anabolism like
you're<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:54.780> you're<00:01:54.899> brave<00:01:55.079> you're<00:01:55.229> burnt

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you're very you're brave you're burnt

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're very you're brave you're burnt
down<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> very<00:01:55.799> catabolic<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.490> point<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
down you very catabolic at this point so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
down you very catabolic at this point so
you're<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> exercise<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.590> how

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you're going to want to exercise but how

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
you're going to want to exercise but how
you<00:01:58.860> exercise

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you exercise
