00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 welcome again to another comment 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 range today's leaves the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 most recent movie of pixel inside 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.750
 out known in Latin America as 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 intensely or as networks in Spain 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.650
 the story centers on a girl of 11 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 years called raili and his emotions that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 they are represented as five characters 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 that live in your mind joy sadness 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.710
 fury displeasure and fear the conflict 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.420
 index when reilly must move a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.400
 new city what matches what 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 sadness that not only marginalized by 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 joy feels driven to affect 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 the memories of raiden what ends 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.969
 that both are lost in your mind 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.760
 causing a series of problems 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 unexpected the animation work is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 very well done the designs of the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.770
 main characters are pretty 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 simple but the scenarios and others 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 effects are notoriously satisfactory 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 the movie does not seek to surprise on the basis 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 to this aspect but it is in the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.899
 Same high standard of other deliveries 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 recent of pixar the characters in their 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 Most are pretty flat and health 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 joy they have no further development in and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 variety making your reactions 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.880
 be somewhat predictable however 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 they are representations of emotions 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 it is obvious that in conditions 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.979
 normal his behavior looks 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.140
 limited to the emotion it represents 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.119
 even though we know of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.829
 beforehand how they will react not 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.630
 can be the situations stop being 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.789
 funny , which denotes very good 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 work on the script as to the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.720
 history although according to the structure very 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.429
 similar to other pixar films and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.259
 You could even say it 's like a 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.539
 alternate version of toy story is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.039
 consistent is entertaining has 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.110
 unexpected plot holes 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.880
 symbolic elements that deserve a 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.819
 second look and even moments 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 quite sad as in the case 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.849
 of up to be the movie is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.409
 mainly aimed at children 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.229
 they have the enjoyment for the characters 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.610
 the jokes and the present adventure this 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.560
 acquires a greater meaning for the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
 adults who have a strong 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 emotional impact can get up to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 the tears of some spectators 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.270
 Now I would like to refer a point 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.679
 It has been mentioned fairly around 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 this film and it 's about its 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.179
 originality certainly the concept of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 personify human emotions I've already 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.110
 said several times before and as 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.940
 I mentioned recently the plot follows a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.609
 pretty repeated structure and up 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.720
 recognizable but they know that I do not tell you 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.730
 the critic called 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.770
 one of the most creative productions of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.750
 pixar is not concerned in which the idea in 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.430
 yes it has not been done before but the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.610
 how it worked with her was extremely 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.380
 creative and I agree of course 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.150
 the human mind is much more complex than 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.350
 what is shown here but how 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.570
 that represent the various 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.910
 elements of it very imaginative already 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.470
 it's slightly informative really it 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.180
 appreciates the effort of production in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.670
 consult with professional psychologists 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.140
 about it and also when daring 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.970
 talk about issues like stability 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 emotional from a more perspective 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.800
 modern and real despite being on 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.590
 simplified by the narrative zones 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.810
 to finish is a good movie me 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.820
 I think so although I think a better 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.370
 description for inside that is to say 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.050
 which is a beautiful movie and if you 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 allow you to connect with your 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.000
 emotions you can enjoy it to the fullest 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.470
 in fact I would dare to say that it is a 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.770
 of the best movies he has done 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.230
 pixar so far I'm fast random 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.440
 and that has been my comment about it 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.440
 see you soon 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.430
 and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.250
 one 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.810
 you do not pay me, it does not even exist 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.640
 you're just an ingenious visual metaphor 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.480
 which represents the abstract concept of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.480
 thought
