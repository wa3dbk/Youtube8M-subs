s5<00:01:48.829> which<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> compatible<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:51.930> iPhone

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
s5 which is compatible I think my iPhone

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.039 
s5 which is compatible I think my iPhone
connected<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> -<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:56.689> set<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> pair

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
connected to it - and you set the pair

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.370 
connected to it - and you set the pair
with<00:01:58.229> them<00:02:01.579> it's<00:02:02.579> usually<00:02:02.729> relatively<00:02:03.479> fast

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.440 

I<00:02:06.469> found<00:02:07.100> it's<00:02:07.280> faster<00:02:07.790> if<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:08.030> turn<00:02:08.300> your

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
I found it's faster if you turn your

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.300 
I found it's faster if you turn your
Bluetooth<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:08.989> your<00:02:09.170> phone<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.619> first<00:02:10.039> before

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
Bluetooth on your phone on first before

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.360 
Bluetooth on your phone on first before
you<00:02:11.620> pair<00:02:12.620> them

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.550 

so<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.030> connected<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.500> know

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so there we have it's connected you know

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:32.630 
so there we have it's connected you know
I<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.860> play<00:02:21.010> some<00:02:21.220> music

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170
