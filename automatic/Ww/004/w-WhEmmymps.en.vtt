00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.490 
let me try one of each I don't expand to
be<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.370> spicy<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.150> seems<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:22.020> there's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
be that spicy because seems like there's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:37.370 
be that spicy because seems like there's
not<00:02:22.770> too<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.069> sauce<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.709> here<00:02:25.709> goes

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.060 

I<00:02:37.410> am<00:02:38.250> somewhat<00:02:39.150> impressed<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.810> far<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:41.010> let's

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
I am somewhat impressed so far but let's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:50.960 
I am somewhat impressed so far but let's
try<00:02:41.370> another<00:02:41.550> piece<00:02:49.490> okay<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.520> think<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.940> have

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
try another piece okay I think I have

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.950 
try another piece okay I think I have
diverted<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:53.130> off<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> bat<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.690> taste

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
diverted right off the bat you taste

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.960 
diverted right off the bat you taste
that<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:56.310> Tabasco<00:02:57.380> flavor<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.790> it's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that that Tabasco flavor and it's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.780 
that that Tabasco flavor and it's
definitely<00:03:00.510> saltier<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.260> spicier<00:03:02.190> than<00:03:02.430> say

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
definitely saltier and spicier than say

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.950

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
the TGIF frozen wings but it might be

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.120 
the TGIF frozen wings but it might be
just<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.350> little<00:03:07.380> bit<00:03:07.890> too<00:03:08.130> much<00:03:08.340> salt<00:03:09.210> on<00:03:09.360> there

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
just a little bit too much salt on there

that saltiness with that tank and that
somewhat<00:03:20.400> spicy<00:03:20.940> flavor<00:03:21.620> makes<00:03:22.620> this
