 First you cut with the paper 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.399
 scissors the template out cut them 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.030
 the cut would be exactly on the line 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:56.729
 parts on the felt fasten the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.729
 Template with pins on the felt 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.750
 In the tailor chalk and mark the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.670
 outlines of the template on the cloth 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 draw the larger cut for the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.490
 front and back two times 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 Couple and eyes are sitting pause 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.750
 face with tailor copy paper through 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.480
 would be the copy paper between template 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.630
 and felt head and draw the lines 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.630
 to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.680
 same thing with the front part there 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.450
 you mark where the button is sewn 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.229
 put the head what later 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.430
 our flap is turned upside down and on 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.430
 attach it with pins 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.970
 Close the whole thing with a cross stitch 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.509
 remember you for that you need because 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.800
 about worldly engraving and next then 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.880
 mirrored back so that one 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880
 Cross stitch is created 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.540
 Pieces now take the eyes every stitch 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.930
 double so that the cross is also correct 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 gets fat 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.840
 sew the thread well and the second one 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.310
 stuck in the eye 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.840
 we must continue with the cats mustache 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.840
 and danish ears 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.040
 Here you take a free I research 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.810
 stick as you would draw and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 far before the thread at the end 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.570
 Close the button on the front part of the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.570
 mark for that you already have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.769
 as a button bend you take 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 narrow piece of rock that you flip around 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.980
 the button would be the front part on the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.920
 back and the exact length of the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 to schedule a loop 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.290
 attach and secure the pin 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.489
 if you have the ends under the mustache 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.040
 put and exactly in the mustache 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.180
 enclosing the seam is invisible 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.650
 reach a few stitches already 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.650
 Sew well from the back 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.920
 would be the front and back 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.050
 on each other and attach them with 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.650
 Do not pin so that the parts 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.650
 slip 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.390
 the first one twice with it 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.209
 stuck properly 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.910
 sew just at the edge and at each 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.940
 Make sure by both felt 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.550
 to sting 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.550
 Finally sew the thread well 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.370
