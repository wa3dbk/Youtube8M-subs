00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
commentaries and I make one and this is

commentaries and I make one and this is
actually<00:00:22.020> kind<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.619> tutorial<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.250> well<00:00:23.840> when

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
actually kind of a tutorial as well when

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
actually kind of a tutorial as well when
i<00:00:24.869> did<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.350> i<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.710> playing<00:00:26.300> referrals<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> i

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
i did this i was playing referrals and i

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.779 
i did this i was playing referrals and i
was<00:00:27.689> trying<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.369> warp<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.490> five

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
was trying to get the warp in five

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.030 
was trying to get the warp in five
zealots<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.960> hundred<00:00:31.199> fifty<00:00:31.289> seconds<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
zealots in two hundred fifty seconds I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
zealots in two hundred fifty seconds I
think<00:00:32.759> that's<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:34.730> 240<00:00:35.730> 250<00:00:36.180> second

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
think that's what it is 240 250 second

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.010 
think that's what it is 240 250 second
something<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> yeah<00:00:39.020> pretty

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
something like that and so yeah pretty

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.479 
something like that and so yeah pretty
easy<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.129> you're<00:00:41.370> having

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
easy actually but if you're having

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.869 
easy actually but if you're having
trouble<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> do

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
trouble with it this is what you can do

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.260 
trouble with it this is what you can do
so<00:00:45.600> yeah<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> pylon<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.829> nine<00:00:47.270> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so yeah just get the pylon at nine just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.590 
so yeah just get the pylon at nine just
the<00:00:48.510> standard<00:00:49.250> Protoss<00:00:50.250> opening<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the standard Protoss opening and I just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
the standard Protoss opening and I just
keep<00:00:54.780> getting<00:00:54.930> probes<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.219> well<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:58.789> get<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
keep getting probes as well I get the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
keep getting probes as well I get the
Gateway<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.600> ten<00:01:00.870> once<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.680> year<00:01:01.800> enough

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Gateway at ten once a year enough

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
Gateway at ten once a year enough
minerals<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:04.070> as<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.250> said<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.670> game<00:01:05.880> isn't

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
minerals and as I said this game isn't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.660 
minerals and as I said this game isn't
serious<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.900> free-for-all<00:01:07.500> man<00:01:07.770> rain<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
serious so free-for-all man rain so I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
serious so free-for-all man rain so I
didn't<00:01:09.030> send<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> scout<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.720> anything<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.439> was

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
didn't send a scout or anything I was

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
didn't send a scout or anything I was
basically<00:01:11.610> playing<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.210> bunch<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
basically playing a bunch of these just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
basically playing a bunch of these just
trying<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.159> because<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.520> usually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
trying to get this because I usually

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
trying to get this because I usually
don't<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.240> rush<00:01:15.509> builds<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.400> very

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
don't do rush builds so I'm not very

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.880 
don't do rush builds so I'm not very
good<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.330> second<00:01:19.229> gateway<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.680> 10

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
good at it and then second gateway at 10

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
good at it and then second gateway at 10
as<00:01:20.040> well<00:01:20.390> didn't<00:01:21.390> build<00:01:21.600> any<00:01:21.750> probes<00:01:22.110> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
as well didn't build any probes in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.420 
as well didn't build any probes in
between<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.400> first<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.119> gateways<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:25.430> hit

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
between the first two gateways just hit

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
between the first two gateways just hit
those<00:01:26.670> first<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.180> gateways<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.689> soon<00:01:27.840> as

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
those first two gateways as soon as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
those first two gateways as soon as
possible<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:29.850> basically<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
possible and then that's basically it I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.350 
possible and then that's basically it I
think<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> might<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:32.009> another<00:01:32.100> pile<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.700> but

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
think I might need another pile on but

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.859 
think I might need another pile on but
then<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.530> soon<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.890> these<00:01:35.070> warping<00:01:35.869> start

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
then just as soon as these warping start

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.010 
then just as soon as these warping start
making<00:01:37.170> zealots<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.420> corona<00:01:39.420> boost<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.900> out

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
making zealots and corona boost them out

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.760 
making zealots and corona boost them out
so<00:01:40.860> save<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.000> reasonable<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.110> reasonable

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so save up a reasonable a reasonable

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.330 
so save up a reasonable a reasonable
amount<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.399> common<00:01:44.970> boost

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.010 

yeah<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.729> as<00:01:49.000> soon<00:01:49.149> as<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:49.360> works<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:49.750> I'm<00:01:49.899> going

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
yeah so as soon as it works in I'm going

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.630 
yeah so as soon as it works in I'm going
to<00:01:50.079> start<00:01:50.229> making<00:01:50.380> adult<00:01:50.740> star<00:01:51.220> agusta

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
to start making adult star agusta

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.870 
to start making adult star agusta
killers<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.659> yeah<00:01:53.560> another<00:01:54.009> pile<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.490> when<00:01:54.850> i

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
killers and yeah another pile on when i

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.280 
killers and yeah another pile on when i
had<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> money<00:01:56.460> pretty<00:01:57.460> simple<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.290> i'll

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
had the money pretty simple and i'll

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.779 
had the money pretty simple and i'll
finish<00:01:59.590> eventually<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:02.350> might<00:02:03.340> end<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.640> video

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
finish eventually i might end the video

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.820 
finish eventually i might end the video
soon<00:02:04.479> i<00:02:04.780> thought<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.080> would<00:02:05.229> be<00:02:05.259> kind<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.680> a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
soon i thought this would be kind of a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.710 
soon i thought this would be kind of a
cool<00:02:06.250> video<00:02:06.399> show<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.299> can<00:02:07.390> see<00:02:07.570> it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
cool video show but as you can see it's

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.839 
cool video show but as you can see it's
21<00:02:08.229> minutes<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.679> i<00:02:08.739> actually<00:02:08.950> cast<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.610> once

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
21 minutes and i actually cast it once

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.350 
21 minutes and i actually cast it once
before<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.200> mike<00:02:11.590> problems<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:13.209> was

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
before this and mike problems but it was
