so<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.299> engine<00:01:49.399> 67<00:01:50.399> mpg<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.810> setup

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so this engine 67 mpg and this setup

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
so this engine 67 mpg and this setup
front-wheel<00:01:52.590> drive<00:01:52.619> stick<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> whole<00:01:53.670> thing

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
front-wheel drive stick the whole thing

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.440 
front-wheel drive stick the whole thing
now<00:01:54.810> European<00:01:55.770> cycle<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> different<00:01:57.240> than<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
now European cycle is different than a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
now European cycle is different than a
US<00:01:57.840> cycle<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.950> were<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.460> very

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
US cycle so if I were to use my very

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.179 
US cycle so if I were to use my very
fuzzy<00:02:00.210> math<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.020> abacus<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.649> we're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
fuzzy math and get my abacus out we're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.200 
fuzzy math and get my abacus out we're
talking<00:02:02.670> probably<00:02:03.210> mid<00:02:03.600> 50s<00:02:04.229> mpg<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.549> your

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
talking probably mid 50s mpg so your

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.499 
talking probably mid 50s mpg so your
choice<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.560> could<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.129> Chris<00:02:08.610> get

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
choice is you could do a Chris get

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.650 
choice is you could do a Chris get

getting it in hybrids obviously this car
a<00:02:32.890> diesel<00:02:33.430> will<00:02:33.790> shut<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.360> engine<00:02:34.690> down<00:02:34.720> add<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
a diesel will shut the engine down add a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.320 
a diesel will shut the engine down add a
light<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> it'll<00:02:36.670> still<00:02:36.910> run<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.210> air

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
light and it'll still run the air

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.120 
light and it'll still run the air
conditioning<00:02:37.870> which<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.380> really<00:02:38.680> amazing

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
conditioning which is really amazing

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.740 
conditioning which is really amazing
when<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.310> think<00:02:39.340> about<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.850> because<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.180> diesel

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
when you think about it because a diesel

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.230 
when you think about it because a diesel
by<00:02:41.380> nature<00:02:41.800> has<00:02:41.950> great<00:02:42.190> fuel<00:02:42.490> economy<00:02:42.640> and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
by nature has great fuel economy and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.660 
by nature has great fuel economy and
here's<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.110> really<00:02:44.350> simple<00:02:44.680> way<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.890> give

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
here's just a really simple way to give

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.530 
here's just a really simple way to give
you<00:02:45.880> maybe<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.360> couple<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.900> more<00:02:47.050> points<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.770> mpg

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you maybe a couple of more points of mpg

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.880 
you maybe a couple of more points of mpg
so<00:02:49.540> what's<00:02:49.720> really<00:02:49.840> amazing<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.770> is

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
so what's really amazing here is this is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.100 
so what's really amazing here is this is
a<00:02:50.920> front-wheel<00:02:51.340> drive<00:02:51.370> vehicle<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.600> I'm<00:02:52.780> able

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
a front-wheel drive vehicle and I'm able

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.440 
a front-wheel drive vehicle and I'm able
to<00:02:53.320> play<00:02:53.980> around<00:02:54.160> with<00:02:54.430> some<00:02:54.730> maneuvers<00:02:55.210> here

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
to play around with some maneuvers here

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.020 
to play around with some maneuvers here
on<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.750> disused<00:02:56.050> airfield<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.760> thing

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
on this disused airfield and this thing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.720 
on this disused airfield and this thing
isn't<00:02:58.300> disturbed<00:02:58.840> at<00:02:59.110> all<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.650> think<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.550> get<00:03:00.700> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
isn't disturbed at all I think you get a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.580 
isn't disturbed at all I think you get a
little<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.270> more<00:03:01.480> crispness<00:03:01.960> with<00:03:02.290> an<00:03:02.380> all

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
little bit more crispness with an all

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.150 
little bit more crispness with an all
wheel<00:03:02.770> drive<00:03:02.830> but<00:03:04.440> reality<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:05.830> what<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
wheel drive but reality is for what the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520 
wheel drive but reality is for what the
purpose<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.880> vehicle<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.570> I<00:03:07.900> mean<00:03:08.440> this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
purpose of this vehicle is I mean this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.700 
purpose of this vehicle is I mean this
is<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.800> compact<00:03:09.670> crossover<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.260> designed

like a stolen I don't know any other way
to<00:03:18.340> put<00:03:18.490> this<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.120> would<00:03:19.660> totally<00:03:19.900> own<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.410> I'm

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
to put this I would totally own this I'm

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.980 
to put this I would totally own this I'm
like<00:03:21.070> one<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.760> few<00:03:22.120> people<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.570> likes

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
the way the Juke looks I think I

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.840 
the way the Juke looks I think I
understand<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.080> stands<00:03:26.800> out<00:03:27.100> but<00:03:27.430> not<00:03:27.580> just

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
understand it it stands out but not just

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.640 
understand it it stands out but not just
because<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.240> wants<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> stand<00:03:28.840> out<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.380> stands

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
because it wants to stand out it stands

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.170 
because it wants to stand out it stands
out<00:03:29.770> because<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.160> such<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> unique<00:03:30.580> organic

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
out because it's such a unique organic

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.320 
out because it's such a unique organic
design<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.140> then<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.740> add<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.190> fact<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.550> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
design and then you add the fact that I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.880 
design and then you add the fact that I
can<00:03:34.690> get<00:03:34.810> some<00:03:34.960> pulling<00:03:35.200> power<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:35.770> my

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
can get some pulling power with my

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.150 
can get some pulling power with my
unique<00:03:36.160> design<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.850> think<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.480> need<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.660> try<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
unique design I think I need to try that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
unique design I think I need to try that
so<00:03:39.160> really<00:03:39.310> what<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:39.610> have<00:03:39.790> here<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.150> a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
so really what we have here is a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.410 
so really what we have here is a
question<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> GTD<00:03:42.310> film<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.209> buy

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
question like in the GTD film do you buy

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.750 
question like in the GTD film do you buy
your<00:03:43.600> car<00:03:43.810> by<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.020> pound<00:03:44.410> or<00:03:45.010> do<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.459> buy<00:03:45.610> your

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
your car by the pound or do you buy your

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.040 
your car by the pound or do you buy your
car<00:03:45.970> by<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.300> ounce

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
car by the ounce

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.590 
car by the ounce
now<00:03:47.620> I'm<00:03:48.100> not<00:03:48.430> your<00:03:48.670> financial<00:03:49.090> adviser<00:03:49.360> at

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
now I'm not your financial adviser at

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.680 
now I'm not your financial adviser at
least<00:03:49.810> today<00:03:50.110> but<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.400> car<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:52.270> a<00:03:52.300> turbo

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
least today but this car with a turbo

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.690 
least today but this car with a turbo
diesel<00:03:52.810> small<00:03:53.290> displacement<00:03:53.620> engine<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.220> not

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
diesel small displacement engine is not

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.540 
diesel small displacement engine is not
cheap<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:56.200> why<00:03:56.440> Nissan<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.040> kind<00:03:57.340> enough

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
cheap that's why Nissan is kind enough

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.090 
cheap that's why Nissan is kind enough
to<00:03:57.610> give<00:03:57.880> us<00:03:58.030> very<00:03:58.810> fancy<00:03:59.320> wheels<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.920> of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
to give us very fancy wheels and of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.880 
to give us very fancy wheels and of
course<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.970> requisite<00:04:01.380> manual<00:04:02.380> transmission

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
course the requisite manual transmission

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.130 
course the requisite manual transmission
so<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.459> question<00:04:04.000> now<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.420> how<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.780> we<00:04:04.930> get

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
so the question now is how do we get

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.370 
so the question now is how do we get
Nissan<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.860> bring<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.310> car<00:04:06.610> over<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.380> us

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
Nissan to bring this car over for us

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.710 
Nissan to bring this car over for us
poor<00:04:08.650> saps<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.250> US<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.670> drive<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.270> mean

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
poor saps in the US to drive I mean

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.320 
poor saps in the US to drive I mean
really<00:04:11.380> Nissan<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> contrarian<00:04:12.730> investor

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
really Nissan is the contrarian investor

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.060 
really Nissan is the contrarian investor
think<00:04:13.780> about<00:04:13.990> what<00:04:14.170> they've<00:04:14.320> brought<00:04:14.530> at<00:04:14.800> into

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
think about what they've brought at into

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.670 
think about what they've brought at into
their<00:04:15.220> full

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
their full

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.349 
their full
over<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.039> past<00:04:16.250> couple<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.609> years<00:04:16.669> you've<00:04:17.120> got

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
over the past couple of years you've got

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.719 
over the past couple of years you've got
a<00:04:17.660> brand<00:04:18.019> new<00:04:18.109> Z<00:04:18.410> when<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> economy<00:04:19.250> basically

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
a brand new Z when the economy basically

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.469 
a brand new Z when the economy basically
fell<00:04:19.880> off<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> cliff

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
fell off a cliff

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.770 
fell off a cliff
you<00:04:21.019> got<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.320> GTR<00:04:21.859> which<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.539> counter<00:04:23.539> to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
you got the GTR which is counter to

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.719 
you got the GTR which is counter to
anything<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.620> selling<00:04:24.919> right<00:04:25.100> now<00:04:25.130> it's

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
anything that is selling right now it's

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.390 
anything that is selling right now it's
still<00:04:25.940> wandering<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.300> car<00:04:26.509> and<00:04:27.020> if<00:04:27.860> that's

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
still wandering the car and if that's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.890 
still wandering the car and if that's
not<00:04:28.610> enough<00:04:28.729> proof<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:30.430> crossover<00:04:31.900> convertible

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
not enough proof a crossover convertible

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.260 
not enough proof a crossover convertible
so<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:33.830> anybody's<00:04:34.310> gonna<00:04:34.460> bring<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.850> car<00:04:35.060> like

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
so if anybody's gonna bring a car like

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.779 
so if anybody's gonna bring a car like
