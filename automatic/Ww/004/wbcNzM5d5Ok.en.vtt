00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Sun 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.860
 a technical tasting of beers 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 we need to take some care 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.070
 essential for example our condition 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.450
 may interfere with tasting if 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 we have the flu 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.380
 let's have our ability to perceive 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.570
 very compromised aromas 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.040
 the same way the pain in the environment 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.259
 smell the cigarette smell of food 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.450
 can also greatly interfere in this 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.220
 perception of these aromas our palate 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 is also influenced by foods that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.780
 we consumed before the tasting so 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 important to avoid eating strong foods 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.769
 very seasoned or seasoned before 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.660
 to do a beer tasting 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.329
 another factor that can also interfere 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.039
 in their perception are the glasses each 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.390
 Beer style asks for a glass with 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 different format 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 in the washing of the bodies is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 It is important to remove all types of fat. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 and leave no trace of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.550
 detergent when drying never use 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.800
 the plane can release lint 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 which impairs the formation of foam 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.970
 Another important tip is 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 tasting sequence to start with 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.760
 beers and finish with the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.100
 stronger 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 leaves the most bitter dark alcoholics 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 to the end 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.260
 each style of beer also requires a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 ritual at the time of service eg 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.210
 will sell wheat beer needs to be 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.050
 agitated at the end so that the yeast 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 let loose and be mixed with beer is a 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.530
 myth that needs to be undone is that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 the beers should be tasted 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 stupidly cold 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.260
 very cold beer has its 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 impaired foam formation 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.280
 in addition it cushions our 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 taste buds that our perception 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.380
 of flavors is compromised 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.360
 in general the smoother beers more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 should be tasted in a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.150
 temperature of 35 degrees and to be the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.600
 strong bitter alcoholics between 6 and 10 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.600
 degrees centigrade 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.700
 a tasting of our five beers 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.009
 senses are impacted first place 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.010
 hearing when we open a bottle of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.470
 beer the release of carbon dioxide 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.360
 this release will generate a noise and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.180
 This noise will tell us if beer 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.180
 is too carbonated or low carbonated 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 The next step is to analyze beer 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.820
 visually 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.510
 this way we can evaluate the foam of the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.180
 beer 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.280
 its density and persistence the color of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.770
 beer will define the type of malt 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.989
 barley that was used in the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.120
 example dark beers will indicate that 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.770
 The malts were used toasted 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.010
 aromas the beers will remember coffee 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.630
 chocolate roasting light beers 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.970
 indicate that mounts have been used 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.850
 cereals like wheat and 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.430
 barley another evaluation is with regard to 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.190
 turbidity to beer turbos 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.440
 indicate that it has not been filtered or that 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.239
 there is a production defect 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.130
 third step and perhaps the most 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.450
 important is the perception of aromas 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.130
 of beer 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.440
 we have the capacity to feel more than 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.560
 10,000 different aromas such as floral 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.900
 roasted citrus fruits and such 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.480
 aromas mixed with the flavors will form 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.440
 the taste that the beer presents has reached 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.989
 best part 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 drink the beer in our mouths let's detect 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.620
 the five basic tastes that beer 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.519
 the acid is bitter or sweet or 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.519
 salty and umami 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.880
 the beer through your whole mouth and 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.430
 allow your taste buds 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.020
 feel the five flavors in your mouth too 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.430
 through our armadillo 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.370
 let's realize four characteristics 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.840
 important of beer ended up swimming 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.790
 that the amount of carbon dioxide 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.280
 gift on beer 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.260
 the more carbonated beer the greater the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.310
 burning sensation that we feel 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.160
 in the tongue 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.920
 the body of the beer is very dense or 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.230
 the more the guard the denser the more 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.070
 but malt was used in the 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.890
 recipe 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.230
 we will also notice the temperature of the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.990
 beer is only too cold not only is it 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.210
 warmer and, finally, to distinguish 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.150
 that the sensation that hangs the sky 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.530
 like when we eat green bananas or 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 we drank a wine with many anonymous 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.000
 at the end of an after test that is the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.880
 set of flavors that remain in the mouth 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.890
 end of the tasting the perceptions are 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.850
 subjective and vary from person to person 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.650
 person 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.930
 The cool thing is that anyone can 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.580
 tasting a beer is not necessary 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.580
 be a good tasting specialist
