through<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.610> entire<00:04:04.060> interface<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.320> to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
through of the entire interface just to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.770 
through of the entire interface just to
kind<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:05.950> point<00:04:06.190> things<00:04:06.549> out<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.090> you

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
kind of point things out to you that you

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.360 
kind of point things out to you that you
know<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.870> little<00:04:08.080> bitty<00:04:08.260> pretty<00:04:08.320> icons<00:04:09.070> that

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
know a little bitty pretty icons that

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.430 
know a little bitty pretty icons that
may<00:04:09.790> seem<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.299> obvious<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:10.930> we<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.290> want

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
may seem to be obvious but we just want

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.930 
may seem to be obvious but we just want
to<00:04:11.500> make<00:04:11.590> sure<00:04:11.650> again<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.340> we're<00:04:12.700> all<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:12.820> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
to make sure again that we're all on the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.060 
to make sure again that we're all on the
same<00:04:13.030> page<00:04:13.450> from<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.989> very<00:04:14.170> get<00:04:14.350> go<00:04:14.410> then

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
same page from the very get go then

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.590 
same page from the very get go then
we're<00:04:15.190> going<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.370> take<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.549> look<00:04:15.760> at<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.060> setup

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
we're going to take a look at the setup

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.550 
we're going to take a look at the setup
process<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.560> making<00:04:18.220> sure<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.760> all<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.989> t's

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
process of making sure that all the t's

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.320 
process of making sure that all the t's
across<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.340> I's<00:04:21.459> are<00:04:21.489> dotted<00:04:21.760> on<00:04:22.180> the

across and the I's are dotted on the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.570 
across and the I's are dotted on the
same<00:04:22.630> way<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.710> as<00:04:24.070> you're<00:04:24.310> progressing

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580

through<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.360> video<00:04:25.690> tutorial<00:04:25.930> you'll<00:04:26.890> know

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
through this video tutorial you'll know

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.580 
through this video tutorial you'll know
that<00:04:27.520> your<00:04:27.970> system<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.660> set<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:28.990> same<00:04:29.080> as

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
that your system is set up the same as

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.159 
that your system is set up the same as
mine<00:04:30.100> now<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:31.030> course<00:04:31.330> there's<00:04:31.660> other<00:04:31.930> ways

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
mine now of course there's other ways

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.800 
mine now of course there's other ways
this<00:04:32.500> can<00:04:32.680> be<00:04:32.800> tackled<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:33.880> you<00:04:34.390> know<00:04:34.510> hey

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
this can be tackled but you know hey

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.330 
this can be tackled but you know hey
it's<00:04:35.080> my<00:04:35.229> video<00:04:35.500> series<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:35.979> we're<00:04:36.130> going<00:04:36.250> to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
it's my video series so we're going to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.159 
it's my video series so we're going to
do<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.460> this<00:04:36.520> way<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.030> once<00:04:37.840> you're<00:04:37.990> more

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
do it this way and once you're more

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.100 
do it this way and once you're more
familiar<00:04:38.320> with<00:04:38.680> composer<00:04:39.220> as<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:40.030> program<00:04:40.570> then

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
familiar with composer as a program then

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.290 
familiar with composer as a program then
you'll<00:04:41.440> be<00:04:41.560> able<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.860> set

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
you'll be able to set

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.909 
you'll be able to set
to<00:04:42.509> meet<00:04:42.659> your<00:04:42.870> personal<00:04:43.110> wants<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.740> needs

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
to meet your personal wants and needs

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.249 
to meet your personal wants and needs
then<00:04:44.819> after<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.150> get<00:04:45.270> our<00:04:45.419> program<00:04:45.870> set<00:04:46.229> up

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
then after we get our program set up

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.300 
then after we get our program set up
we're<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> get<00:04:46.889> down<00:04:47.069> on<00:04:47.099> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
we're going to get down on the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.029 
we're going to get down on the
nitty-gritty<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.000> start<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.780> work<00:04:49.020> first<00:04:49.830> off

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
nitty-gritty and start to work first off

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.529 
nitty-gritty and start to work first off
we're<00:04:50.250> going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.550> learn<00:04:50.789> how<00:04:50.849> to<00:04:51.030> create<00:04:51.509> a

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
we're going to learn how to create a

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.159 
we're going to learn how to create a
multi-column<00:04:52.440> layout<00:04:53.599> then<00:04:54.599> we're<00:04:54.840> going<00:04:54.990> to

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
multi-column layout then we're going to

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.939 
multi-column layout then we're going to
learn<00:04:55.319> how<00:04:55.379> to<00:04:55.530> insert<00:04:56.159> data<00:04:56.610> tables<00:04:57.949> and

learn how to insert data tables and

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.820 
learn how to insert data tables and
probably<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.940> media<00:05:00.720> stove<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.259> videos<00:05:01.590> in

they're all their own but I felt they

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.800 
they're all their own but I felt they
were<00:05:35.039> worth<00:05:35.219> mentioning<00:05:35.909> in<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.599> particular

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
were worth mentioning in this particular

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.649 
were worth mentioning in this particular
series<00:05:37.409> because<00:05:37.979> it's<00:05:38.610> an<00:05:38.759> add-on<00:05:39.000> not<00:05:39.539> so

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
series because it's an add-on not so

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.659 
series because it's an add-on not so
much<00:05:39.750> an<00:05:39.870> add-on<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:40.319> it's<00:05:40.500> it's<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.430> feature

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
much an add-on but it's it's a feature

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.869 
much an add-on but it's it's a feature
that<00:05:41.789> composer<00:05:42.330> has<00:05:42.719> that<00:05:43.020> really<00:05:43.319> i<00:05:43.879> really

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
that composer has that really i really

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.939 
that composer has that really i really
enjoy<00:05:45.449> because<00:05:45.719> it's<00:05:46.139> something<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.529> a<00:05:46.680> lot

of other WYSIWYG editors that cost money

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.879 
of other WYSIWYG editors that cost money
do<00:05:50.310> not<00:05:50.520> have<00:05:50.880> built-in<00:05:51.449> composer<00:05:52.259> does<00:05:52.590> and

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
do not have built-in composer does and

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.620 
do not have built-in composer does and
that<00:05:53.009> is<00:05:53.159> dealing<00:05:53.550> with<00:05:53.669> cascading<00:05:54.240> style

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
that is dealing with cascading style

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.320 
that is dealing with cascading style
sheets<00:05:54.990> so<00:05:55.830> we're<00:05:56.190> going<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.669> dedicate<00:05:56.880> at

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330
