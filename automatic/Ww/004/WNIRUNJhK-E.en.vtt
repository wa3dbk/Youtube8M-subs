Corsa D 2006 onwards to change your
coolant<00:00:20.910> temperature<00:00:21.300> sensor<00:00:21.330> you'll<00:00:21.779> only

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
coolant temperature sensor you'll only

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.740 
coolant temperature sensor you'll only
need<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.230> couple<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.680> tools<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> you

need a couple of tools and so you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
need a couple of tools and so you
obviously<00:00:25.289> new<00:00:25.619> coolant<00:00:26.310> temperature<00:00:26.640> sensor

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
obviously new coolant temperature sensor

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.290 
obviously new coolant temperature sensor
which<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:29.090> that's<00:00:30.090> what

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
which is this one here and that's what

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.410 
which is this one here and that's what
they<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> will<00:00:32.790> need<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
they look like and you will need a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
they look like and you will need a
ratchet<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:36.360> will

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
ratchet which is that one there you will

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560 
ratchet which is that one there you will
need<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> 19<00:00:37.320> millimeter<00:00:37.500> deep<00:00:38.100> socket<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.390> get

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
need a 19 millimeter deep socket to get

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
need a 19 millimeter deep socket to get
over<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.290> coolant<00:00:40.649> temperature<00:00:41.010> sensor<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
over the coolant temperature sensor and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
over the coolant temperature sensor and
you<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.239> need<00:00:42.420> an<00:00:42.570> extension<00:00:43.020> bar<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you will need an extension bar and to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
you will need an extension bar and to
attach<00:00:44.700> onto<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.200> okay<00:00:46.200> without<00:00:46.350> further

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
attach onto that okay without further

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
attach onto that okay without further
ado<00:00:46.920> I'll<00:00:47.160> show<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:50.750> okay<00:00:51.750> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
ado I'll show you how to do it okay so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
ado I'll show you how to do it okay so
this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> location<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> coolant

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this is the location of the coolant

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.740 
this is the location of the coolant
temperature<00:00:54.809> sensor<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> didn't<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.039> I

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
temperature sensor if you didn't know I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.349 
temperature sensor if you didn't know I
take<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.989> airbox<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.210> get

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
take my airbox off just so and I can get

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
take my airbox off just so and I can get
a<00:01:00.390> better<00:01:00.539> camera<00:01:00.750> angle<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> show<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
a better camera angle to show you how to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
a better camera angle to show you how to
take<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.579> off<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> change<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
take it on and off when I change the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
take it on and off when I change the
camera<00:01:03.719> angle<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.280> I'll<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
camera angle and for what I'll do now is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
camera angle and for what I'll do now is
I'll<00:01:05.820> zoom<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> actual<00:01:06.960> core<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.290> 10%

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
I'll zoom in on the actual core and 10%

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'll zoom in on the actual core and 10%
adjust<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> can't<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.880> pointing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
adjust you can't see what I'm pointing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.929 
adjust you can't see what I'm pointing
to<00:01:12.650> okay<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> zoomed<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.729> that's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to okay so this is it zoomed in that's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.770 
to okay so this is it zoomed in that's
the<00:01:15.090> coolant<00:01:15.420> temperature<00:01:15.570> sensor<00:01:15.840> bar<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the coolant temperature sensor bar and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
the coolant temperature sensor bar and
so<00:01:18.780> firstly<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.320> you've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so firstly what you've got to do is just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
so firstly what you've got to do is just
will<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.850> clip<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
will be a little clip on it just got to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.310 
will be a little clip on it just got to
clip<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> off<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.630> come<00:01:24.930> off

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
clip it off there and it will come off

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
clip it off there and it will come off
sometimes<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> give<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
sometimes you do have to give it a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.190 
sometimes you do have to give it a
little<00:01:26.880> bit<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.119> force<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:30.869> pop<00:01:31.020> off

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
little bit of force and it will pop off

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.850 
little bit of force and it will pop off
like<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:33.259> that's<00:01:34.259> basically<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
like that and then that's basically it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.550 
like that and then that's basically it
there<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> ratchet<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
there I'll just get the ratchet and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.160 
there I'll just get the ratchet and
extension<00:01:37.619> bar<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> we'll<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> off

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
extension bar and we'll then get it off

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.120 
extension bar and we'll then get it off
okay<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> ratchet<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:43.920> something

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay so the ratchet will look something

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
okay so the ratchet will look something
like<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.049> I'll<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.229> zoom<00:01:46.439> back<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
like this and I'll just zoom back to the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.500 
like this and I'll just zoom back to the
car<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> I'll<00:01:48.420> show<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> how<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> take<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> off

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.050 

okay<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.590> how<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.770> take<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.100> off<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
okay so this is how you take it off you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.790 
okay so this is how you take it off you
put<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.330> extension<00:01:56.540> match<00:01:56.870> it<00:01:57.140> over<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.650> like

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
put the extension match it over it like

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.620 
put the extension match it over it like
that<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.280> wiggle<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.670> around<00:01:58.760> until<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.360> gets

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that just wiggle it around until it gets

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.880 
that just wiggle it around until it gets
into<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.820> on<00:02:01.820> top<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.890> temperature

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
into the on top of the temperature

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.320 
into the on top of the temperature
sensor<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.430> then<00:02:04.970> what<00:02:05.090> you're<00:02:05.180> going<00:02:05.270> to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
sensor and then what you're going to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.670 
sensor and then what you're going to
want<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.540> do<00:02:05.720> you're<00:02:06.020> just<00:02:06.230> going<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.470> want<00:02:06.560> to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
want to do you're just going to want to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.980 
want to do you're just going to want to
twist<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.250> ratchet<00:02:07.640> thing<00:02:08.450> off<00:02:08.690> nice<00:02:08.960> and

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
twist the ratchet thing off nice and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
how you change the coolant temperature

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.509 
how you change the coolant temperature
