00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I felt so bad I was also like 15 or 16

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
I felt so bad I was also like 15 or 16
years<00:01:30.810> old<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.320> felt<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.130> bad<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.790> said<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
years old I felt so bad that I said that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
years old I felt so bad that I said that
but<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.840> cool<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.350> cuz<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
but he was really cool with it cuz you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
but he was really cool with it cuz you
know<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.400> talked<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.150> him<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.630> he

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
know I talked more about him about he

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.969 
know I talked more about him about he
was<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.049> oh<00:01:37.140> whatever

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
was just like oh whatever

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.260 
was just like oh whatever
you're<00:01:38.220> adopted<00:01:38.640> whatever<00:01:39.000> doesn't<00:01:39.180> matter

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you're adopted whatever doesn't matter

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
you're adopted whatever doesn't matter
so<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.840> thought<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> myself<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so I thought to myself like what if I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889 
so I thought to myself like what if I
found<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.909> adopted<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.479> honestly<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
found out I was adopted and honestly I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.090 
found out I was adopted and honestly I
don't<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.619> care<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
don't think I would really care that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
don't think I would really care that
much<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.970> common<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
much it's actually very common that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
much it's actually very common that
babies<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.140> switched<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.740> while<00:01:47.310> they're

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
babies do get switched up while they're

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
babies do get switched up while they're
in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> hospital<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.840> code

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
in the hospital and like they get code

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.090 
in the hospital and like they get code
with<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> wrong<00:01:49.500> pants<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:49.860> something<00:01:50.040> like

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
with the wrong pants or something like

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
with the wrong pants or something like
that<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.790> happen<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.210> anyone<00:01:51.720> literally

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that that can happen to anyone literally

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.510 
that that can happen to anyone literally
anyone<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> doesn't<00:01:53.070> matter<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> wouldn't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
anyone it doesn't matter you wouldn't

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
anyone it doesn't matter you wouldn't
even<00:01:53.579> notice<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.299> guess<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:54.810> find

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
even notice I guess when you would find

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.789 
even notice I guess when you would find
out<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.350> grow<00:01:55.560> up

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
out when they grow up

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
out when they grow up
but<00:01:56.549> that's<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.909> teen<00:01:57.090> years<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.719> not

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
but that's in a teen years so that's not

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
but that's in a teen years so that's not
your<00:01:58.110> problem<00:01:58.200> by<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.280> found<00:01:59.460> out

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
your problem by then but if I found out

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130
