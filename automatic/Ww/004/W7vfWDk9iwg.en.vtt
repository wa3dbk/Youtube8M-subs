 once again today we are going to make a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.640
 different tutorial since we're in the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.090
 halloween time 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.270
 Of nails 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.860
 well I will show you slowly what 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.140
 are the manicures that we are going to do today 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.580
 but they are obviously halloween if 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.830
 you like to give your fingers up 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.790
 leave me a comment and this time 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.590
 in the manicure the echo veronica although 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.600
 I'm going to tell you the step by step but 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.730
 she has done it so if you want to see 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.190
 What are the options that I present to you? 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.739
 for this manicure halloween stay 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.960
 watching let's start with the first 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.660
 manicures that are very vampires 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.460
 funny let's start by taking a 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 nail polish white and let's apply it 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.660
 as a basis for all the nails in this 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.550
 case I'm going to apply two layers so that 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 stay solid when you are 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.750
 completely dry pick up a nail polish 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 black and a finite brush and we're going to 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 start creating the first the design goes 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.230
 to be of the hair 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.220
 the trick is going to be to create a kind of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.290
 crescent flush with the cuticles then 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 we can swell them if we want and what 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's create a triangular species 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.660
 right in the center that will be the effect 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 then of the hair of entrance of the hair 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.190
 that has in mind dracula with a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 We are going to create two dots that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.050
 will be the eyes with the same brush 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 above we are going to create two lines on top 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.180
 of the eyes that are the eyebrows a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 hairline and a couple of triangles 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 what are the fangs and we are going to finish 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.940
 with the book with the same punch we are going to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 create the details of the eyes in red and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.009
 over white 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 and with white in the fangs and that's it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.479
 our calculate this finish is what 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 nice that says cool the second 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 Manicure option are some skulls 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.110
 very funny we started applying in two 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.299
 of the nails a white base in this case 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 two layers to create the solid good and in 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.350
 the rest of the nails I will use a lacquer 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.450
 black and I'm going to apply it also as 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.090
 base once we have the nails 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.899
 completely dry with black lacquer 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.000
 I have just needed a single layer 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.530
 we take the white and in the nails with base 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 black we're going to start creating with a 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.329
 tiny brush some parallel lines 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.060
 you can create between 5 or 6 and now with the 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.130
 black nail lacquer base nails 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.519
 White will take a punch and start 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.010
 to create the eyes are two holes with 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.870
 this form then with the brush we are going to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.150
 create two small parallel lines that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.099
 will be the principles of the nose and with 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.410
 this same brush we are going to create a 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.450
 crescent flush with the nail that will be the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.980
 mouth and we will create a few lines 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.810
 crossing the whole mouth 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.849
 in both options we will finish the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.940
 manicures with a transparent layer for 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.620
 that lasts much longer the manicure I hope 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.940
 that you liked to tell me which of the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
 two options is the one that has liked the most 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.920
