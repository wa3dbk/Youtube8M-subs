a<00:00:01.469> sample<00:00:02.429> chapter<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.060> ecology

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.380 
a sample chapter from ecology

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.790 
a sample chapter from ecology
had<00:00:05.500> a<00:00:05.530> brain<00:00:05.800> scan

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 
had a brain scan

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.920 
had a brain scan
I<00:00:07.860> think<00:00:08.430> the<00:00:08.520> brain<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> weirdest<00:00:09.720> thing

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
I think the brain is the weirdest thing

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.810 
I think the brain is the weirdest thing
in<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> body<00:00:10.350> it's<00:00:11.310> probably<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> ugliest

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
in the body it's probably the ugliest

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.840 
in the body it's probably the ugliest
thing<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.420> well

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
thing as well

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.520 
thing as well
I<00:00:13.940> don't<00:00:14.450> feel<00:00:14.570> bad<00:00:14.780> about<00:00:14.930> saying<00:00:15.260> that

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
I don't feel bad about saying that

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.960 
I don't feel bad about saying that
because<00:00:15.860> it's<00:00:16.070> my<00:00:16.160> brain<00:00:16.340> that<00:00:16.370> came<00:00:16.700> up<00:00:16.730> with

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
because it's my brain that came up with

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.270 
because it's my brain that came up with
it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
it

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.280 
it
it<00:00:18.430> doesn't<00:00:18.730> learn<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:18.970> look<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.210> itself<00:00:19.510> so

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
it doesn't learn the look of itself so

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.870 
it doesn't learn the look of itself so
the<00:00:20.380> point<00:00:20.410> I<00:00:20.740> tells<00:00:21.040> me<00:00:21.190> not<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.340> eat<00:00:21.490> anything

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
the point I tells me not to eat anything

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.510 
the point I tells me not to eat anything
that<00:00:22.180> looks<00:00:22.390> like<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.600> brain<00:00:22.900> either<00:00:23.170> I<00:00:23.520> don't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
that looks like a brain either I don't

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.890 
that looks like a brain either I don't
like<00:00:24.610> cauliflower<00:00:25.030> because<00:00:25.510> that's<00:00:25.660> kind<00:00:25.810> of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
like cauliflower because that's kind of

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.750 
like cauliflower because that's kind of
brain<00:00:26.110> looking<00:00:26.440> and<00:00:26.620> I've<00:00:27.190> always<00:00:27.340> got<00:00:27.550> rid<00:00:27.700> of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
brain looking and I've always got rid of

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.370 
brain looking and I've always got rid of
the<00:00:27.880> wall<00:00:28.030> off<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.450> top<00:00:28.690> of<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.870> walnut<00:00:29.020> whipped

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
the wall off the top of a walnut whipped

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.880 
the wall off the top of a walnut whipped
before<00:00:29.560> eating<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:30.990> I've<00:00:31.990> wondered<00:00:32.380> if<00:00:32.560> I'm<00:00:32.740> in

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
before eating it I've wondered if I'm in

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.500 
before eating it I've wondered if I'm in
charge<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.430> brain<00:00:33.670> or<00:00:33.910> if<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.270> brain<00:00:34.480> is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
charge of the brain or if the brain is

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.620 
charge of the brain or if the brain is
in<00:00:34.750> charge<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:35.170> me<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:36.640> her<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:36.790> better<00:00:36.970> Thor<00:00:37.330> and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
in charge of me as her a better Thor and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.210 
in charge of me as her a better Thor and
people<00:00:38.200> watching<00:00:38.380> I<00:00:38.710> came<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.190> conclusion

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
people watching I came to the conclusion

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.420 
people watching I came to the conclusion
that<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.330> brain<00:00:40.540> that's<00:00:40.750> in<00:00:40.960> charge<00:00:41.430> he

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
that is the brain that's in charge he

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.650 
that is the brain that's in charge he
came<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:42.730> me<00:00:42.940> when<00:00:43.090> I<00:00:43.150> saw<00:00:43.330> some<00:00:43.510> people

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
came to me when I saw some people

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.570 
came to me when I saw some people
getting<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.379> push<00:00:44.559> bikes<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.400> first

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
getting on the push bikes the first

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.040 
getting on the push bikes the first
thing<00:00:45.820> they<00:00:45.910> did<00:00:46.059> was<00:00:46.270> put<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.660> bike<00:00:46.780> helmet

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
thing they did was put on a bike helmet

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.020 
thing they did was put on a bike helmet
which<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.040> me<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> sign<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.790> brain<00:00:49.000> is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
which to me is a sign that the brain is

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.479 
which to me is a sign that the brain is
just<00:00:49.390> looking<00:00:49.660> after<00:00:49.900> itself<00:00:50.200> you<00:00:51.070> don't<00:00:51.280> tell

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
just looking after itself you don't tell

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.250 
just looking after itself you don't tell
you<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.730> look<00:00:52.239> after<00:00:52.420> your<00:00:52.660> knees<00:00:52.839> or<00:00:53.140> your

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
you to look after your knees or your

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.140 
you to look after your knees or your
elbows<00:00:53.620> by<00:00:53.650> wearing<00:00:54.070> pads<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:54.820> tells<00:00:55.030> you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
elbows by wearing pads it just tells you

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.990 
elbows by wearing pads it just tells you
to<00:00:55.269> look<00:00:55.360> after<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.129> that's<00:00:57.730> why<00:00:57.909> I<00:00:57.940> think

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
to look after it so that's why I think

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.649 
to look after it so that's why I think
the<00:00:58.239> brain<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.570> in<00:00:58.690> charge<00:00:59.730> manju<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:01.330> wants<00:01:01.570> me

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
the brain is in charge manju it wants me

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.470 
the brain is in charge manju it wants me
to<00:01:01.780> think<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:03.190> not<00:01:04.030> thinking<00:01:04.420> about

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
to think that I'm not thinking about

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.660 
to think that I'm not thinking about
your<00:01:04.750> brain<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.260> isn't<00:01:05.860> always<00:01:05.950> interested<00:01:06.640> in

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
your brain it isn't always interested in

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.940 
your brain it isn't always interested in
the<00:01:06.790> same<00:01:06.940> things<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:07.480> me<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:07.840> can<00:01:08.620> enjoy

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950

brain<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> bit<00:01:26.380> like<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> backup<00:01:27.219> drive<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.700> you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
brain a bit like a backup drive that you

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.720 
brain a bit like a backup drive that you
have<00:01:27.880> for<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.090> computer

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
have for a computer

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.480 
have for a computer
anyway<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.840> didn't<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.620> that<00:01:31.740> well<00:01:31.800> in<00:01:31.980> me<00:01:32.160> exams

at school so I decided to take a Mensa
test<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.190> save<00:01:35.340> me<00:01:35.490> brain<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.940> any

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
test to save me brain have got any

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
life

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.800 
life
the<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.280> odd<00:03:24.490> thing<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:24.820> none<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
the really odd thing was none of the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.020 
the really odd thing was none of the
people<00:03:26.200> taking<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.830> test<00:03:27.070> ever<00:03:27.370> seen<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.820> laugh

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
people taking a test ever seen to laugh

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.090 
people taking a test ever seen to laugh
which<00:03:28.480> made<00:03:28.930> me<00:03:29.050> wonder<00:03:29.080> if<00:03:29.470> intelligent

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
which made me wonder if intelligent

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.760 
which made me wonder if intelligent
people<00:03:30.430> need<00:03:30.760> laughter<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.560> thought<00:03:32.560> about

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
people need laughter I thought about

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.710 
people need laughter I thought about
this<00:03:32.980> on<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.130> way<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.460> maybe<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.510> brain

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
this on the way on maybe the brain

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560 
this on the way on maybe the brain
doesn't<00:03:35.020> really<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.500> laughing<00:03:36.120> mad<00:03:37.120> people

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
doesn't really like laughing mad people

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.150 
doesn't really like laughing mad people
who<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:38.020> faults<00:03:38.410> with<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.590> brain<00:03:38.800> laugh<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
who have faults with the brain laugh a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.700 
who have faults with the brain laugh a
lot<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.420> babies<00:03:40.420> ooze<00:03:40.570> doesn't<00:03:41.260> grow<00:03:41.410> knock

lot and babies ooze doesn't grow knock

lot and babies ooze doesn't grow knock
like<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> good<00:03:42.310> laugh<00:03:42.520> but<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.880> seems<00:03:43.120> that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
like a good laugh but it seems that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.820 
like a good laugh but it seems that
normal<00:03:43.750> brains<00:03:43.990> don't<00:03:44.800> really<00:03:45.070> like<00:03:45.250> laughing

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
normal brains don't really like laughing

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.710 
normal brains don't really like laughing
I<00:03:46.890> got<00:03:47.610> me<00:03:47.700> man<00:03:47.850> see<00:03:48.000> results<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.420> few<00:03:48.630> weeks

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
I got me man see results a few weeks

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.370 
I got me man see results a few weeks
later<00:03:48.990> they<00:03:49.980> were<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.160> joke<00:03:50.480> but<00:03:51.480> again<00:03:51.750> my

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
later they were a joke but again my

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.580 
later they were a joke but again my
brain<00:03:52.620> didn't<00:03:52.860> laugh

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
brain didn't laugh

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.979 
brain didn't laugh
I<00:03:54.680> decided<00:03:55.370> for<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:55.819> chapter<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.780> would

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
I decided for this chapter that it would

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.240 
I decided for this chapter that it would
be<00:03:57.080> good<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> have<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.500> picture<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.860> my<00:03:58.010> brain

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
be good to have a picture of my brain

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.130 
be good to have a picture of my brain
because<00:03:58.519> at<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.060> end<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.390> day<00:03:59.569> it's<00:03:59.810> that

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
because at the end of the day it's that

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.630 
because at the end of the day it's that
that's<00:04:00.379> come<00:04:00.620> up<00:04:00.650> with<00:04:00.890> what<00:04:01.220> I'm<00:04:01.310> telling<00:04:01.610> you

some<00:04:07.970> good<00:04:08.150> shots<00:04:08.390> on<00:04:08.629> your<00:04:08.780> brain<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.760> like<00:04:10.760> to

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
some good shots on your brain I like to

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.330 
some good shots on your brain I like to
think<00:04:11.060> about<00:04:11.360> me<00:04:11.480> brain<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> lot<00:04:12.110> which<00:04:12.680> proves

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
think about me brain a lot which proves

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.369 
think about me brain a lot which proves
it<00:04:13.549> also<00:04:13.849> loves<00:04:14.150> itself<00:04:14.540> as<00:04:14.720> well<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.049> being<00:04:15.230> in

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
it also loves itself as well as being in

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.289 
it also loves itself as well as being in
charge<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.220> can't<00:04:16.760> get<00:04:16.880> me<00:04:16.970> head<00:04:17.000> around

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
charge but I can't get me head around

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.229 
charge but I can't get me head around
how<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.690> brain<00:04:18.019> was<00:04:18.380> created<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:20.030> grasp

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
how the brain was created I can grasp

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.090 
how the brain was created I can grasp
out<00:04:20.510> humans<00:04:21.139> might<00:04:21.350> have<00:04:21.470> developed<00:04:21.620> from

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
out humans might have developed from

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.280 
out humans might have developed from
fish<00:04:22.370> over<00:04:22.699> time<00:04:22.910> but<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> brain<00:04:24.020> bit

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
fish over time but it's the brain bit

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.469 
fish over time but it's the brain bit
that<00:04:24.440> gets<00:04:24.680> me<00:04:24.889> see<00:04:25.550> scientists<00:04:26.090> always<00:04:26.210> use

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
that gets me see scientists always use

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.090 
that gets me see scientists always use
the<00:04:26.510> evolution<00:04:27.290> argument<00:04:27.770> when<00:04:27.889> they<00:04:28.010> don't

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the evolution argument when they don't

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.710 
the evolution argument when they don't
know<00:04:28.310> things<00:04:28.700> have<00:04:28.850> grown<00:04:28.970> an<00:04:29.240> extra<00:04:29.330> layer

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720

what see I have this theory that the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.440 
what see I have this theory that the

planet where brains ruled a planet where

planet where brains ruled a planet where
there<00:04:42.530> was<00:04:42.650> no<00:04:42.800> atmosphere<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:44.450> brain

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
there was no atmosphere and the brain

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.240 
there was no atmosphere and the brain
she's<00:04:44.900> floating<00:04:45.200> around<00:04:45.410> thinking<00:04:46.100> about

Planet Earth but found that they were
