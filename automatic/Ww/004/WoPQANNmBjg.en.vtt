the like Edisto d3a bt is additionally

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.039 
the like Edisto d3a bt is additionally
equipped<00:03:50.480> with<00:03:50.780> Bluetooth<00:03:51.040> technology

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.149 

measurement<00:03:57.049> results<00:03:57.560> can<00:03:57.799> be<00:03:57.829> wirelessly

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
measurement results can be wirelessly

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.210 
measurement results can be wirelessly
and<00:03:58.849> accurately<00:03:59.450> transferred<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.290> pocket<00:04:00.739> PCs
