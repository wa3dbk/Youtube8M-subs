bacteria<00:00:34.370> have<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> heard<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.300> phrase

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
bacteria have you heard of the phrase

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.319 
bacteria have you heard of the phrase
there's<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> fungus<00:00:37.559> among<00:00:37.739> us<00:00:38.040> okay<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
there's the fungus among us okay it is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's the fungus among us okay it is
so<00:00:39.540> true<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:40.260> bodies<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:40.980> made<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so true our bodies are made up of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270 
so true our bodies are made up of
trillions<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.540> trillions<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:43.200> bacteria<00:00:43.320> even

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
trillions and trillions of bacteria even

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
trillions and trillions of bacteria even
more<00:00:44.489> cells<00:00:44.910> than<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.530> are

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
more cells than we have and they are

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.860 
more cells than we have and they are
very<00:00:46.800> necessary<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.550> different<00:00:48.149> processes

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
very necessary for different processes

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
very necessary for different processes
that<00:00:49.379> happen<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.800> our<00:00:49.920> body<00:00:50.219> our<00:00:50.520> body<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that happen with our body our body is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
that happen with our body our body is
constantly<00:00:51.329> trying<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.110> keep<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.530> healthy

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
constantly trying to keep a healthy

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.990 
constantly trying to keep a healthy
balance<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> good<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> bad<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
antibiotics in particular take out a lot

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
antibiotics in particular take out a lot
of<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.300> good<00:01:00.480> along<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> bad<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:02.520> not

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
going to go into my detail about

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
going to go into my detail about
bacteria<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> video<00:01:07.320> I'll<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.040> more

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
bacteria in this video I'll go into more

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
bacteria in this video I'll go into more
detail<00:01:08.490> later<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> focus

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
detail later but I really want to focus

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.700 
detail later but I really want to focus
on<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> restore<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.360> bacteria<00:01:12.960> back<00:01:13.409> into

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
on how to restore the bacteria back into

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
on how to restore the bacteria back into
your<00:01:13.830> body<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:15.180> four<00:01:15.540> waves<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> them

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
your body so there's four waves of them

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.969 
your body so there's four waves of them
discussed<00:01:16.590> today<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.130> first<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.979> eat

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
discussed today the first one is to eat

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
discussed today the first one is to eat
yogurt<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.720> particular<00:01:21.720> yogurt<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.470> live

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
yogurt in particular yogurt with live

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
yogurt in particular yogurt with live
active<00:01:23.490> cultures<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.210> means<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> say<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
active cultures it means to say that on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.969 
active cultures it means to say that on
the<00:01:25.979> label<00:01:26.479> that's<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> help<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the label that's going to help get that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.700 
the label that's going to help get that
back<00:01:29.270> good<00:01:30.270> bacteria<00:01:30.509> back<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.470> system

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
back good bacteria back into your system

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
back good bacteria back into your system
eat<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> cup<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> day<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.630> least<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
eat about a cup a day for at least a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
eat about a cup a day for at least a
week<00:01:34.140> after<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:35.180> antibiotic<00:01:36.180> series

week after you have an antibiotic series

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.109 
week after you have an antibiotic series
I<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.799> say<00:01:38.040> more<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.520> than<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I would say more time than that but it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
I would say more time than that but it
leaves<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.570> week<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.259> even<00:01:40.380> eat<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.619> while

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
leaves a week you can even eat it while

energy level so having the bacteria I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920 
energy level so having the bacteria I
just<00:03:25.130> mentioned<00:03:25.459> three<00:03:25.700> things<00:03:25.730> but<00:03:26.269> there<00:03:26.420> it
