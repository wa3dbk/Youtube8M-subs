to<00:01:43.470> grab<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.490> need<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> conceal

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to grab I don't really need to conceal

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
to grab I don't really need to conceal
my<00:01:45.090> knife<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
my knife that much more I do like the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
my knife that much more I do like the
shape<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.880> pocket<00:01:48.270> clip<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> how<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
shape of this pocket clip and how it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
shape of this pocket clip and how it
functions<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
functions I think that's more of a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
functions I think that's more of a
concern<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.049> how<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> pocket<00:01:53.159> clip

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
concern for me is how the pocket clip

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.539 
concern for me is how the pocket clip
functions<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.689> against<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> handle<00:01:55.590> how

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
functions up against the handle how

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.370 
functions up against the handle how
springy<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.299> how<00:01:57.509> tight<00:01:57.810> does<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> keep<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
springy it is how tight does it keep the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.450 
springy it is how tight does it keep the
knife<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.860> pocket

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
