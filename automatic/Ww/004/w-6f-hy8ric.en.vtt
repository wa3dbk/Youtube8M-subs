00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
victory that Ronnie put on him 18:8 a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.450 
victory that Ronnie put on him 18:8 a
belief<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.420> I<00:04:55.020> don't<00:04:55.410> think<00:04:55.620> it'll<00:04:55.920> be<00:04:56.010> that

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
belief and I don't think it'll be that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.630 
belief and I don't think it'll be that
much<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:57.060> gap<00:04:57.600> at<00:04:58.500> all<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:58.950> what<00:04:59.520> we're

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
much of a gap at all and what we're

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.210 
much of a gap at all and what we're
going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.790> find<00:04:59.970> out<00:05:00.240> from<00:05:00.420> ally<00:05:00.600> Carter<00:05:01.220> is

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
going to find out from ally Carter is

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.400 
going to find out from ally Carter is
how<00:05:02.460> strong<00:05:02.760> he<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:02.970> mentally<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:04.050> how<00:05:04.230> good

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
how strong he is mentally and how good

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.900 
how strong he is mentally and how good
his<00:05:04.500> game<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.460> think<00:05:05.520> he's<00:05:05.760> probably

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
his game is and I think he's probably

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.310 
his game is and I think he's probably
using<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.330> better<00:05:06.510> place<00:05:06.750> as<00:05:06.930> well

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320

all of it you know if there's no way if

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.920 
all of it you know if there's no way if

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
you tries to do that

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.140 
you tries to do that
you'll<00:05:55.140> fall<00:05:55.440> down<00:05:55.500> but<00:05:56.010> he<00:05:56.070> can<00:05:56.340> l<00:05:56.640> play<00:05:56.700> him

you'll fall down but he can l play him
tactically<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.140> match<00:05:58.770> play<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.220> that's<00:05:59.550> the

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
tactically and match play and that's the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.040 
tactically and match play and that's the
only<00:06:00.000> way<00:06:00.120> I<00:06:00.150> think<00:06:00.450> you<00:06:00.510> can<00:06:00.660> beat<00:06:00.840> him<00:06:00.960> he's

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
only way I think you can beat him he's

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.510 
only way I think you can beat him he's
got<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.200> stick<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.530> his<00:06:01.650> own<00:06:01.800> game<00:06:02.070> not<00:06:02.370> worry

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
got a stick to his own game not worry

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.550 
got a stick to his own game not worry
about<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.880> opponent<00:06:03.420> and<00:06:03.810> just<00:06:03.990> do<00:06:04.290> what<00:06:04.470> he's

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
about the opponent and just do what he's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.810 
about the opponent and just do what he's
been<00:06:04.590> doing<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:05.190> don't<00:06:05.340> think<00:06:05.520> he<00:06:05.700> can

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
been doing I don't think he can

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.520 
been doing I don't think he can
outscored<00:06:06.240> him<00:06:06.360> but<00:06:06.570> he's<00:06:06.660> got<00:06:06.810> a<00:06:06.840> score<00:06:07.110> yeah

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530

he's got his chances come he's got to

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.770 
he's got his chances come he's got to
make<00:06:11.130> more<00:06:11.340> than<00:06:11.430> 60<00:06:11.790> or<00:06:11.880> 70<00:06:12.210> every<00:06:12.510> time<00:06:12.660> he

is playing as well Steve at the moment

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.660 
is playing as well Steve at the moment
it<00:06:16.050> puts<00:06:16.260> that<00:06:16.440> extra<00:06:16.920> bit<00:06:17.010> of<00:06:17.070> pressure<00:06:17.340> that

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
it puts that extra bit of pressure that

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.950 
it puts that extra bit of pressure that
you<00:06:17.760> know<00:06:17.910> that<00:06:18.060> if<00:06:18.150> he<00:06:18.270> gets<00:06:18.480> in<00:06:18.660> you're<00:06:18.840> gonna

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
you know that if he gets in you're gonna

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.230 
you know that if he gets in you're gonna
probably<00:06:19.650> lose<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.950> frame<00:06:20.160> so<00:06:20.730> does<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.120> mean

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
probably lose the frame so does it mean

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.520 
probably lose the frame so does it mean
that<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.480> become<00:06:21.630> a<00:06:21.750> little<00:06:22.020> bit<00:06:22.110> more<00:06:22.260> tight

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
that you become a little bit more tight
