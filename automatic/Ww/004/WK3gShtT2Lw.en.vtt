flags cab like let's say we have a and B
and<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> should<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.539> spawning<00:00:48.840> at

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and you know they should be spawning at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.049 
and you know they should be spawning at
sea<00:00:49.230> they'll<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.590> spawning<00:00:49.890> around<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.670> close

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sea they'll be spawning around be close

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
sea they'll be spawning around be close
to<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.899> sea<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.370> they'll<00:00:53.579> be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to a at sea around see they'll be

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
to a at sea around see they'll be
spawning<00:00:53.940> everywhere<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.199> bonds

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
spawning everywhere I think this bonds

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.110 
spawning everywhere I think this bonds
are<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:56.070> messed<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.670> Cory<00:00:56.969> no

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
are a little bit messed up on Cory no

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.270 
are a little bit messed up on Cory no
I'm<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.690> huge<00:00:58.289> fan<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.590> them<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.039> i'm<00:00:59.160> not

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I'm not a huge fan of them but i'm not

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
I'm not a huge fan of them but i'm not
completely<00:00:59.640> against<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.960> think

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
completely against them so I do think

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
completely against them so I do think
they're<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.620> bit<00:01:01.800> weird<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
they're a little bit weird but as to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
they're a little bit weird but as to
what<00:01:03.840> gun<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.350> definitely<00:01:04.500> choose<00:01:04.890> as

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
what gun I would definitely choose as

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
what gun I would definitely choose as
you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.460> I'm<00:01:05.549> using<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> bal<00:01:06.000> 27<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you can see I'm using the bal 27 of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
you can see I'm using the bal 27 of
course<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> obsidians<00:01:07.950> d<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> best<00:01:08.520> italy

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
course the obsidians d the best italy

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
course the obsidians d the best italy
version<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.479> opinion<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> which<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.650> think

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
version my opinion of it which i think

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.990 
version my opinion of it which i think
is<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.189> cool<00:01:11.310> definitely<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:11.850> better

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
is really cool definitely a lot better

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.270 
is really cool definitely a lot better
than<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> inferno<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
than the inferno I I do think that the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800 
than the inferno I I do think that the
obsidian<00:01:14.670> seed<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> great<00:01:15.270> choice<00:01:15.450> maybe

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
obsidian seed is a great choice maybe

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
obsidian seed is a great choice maybe
even<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.830> short<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.310> range

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
even a little bit too short at range

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.679 
even a little bit too short at range
maybe<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> should<00:01:18.060> choose<00:01:18.240> something<00:01:18.299> like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
maybe you should choose something like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
maybe you should choose something like
the<00:01:18.840> ak-12<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> hbr<00:01:20.040> maybe<00:01:20.729> even

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the ak-12 or the hbr maybe even

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
the ak-12 or the hbr maybe even
something<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:21.930> sniper<00:01:22.259> rifle<00:01:22.650> or

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
something like a more sniper rifle or

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
something like a more sniper rifle or
links<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
links you know I really don't like the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.550 
links you know I really don't like the
links<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.930> recommending<00:01:25.439> other

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
links but I'm just recommending other

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.749 
links but I'm just recommending other
sniper<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.189> definitely<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
sniper up so I definitely think the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.280 
sniper up so I definitely think the
Moors<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> most<00:01:27.360> dominant<00:01:27.689> cyber<00:01:27.900> rifle

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Moors is the most dominant cyber rifle

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.510 
Moors is the most dominant cyber rifle
if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> guys<00:01:28.829> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> try<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.280> sniper

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
rifles on this map there's some

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
rifles on this map there's some
definitely<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:31.920> long<00:01:32.250> range

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
definitely some really really long range

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
definitely some really really long range
engagements<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.170> didn't<00:01:34.409> AR

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
engagements so I do think that didn't AR

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
engagements so I do think that didn't AR
would<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.100> decision<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.600> my

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
would be a good decision it really in my

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
would be a good decision it really in my
opinion<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.110> interaction<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.920> map<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
opinion the interaction of this map is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
opinion the interaction of this map is
really<00:01:39.090> cool<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> much<00:01:40.320> about<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
really cool I don't know much about it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.319 
really cool I don't know much about it
actually<00:01:40.979> I've<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.400> seen<00:01:41.610> gameplay<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> my

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
actually I've only seen gameplay on my

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
actually I've only seen gameplay on my
friend<00:01:43.110> cassock<00:01:43.500> scientist<00:01:43.920> channel<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.460> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
friend cassock scientist channel which I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
friend cassock scientist channel which I
didn't<00:01:45.119> really<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> interact<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
didn't really get to interact with it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.450 
didn't really get to interact with it
because<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> care<00:01:46.740> package<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.310> map

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
because I get a care package on this map

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
because I get a care package on this map
but<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:47.880> believe<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
but what I do believe is it kind of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
but what I do believe is it kind of
surrounds<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> like

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
surrounds you and then you go on to like

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
surrounds you and then you go on to like
you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:51.750> doing<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:52.079> now

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you know like what I'm doing right now

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840 
you know like what I'm doing right now
I'm<00:01:52.290> capturing<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'm capturing see and then it kind of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
I'm capturing see and then it kind of
protects<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.450> watches<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
protects you and watches it's kind of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.749 
protects you and watches it's kind of
like<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> soldier<00:01:56.040> own<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> personal

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
like it a soldier own like a personal

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.209 
like it a soldier own like a personal
overwatch<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.360> soldier<00:01:57.750> own<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
overwatch a soldier own that's really to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.469 
overwatch a soldier own that's really to
what<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> don't<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.299> much

what I know it as I don't know much

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
what I know it as I don't know much
about<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.009> kind<00:02:02.219> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
about it I think it's probably kind of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.800 
about it I think it's probably kind of
cool<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.670> trying<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> crazy<00:02:03.540> but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's probably kind of cool that's what I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's probably kind of cool that's what I
think<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.540> would

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
core is you have to run UAVs and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.930

systematics<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> know<00:02:11.459> I'm<00:02:11.819> being

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
systematics now I know I'm being

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.620

work<00:02:37.990> up<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.200> my<00:02:38.380> other<00:02:38.470> killstreaks<00:02:38.920> fairly

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
work up to my other killstreaks fairly

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.860 
work up to my other killstreaks fairly
easily<00:02:39.460> so<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.090> would<00:02:40.270> really<00:02:40.480> suggest<00:02:40.600> that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
easily so I would really suggest that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.230 
easily so I would really suggest that
then<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.170> got<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.320> run<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> UAV<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> speed

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
then you got to run the UAV with a speed

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.390 
then you got to run the UAV with a speed
I<00:02:43.540> want<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.950> lets<00:02:45.070> me<00:02:45.160> see

one that lets me see through walls

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.800 
one that lets me see through walls
that's<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.820> good<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.210> UAV<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> can

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
that's really good on the UAV if you can

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.240 
that's really good on the UAV if you can
get<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:04.990> whole<00:03:05.170> team<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.560> run<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.710> set<00:03:06.100> like

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
get your whole team to run a set like

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.160 
get your whole team to run a set like
that<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.790> consistently<00:03:07.600> cycle<00:03:07.990> through<00:03:08.140> all

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that and consistently cycle through all

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.570 
that and consistently cycle through all
of<00:03:08.290> them<00:03:08.500> while<00:03:08.710> playing<00:03:08.920> objective<00:03:09.460> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
of them while playing objective and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.520 
of them while playing objective and
doing<00:03:09.760> all<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.360> definitely<00:03:11.170> think<00:03:11.380> you're

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
doing all that I definitely think you're

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.990 
doing all that I definitely think you're
going<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.740> bound<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.070> get<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.220> DNA<00:03:12.430> bomb<00:03:12.790> on

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
going to be bound to get a DNA bomb on

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.940 
going to be bound to get a DNA bomb on
havoc<00:03:13.540> or<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> havoc<00:03:14.500> deal<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.830> make

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
havoc or on the havoc deal so you make

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.440 
havoc or on the havoc deal so you make
map<00:03:15.250> pack<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.580> general<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.090> definitely

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
map pack in general that definitely

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
map pack in general that definitely
applies<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:16.870> every<00:03:17.020> map<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:17.320> there

because<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.800> DNA<00:03:18.070> bomb<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.460> do<00:03:18.760> think

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
because the DNA bomb I do think

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.460 
because the DNA bomb I do think
especially<00:03:19.240> core<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:20.140> not<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.380> greatest

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
especially core it's not the greatest
