00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.760
 it's 50 80 hd sport that you're fine 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 after a new video on the channel 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.810
 the review of roanne cuadrado the skinner 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.329
 that we come who plays on the side of the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.189
 fiorentina a very good player you go 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.870
 see it through this review you have 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.980
 assigned herself aims so many challenges I 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.780
 So invite you to pause for 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.790
 a master in art can observe them at 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 team level this is exactly the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.660
 same team during the review or 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.640
 previous that of marco reus 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.500
 note that there are still some clips 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.430
 that are alike in being given 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.769
 there are passes from both brands to 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.660
 Russian cuadrado to or exceed 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.179
 two cuadrado for marco reus is rather 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.620
 in this sense, by the way, so the 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.239
 cuadrado what can we say about 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.239
 him I'm going to start by talking about his 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.329
 price its price is between 25000 and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.059
 35000 credit following the consoles this is 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.630
 a rather high price that's true for a 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.120
 single player 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.710
 but I found them very powerful 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.270
 so I found them very good at 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.229
 a single post and that's how I 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.520
 will start this review 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.890
 so when you could see jelly game 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.210
 in a 4 3 tomorrow had some of that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.650
 really the post where I found he 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.350
 was the best game test them in 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.659
 3.3 cases in ad and in 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.100
 devices where he is in middle right and 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.869
 I found it really mean and 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.299
 oddly there in this device 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.670
 this case 3 2 1 where the wingers are over 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.829
 refocused in the lax are more in the lax 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.939
 I found that he was really very 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.740
 very good so if I have to you the 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.360
 advise her in this device there 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.530
 where I found them really at the top 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.670
 so at the level of these negative points 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.189
 now because he still has some 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.750
 some his stats in strength he at 1.64 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.450
 in force he still move enough 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.619
 easily at the shoulder he has a small 77 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.820
 in balance that compensates for time in 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.100
 time but it's true that it stata in 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.109
 force makes him move really 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.520
 too easily and in some 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.740
 situations it can still pose some 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.149
 problems and finally so his head game 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.619
 even though good there you see I mark a 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.299
 goal of the head rather nice since there is 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.490
 a defender on him his head game 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.610
 still remains 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.130
 really bison he in 59 years precision of 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.739
 head and also in jump he 's 60 years old at 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.209
 so a really very very relaxing 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.140
 low which prevents us from taking 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.730
 still a lot of balloons from the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.340
 head there the goal of the head will not be 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.209
 if it was dropped the ball was dropped 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.010
 on his head because if you look 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.870
 well he does not even need to jump so 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.269
 we now go to the pros positive of the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.860
 king cuadrado already the 5 stars gestures 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.810
 techniques if this year it is also 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.099
 dear is precisely because of its 5 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.959
 stars technical gestures because this 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.010
 year beat little what he is with him to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.910
 note that I put the three stars 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.920
 bad foot in the positives 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.680
 also because his left foot is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.720
 rather good and suddenly I decided to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.100
 specify I put a lot of goals with 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.799
 his left foot and also move some 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.810
 decisive assists earlier rather nice 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.549
 so all that is going to be the aspect 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.280
 technique obviously of the quadra dos and of 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.019
 the slaughter the speed 93 guest on the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.730
 card it's going really very very fast I have 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.319
 put in the most finish at 75 in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.350
 finish for a winger it's rather 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.819
 it's nice enough it's true but its 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.400
 finishing me anyway problem 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.260
 in certain situations, including 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.660
 I do not know he missed me stuff 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.329
 there is face to face with the guardian he 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.190
 just to hit hit a bit much 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.480
 chosen for no purpose I do not know why 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.070
 he pulls over so that's 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.690
 still somewhat problematic so 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.040
 as I said a certain balance 77 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.320
 in equilibrium that offsets anyway 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.609
 from time to time that stats in strength rather 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.250
 do all that is the long aspect 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.730
 shock 83 strike power 80 in one 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.739
 shot 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.940
 it does they send rockets they 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.840
 send rockets even though I have 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.190
 not marked long hot 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.630
 it sends rockets there is a lot 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.010
 that have not gone very far 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.049
 douglas and already last clip yes I 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.940
 scored a free kick with him then the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.840
 free kicks 60 the time precision shot 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.380
 Frank I did not put in the points 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.030
 positive 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.530
 I would have more because for I mark 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.390
 a free kick with a player that a stadium 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.400
 rather average it's true we have the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 free kick was pretty good so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.150
 you already have the record of the king cuadrado 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.160
 which is displayed before your eyes so at 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.959
 level of agility positives 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.819
 speed the speed is really fast 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.950
 finish 75 in finish for a winger 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.180
 it still remains correct if there is a 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.790
 boosted version I think about to 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.470
 bus versions this year it cuadrado 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.540
 risk of up still not bad at 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.799
 level of his star in balance finish 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.340
 he is really very good about his 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.769
 legs from time to time anyway 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.330
 it offsets finding strength loupiotes 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.560
 aggressiveness to have spoken about it but at 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.730
 level of aggression the often 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.650
 train the ball carrier to squeeze 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.130
 the basis is that they play and he has 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.199
 start 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.250
 right back if I say no nonsense 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.109
 it seems to me that he played back right 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.250
 in the past and suddenly bah is 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.830
 maybe that's why he has leftovers 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.360
 aggressiveness in his stats 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.740
 three states the wrong foot his foot 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.150
 left which is rather good despite its 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.440
 three star positioning very very 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.940
 easy to find on the ground this is 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.229
 still a big positive point the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.370
 pass quality I did not talk about it but 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.750
 it really sends caviars that this 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.270
 either the centers the passes in 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.160
 depth passes lobed passes 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.020
 short frankly really a very 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.280
 very good smuggler the five- star gestures 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.419
 techniques obviously that's why 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.220
 we take two quadras back and for that 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.080
 that he is and his punching power he 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.710
 hits very very hard and so in the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.680
 negative points 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.300
 so forth I help you jump I help you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.610
 remains a little bit secondary for a 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.900
 wank anyway but it feels like 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.180
 children which poses any problem 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.340
 in certain situations and so you 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.950
 strike out with 17 games 17 goals 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.900
 and 10 assists ya not all 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.760
 goals and all the assists I 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.320
 apologize for that, but because there is actually 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.639
 some matches where I was not filming so 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.919
 I do not have to keep everything 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.960
 that was 29.91 hd I hope that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.039
 this review of roanne cuadrado has you 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.150
 it's too fast to call do not hesitate 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.919
 to put 1 blue thumbs dropped a 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.810
 comment to share this video 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.610
 friends and family to everyone we get 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.229
 will find again soon for a new 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.400
 review I really do not know what he's going 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.960
 to be in the team of the week who 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.060
 fate today at the moment the video 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.770
 will be released it will already be available but if 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.630
 a hassine look shape I think you 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.620
 do the review of the wolf cassine form I 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.880
 want to say next and I was taking 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.880
 care of yourself by everyone
