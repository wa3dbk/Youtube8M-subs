00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 four way road with a porn 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.540
 pt giving a scare in general speak shelter 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.389
 on android and pirate terror 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.670
 ball roll because it's starting one more 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.639
 checkpoint your daily news video 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.039
 here from the bajaki games with finished 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 recently and during the fair to Bethesda 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.650
 made a private demonstration of folotyn 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 4 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.760
 Do you know what this demo is like? 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 for the press can not be taken 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.619
 but it's going to have a guy been there said 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 and it goes that same guy uploaded this 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 video on porn site 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 this goes to the category of stories 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
 bizarre from the net 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.399
 after the video leaked on youtube to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 beauty ran to block the material 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.739
 but our intrepid friend really wanted 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 video and chose the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 the paulo 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 the quality is low mainly 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.329
 because the video was filmed hidden but 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.649
 it's still in the air as I know it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 a friend of mine who accesses this type of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 site told me the pt that is the playbook 0 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.949
 leave hills 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.469
 already neymar is in the air on psn the konami already 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 canceled the game is pushing the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.890
 crumbs down the carpet 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.049
 but then the people go there and discover a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.600
 thing in the game or better in the teaser that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.299
 nobody had seen the user yet. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 hatch meta tronic partners posted that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 according to some specific steps 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 mainly leaving the initial room 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.610
 walking on your back you can see the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.890
 ghost of the smooth blink 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 is a small light detail but already are 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.060
 months and months of millions of people 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.369
 playing and only now the moment come up 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 It's one more nudge in the heart of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.759
 everyone who would like to see the project 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 become reality 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
 Who is playing or thinking about playing? 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 of 23 the headquarters network project has launched a new 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 update that fix the problems of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
 video that appeared because of a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.549
 previous update 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 in real that rolled is that the previous pet 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.259
 has caused various parts of the game 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.960
 stay heavier dropping frames 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.180
 Back home in the 20s in a few moments. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.820
 the new update seems fine 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.250
 this but unfortunately on playstation 4 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.590
 some scenarios continue to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.659
 flour and that of course was bullshit 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 for the gang of xbox thousandth degree since in the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 the year things were resolved 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.140
 the problem becomes more evident in the swamp 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.349
 where the year comes close to the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.830
 30 fps and OPWAY 4 comes to fall below 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.230
 20 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420
 The tests were performed by the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.140
 digital fan than concluded that no 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.120
 moment with the pet 11.08 the version of 23 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.860
 for the microsoft console is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 presenting the best performance 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 remains to know if new updates come 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.260
 to correct those variations and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.930
 making the game the state that it is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.330
 I found the 1.05 where everything from 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.970
 goal is already clear to everyone 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.760
 that microsoft is approaching the xbox 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.340
 one of windows 10 even more after the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.140
 company conference on games with 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.270
 people already know that some games like that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.610
 he insists on fable led then 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.390
 will also go out to the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.160
 computer 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.670
 but what about games like the ones that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 bucket while a break and crack of 13 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.080
 according to phil spencer these three titles 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
 and a few others began their 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.950
 development before microsoft 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.350
 decide on this approximation of the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.450
 platforms and would be quite complex 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.340
 ask the developers to enter the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.560
 support for windows 10 in the project 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.270
 at this point in the spencer 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.130
 that they never went out in the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.320
 computers but if that comes 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.690
 what happens is nothing confirmed 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.880
 will take longer than other titles because 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.680
 the company does not intend to interfere with 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.640
 producers with this request. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.709
 at the time 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.840
 Phil Spencer also made it clear that neither 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.910
 everything was going out in both environments 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.100
 each case is a case and the executive 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.130
 do you believe that some games can 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.110
 to be exclusively on the pc 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.920
 exclusively on xbox or in the two 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.290
 platforms 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 decisions are taken individually 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.130
 to each project 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.600
 during the betesda conference at e3 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.730
 they announced a new fallout game 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.560
 shelter but that would be temporarily 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.850
 exclusive for iphone 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.860
 the android personal with any group 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.840
 show but you can rejoice personally whom 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.480
 is being released today for android 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.880
 download is 141 mega and is already 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 available in the story Shelter was told 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.080
 a multiple standoff phenomenon 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.570
 record download and time played and 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.070
 now android owners can enjoy and 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.750
 This was the rapid insertion of 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.120
 news that we are coming back looks 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 only then came back the following one 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.209
 that Microsoft is 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.810
 investing in windows 10 as platform 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.370
 gamer 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.380
 they are not playing and not today 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.060
 bombarded the entire internet news 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.100
 about the company's policy regarding the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.930
 piracy of the new system is an issue 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.180
 very complex 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.310
 then we will explain among the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.810
 terms of service of the new windows 10 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.970
 there is a clause stating that the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.680
 microsoft could block content 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.330
 pirated and unauthorized 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 computer as it is undeniable that the 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.259
 piracy throughout the world and also the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.910
 respect for users' privacy 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.740
 after all, no one that microsoft 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.320
 snooping on the machine itself 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.300
 the staff was shocked but the truth is 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.400
 that this is a clause where the company 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.199
 intends to prepare the legal ground 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.320
 protect some practices 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.599
 piracy and more the clause does not 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.180
 specifically applies windows 10 as 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.070
 a whole but rather to the services of the system 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.000
 who work with 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.979
 microsoft 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.810
 let 's take a practical example of downloading 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.340
 pirate games will not be totally 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.870
 monitored on your system 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.150
 But if some smart guy 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.460
 use of unofficial codes to 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.360
 add features in xbox live games 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.580
 no pc 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.710
 it can be banned the same applies 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.500
 for anyone trying to change other services 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.539
 like office 365 or andrae vi 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.789
 summarizing trying to apply blows of 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.259
 software on your machine in programs that 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.449
 They communicate with servers 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.770
 microsoft can result in large 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.810
 problems in the future 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.580
 We stay here very personal. 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.520
 Thank you for the company of all of you. 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.330
 a kiss a hug and a gif from my friend 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.250
 max 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.210
 See you at the check point edition. 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.210
 of tomorrow she
