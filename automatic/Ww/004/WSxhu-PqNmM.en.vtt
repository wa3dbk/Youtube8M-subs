00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 so don't wanna tell you a little about 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.379
 new tool 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:12.210
 features of its application and methods 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.490
 working with him I will begin to start about the very 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 tool 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 the main idea means this tool 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.220
 is the opportunity to work any 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.720
 parts of the ending that is not only 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 standard termination as in the case of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 an ordinary tool yes but the whole 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 its surface that is for this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 the tool has a special point 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 he has all the chrome to work ethic 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.940
 instrument that is the whole part this part 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.219
 and graduation has everything working 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 the surface is therefore basically possible 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.329
 apply any part that is like 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.449
 normal scrap you can work let's say 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.059
 this bend you can work like this 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 same this ending and accordingly 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.809
 you can go into everything 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.120
 hard to reach places with help here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.460
 this one 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.080
 bend yes that is by and large it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 such a shaved hook that can 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.000
 climb up 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 in all difficult places and you can force 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.820
 provide both strength work and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.610
 pinpoint work before vodka 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.460
 ending all the endings they have here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 such a narrow narrow shape and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 special sharpening which allows 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 Firstly apply this tool in non 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 peculiar to him places that is under 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.210
 some kind of amplifiers in there 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 difficult access everywhere you can 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.750
 then it means to apply it well and accordingly 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.049
 when the vodka finish tool 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.759
 which will allow you to hit the point 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.790
 some difficult difficult places especially 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.979
 when it comes to working tool on 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.049
 distance at some when you're through 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.180
 some let's say hole went in 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.370
 cavities you need to get into some kind of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 small sink 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.990
 Island Dent relatively speaking which 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.190
 you need you deploy here for this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.050
 this tool will be perfect not 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.590
 look at what the ending is 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.200
 sharp 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.330
 many may think that they will 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.060
 work too hard to prick 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.950
 this will not happen if you will 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.950
 just see where the ending is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 tool and use it like that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.350
 footwear 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.910
 one important feature of this 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.100
 tool is an opportunity 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.500
 work through noise insulation 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.870
 materials and sealants 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.430
 such here where hard vibro 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.530
 insulating materials on especially 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.680
 European cars this tool 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.310
 handle without dismantling noise 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.310
 insulation material
