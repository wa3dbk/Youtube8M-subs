well<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:14.130> through<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> couple<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> those

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well going through a couple of those

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.219 
well going through a couple of those
measures<00:01:15.210> firstly<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> derivative<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
measures firstly the derivative of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.810 
measures firstly the derivative of
kilojoules<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.920> vending<00:01:17.280> machines<00:01:17.610> that's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
kilojoules on vending machines that's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.580 
kilojoules on vending machines that's
surely<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> good<00:01:18.479> thing<00:01:18.689> isn't<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.990> any<00:01:19.350> any

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
surely a good thing isn't it any any

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
surely a good thing isn't it any any
company<00:01:19.979> should<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.220> commended<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
company should be commended for that it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
company should be commended for that it
is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.689> good<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.680> enough<00:01:22.830> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
is a good thing but it's not enough we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.359 
is a good thing but it's not enough we
know<00:01:23.330> information<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.170> weak<00:01:25.470> way

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
know information is a very very weak way

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.310 
know information is a very very weak way
of<00:01:26.670> making<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> difference<00:01:27.900> there's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of making a difference there's a lot of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.810 
of making a difference there's a lot of
information<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.520> really

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
information out there it's not really

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
information out there it's not really
working<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> went<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
working very well but if I went to a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
working very well but if I went to a
vending<00:01:31.710> machine<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.159> saw<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.610> the

vending machine and I saw you know the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
vending machine and I saw you know the
can<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> coke<00:01:33.240> hairs<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.170> many<00:01:34.229> cups

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
can of coke hairs you know so many cups

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.410 
can of coke hairs you know so many cups
of<00:01:34.680> sugar<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.430> many<00:01:35.579> kilojoules<00:01:35.820> versus

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of sugar or so many kilojoules versus

yeah<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> look<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> step

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
yeah I look I think it's it is a step

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
yeah I look I think it's it is a step
forward<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:45.990> already<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.590> information

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
forward there's already that information

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.649 
forward there's already that information
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> new

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
on the can so that's not a new

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
on the can so that's not a new
initiative<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.470> put<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> cans<00:01:50.189> which

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
initiative to put it on the cans which

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
initiative to put it on the cans which
is<00:01:50.520> another<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.939> they've<00:01:51.149> announced<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is another thing they've announced and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.260 
is another thing they've announced and
we<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.100> enough<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:54.060> make<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
we don't think that's enough to make a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030 
we don't think that's enough to make a
difference<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.990> while<00:01:55.500> they're<00:01:55.740> heavily

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
difference and while they're heavily

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490
