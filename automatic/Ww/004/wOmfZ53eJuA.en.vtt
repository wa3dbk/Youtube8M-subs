00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.770
 introduction and 360 degree view 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.080
 the olympus xz 2 counts with her very much 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.869
 bright lens and once too 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.360
 17 inch big picture sensor among the best 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.340
 premium compact cameras accordingly 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.160
 but of course more expensive than others 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 compact models olympus is therefore one 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.070
 Clever way and bring the olympus 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 xz 10 1 slimmed down in a few points 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
 model in the market 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.640
 this one has a 1/2 3 inches tall 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.370
 and c mos sensor a little smaller 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.969
 Image sensor sensor sensitivity can 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.930
 also only between iso 100 and iso 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.300
 6,400 are set 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.879
 when it resolves, it changes 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.699
 nothing will continue 11 8 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.109
 megapixel recorded the 5x 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.390
 zoom lens covers one 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.080
 Small picture equivalent focal length of 26 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.870
 up to 130 mm and thus offers in 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.910
 compared to the olympus xz 2 at the easy 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.410
 enlarged focal length range only 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.010
 There are minor changes in the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.840
 luminous intensity 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 this lies with f18 weitwinkel and f 27 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.030
 reigning on almost identical 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.369
 level of image control until the olympus 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 xz scenes a 30 inch big monitor 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.790
 the 920,000 pixel resolves this one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.560
 as with the xc 2 via a touch 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.560
 surface the among other things to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.290
 can be used to trigger videos 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.450
 save the olympus xz scenes in full 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.409
 hd resolution with 30 full frames per 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.119
 second and h 264 encoding the sound becomes 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.460
 recorded by a stereo microphone 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.219
 as a photo program is next to the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.079
 fully automatic and the psn modes too 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.740
 freely configurable user mode 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.920

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.840

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.750
 Olympus XZ Scenes presents pictures and videos 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.000
 on SD sdhc or sdxc memory cards 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 place next to this introductory video 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 we give you the camera in other videos 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.970
 in detail before they learn eg 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.590
 closer to the equipment 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.590
