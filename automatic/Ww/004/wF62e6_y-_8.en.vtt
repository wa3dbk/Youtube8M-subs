idea got the existing my dad flipped

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.490 
idea got the existing my dad flipped
around<00:01:33.500> angled<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:36.500> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
around angled up just a little bit that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.190 
around angled up just a little bit that
idea<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> back<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.350> we've<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.860> our<00:01:41.070> new

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
idea on the back and we've got our new

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
idea on the back and we've got our new
right<00:01:43.200> tail<00:01:43.560> light<00:01:44.450> setup<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:46.310> pushed<00:01:47.310> up

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
right tail light setup just pushed up

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.750 
right tail light setup just pushed up
here

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
here

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.220 
here
let's<00:01:50.760> cut<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> cut<00:01:52.410> out<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.740> sides

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
let's cut off all this cut out the sides

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.900 
let's cut off all this cut out the sides
painter<00:01:55.230> up<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.620> it's<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.130> plastic<00:01:56.400> I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
painter up so it's not just plastic I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.730 
painter up so it's not just plastic I
think<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> should<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.660> pretty<00:01:57.720> schmick

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.990 

another<00:02:01.740> good<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> mark<00:02:02.550> out<00:02:02.760> your

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
another good way to mark out your

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.480 
another good way to mark out your
spacings<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.260> be<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.590> use<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.830> divider

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
spacings on here to be to use a divider

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.810 
spacings on here to be to use a divider
I<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.690> divider<00:02:07.160> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
I don't have a divider but I have a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.430 
I don't have a divider but I have a
caliper<00:02:09.150> which<00:02:09.630> has<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.340> nice<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:12.200> sharp<00:02:13.200> edge

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
caliper which has a nice some sharp edge

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.550 
caliper which has a nice some sharp edge
on<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:13.980> put<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.340> wines<00:02:14.550> down<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.150> to

is to make the new table break light a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.110 
is to make the new table break light a
little<00:03:35.790> unit<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.690> I've<00:03:36.810> got<00:03:37.050> some<00:03:37.500> aluminium

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
little unit so I've got some aluminium

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.250 
little unit so I've got some aluminium
that's<00:03:39.120> right<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.480> Americans<00:03:39.990> it's<00:03:40.140> an

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
that's right you Americans it's an

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.460 
that's right you Americans it's an
aluminium<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:41.280> bloody<00:03:41.580> aluminum<00:03:42.470> brackets

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
aluminium not bloody aluminum brackets

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.120 
aluminium not bloody aluminum brackets
that<00:03:44.100> I'm<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:44.610> put<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.530> working<00:03:46.530> wires<00:03:46.830> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130

so then I can just put some normal bulbs

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.060 
so then I can just put some normal bulbs
in<00:03:51.450> there<00:03:51.660> wire<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.860> existing

and going around the edge

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.170 
and going around the edge
I've<00:05:23.250> just<00:05:23.400> got<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.640> shrink<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.940> down<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.090> bit

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
I've just got to shrink it down a bit

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.910 
I've just got to shrink it down a bit
more<00:05:24.480> so<00:05:24.660> it'll<00:05:24.840> fit<00:05:25.020> on<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.350> inside

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
more so it'll fit on the inside

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.460 
more so it'll fit on the inside
so<00:05:26.820> not<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.210> exciting<00:05:27.750> process<00:05:27.990> they're
