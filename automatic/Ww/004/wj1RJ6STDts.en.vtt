you just select the half button and the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.950 
you just select the half button and the
esses<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.650> need<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:13.070> be<00:03:13.570> Center<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.540> try

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
esses you need to be Center or you try

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
esses you need to be Center or you try
another<00:03:18.110> SS<00:03:18.650> again<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.220> now<00:03:25.520> we<00:03:25.580> all<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:26.980> center

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
another SS again so now we all do center

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.590 
another SS again so now we all do center
or<00:03:28.220> half<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:30.670> dimension<00:03:31.840> press<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> half<00:03:33.230> key

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
or half the dimension press a half key

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.150 
or half the dimension press a half key
you'll<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:36.650> pop<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.310> truth<00:03:37.700> Isis<00:03:38.240> so

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
you'll just pop me the truth Isis so

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.780 
you'll just pop me the truth Isis so
accesses<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.970> we<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.360> half<00:03:42.550> that's<00:03:43.550> four

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790
