nearly all the weather conditions I was

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.889 
nearly all the weather conditions I was
always<00:00:58.609> fascinated<00:00:58.909> by<00:00:59.510> high<00:00:59.690> tech

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
always fascinated by high tech

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.869 
always fascinated by high tech
technologies<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.069> that's<00:01:01.219> how<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:01.429> came<00:01:01.699> to

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
technologies and that's how I came to

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.210 
technologies and that's how I came to
her<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.030> not<00:01:02.300> again<00:01:02.600> history<00:01:02.989> go<00:01:03.800> there<00:01:04.040> you

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
her and not again history go there you

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
have to be at the edge of technology you

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.190 
have to be at the edge of technology you
have<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.370> use<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.880> latest<00:01:08.240> technologies<00:01:08.930> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
have to use the latest technologies to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.160
