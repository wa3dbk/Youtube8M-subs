although<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:18.930> think<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> should<00:00:19.439> be

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470

before<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> begin<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.939> lesson<00:00:21.150> let<00:00:21.570> me<00:00:21.630> first

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
before I begin this lesson let me first

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080 
before I begin this lesson let me first
define<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.250> exactly<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
define for you just what exactly the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.849 
define for you just what exactly the
lowest<00:00:24.390> common<00:00:24.570> multiple<00:00:24.689> really<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> by<00:00:25.680> way

lowest common multiple really is by way

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.339 
lowest common multiple really is by way
of<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.130> example<00:00:26.449> let's<00:00:27.449> begin<00:00:27.660> by<00:00:27.960> finding<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
of an example let's begin by finding the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
of an example let's begin by finding the
lowest<00:00:28.710> kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> multiple<00:00:29.310> between<00:00:29.670> four<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
lowest kind of multiple between four and

in<00:00:34.890> school<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.430> teacher<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.790> tell<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in school your teacher will tell you to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.850 
in school your teacher will tell you to
write<00:00:36.450> down<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> multiples<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.590> 4

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
write down all the multiples of 4

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.830 
write down all the multiples of 4
starting<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:38.700> multiple<00:00:39.480> which

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
starting from the first multiple which

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
starting from the first multiple which
is<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.230> itself<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> write<00:00:42.210> all

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
is for itself then have you write all

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
is for itself then have you write all
the<00:00:42.570> multiples<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> 6<00:00:43.379> starting<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the multiples of 6 starting with the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
the multiples of 6 starting with the
first<00:00:44.340> multiple<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> usually<00:00:45.780> six

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
first multiple which is usually six

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
first multiple which is usually six
itself<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.430> imagine<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.910> process

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
itself as you can imagine this process

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
itself as you can imagine this process
can<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.750> rather<00:00:48.899> boring<00:00:49.289> after<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> while<00:00:49.670> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
can get rather boring after a while then

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
common that is they are the same between

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720 
common that is they are the same between
the<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.840> groups<00:00:58.100> these<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.309> usually<00:00:59.399> are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the two groups these are usually are

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.720 
the two groups these are usually are
known<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.690> common<00:01:00.989> multiples<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
known as the common multiples and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
known as the common multiples and
finally<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.239> determined<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
finally they have you determined out of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.929 
finally they have you determined out of
all<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> common<00:01:05.129> multiples<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.820> are

all the common multiples that are

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
all the common multiples that are
circled<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.560> lowest

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
circled which of these is the lowest

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
circled which of these is the lowest
value<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.939> case<00:01:09.210> lowest<00:01:09.689> common

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
value in this case lowest common

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
value in this case lowest common
multiple<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.619> 12<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.299> lowest

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
multiple is 12 and that's how the lowest

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
multiple is 12 and that's how the lowest

is<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.300> write<00:03:30.600> out<00:03:30.750> all<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.080> numbers

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
is to write out all the numbers

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.770 
is to write out all the numbers
horizontally<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> single<00:03:32.610> row<00:03:32.820> on<00:03:33.060> top<00:03:33.600> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
horizontally on a single row on top of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.350 
horizontally on a single row on top of
an<00:03:33.900> inverted<00:03:34.320> division<00:03:34.770> symbol<00:03:35.240> start<00:03:36.240> with

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
an inverted division symbol start with

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.630 
an inverted division symbol start with
the<00:03:36.450> lowest<00:03:36.600> possible<00:03:37.010> Prime<00:03:38.010> as<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> divisor

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the lowest possible Prime as a divisor

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.010 
the lowest possible Prime as a divisor
in<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:40.200> case<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.280> prime<00:03:41.490> number<00:03:41.760> two<00:03:42.020> then

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
in this case the prime number two then

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.810 
in this case the prime number two then
ask<00:03:43.230> yourself<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.710> question<00:03:43.740> does<00:03:44.460> to<00:03:44.670> go
