00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
I wanted to show you a knife that I've

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.890 
I wanted to show you a knife that I've
been<00:01:02.160> working<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.360> I

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
been working with a little bit and I

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.210 
been working with a little bit and I
haven't<00:01:04.140> worked<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> long<00:01:04.890> time

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
haven't worked with it for a long time
yet<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.940> not<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> real<00:01:06.360> honest<00:01:06.750> review

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

of<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.190> video<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.880> took<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.840> saw<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of this video I took that saw and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.290 
of this video I took that saw and
created<00:01:50.340> an<00:01:50.460> Allpoint

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
created an Allpoint

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.760 
created an Allpoint
on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> front<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.990> saw<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> reason

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
on the front of that saw and the reason

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230 
on the front of that saw and the reason
I<00:01:52.830> did<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.910> one<00:01:54.150> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I did that was because that was one of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.010 
I did that was because that was one of
the<00:01:54.299> main<00:01:54.479> things<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> use<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:56.040> my

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the main things that I use on my

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.740 
the main things that I use on my
multi-tool<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.650> sak<00:01:59.220> was<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.000> saw<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
multi-tool or on my sak was that saw and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.469 
multi-tool or on my sak was that saw and
I<00:02:00.810> figured<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> gut<00:02:01.500> hook<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> can

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I figured this gut hook you know I can

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
I figured this gut hook you know I can
use<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> greatest<00:02:04.650> thing<00:02:04.830> in

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
use it it's not the greatest thing in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
use it it's not the greatest thing in
the<00:02:04.979> world<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> big<00:02:05.700> believer<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.119> gut

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the world I'm not a big believer in gut

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.569 
the world I'm not a big believer in gut
hook<00:02:06.540> type<00:02:06.810> knives<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.399> for

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
hook type knives but it's good for

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.069 
hook type knives but it's good for
cutting<00:02:08.759> cords<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.269> things<00:02:09.329> like<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.869> which

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
cutting cords and things like that which

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.319 
cutting cords and things like that which
saves<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.190> main<00:02:11.459> blade<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> keep

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
saves on the main blade so I can keep

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.060 
saves on the main blade so I can keep
that<00:02:12.510> thing<00:02:12.780> pretty<00:02:13.260> sharp<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.799> whittling

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
that thing pretty sharp for whittling

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
that thing pretty sharp for whittling
tasks<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.549> things<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.269> talked

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
