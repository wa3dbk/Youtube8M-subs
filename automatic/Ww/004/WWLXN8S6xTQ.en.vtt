00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
think about that they look cooler that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.070 
think about that they look cooler that
way<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.860> place<00:02:38.070> them<00:02:38.220> there<00:02:39.080> how

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
way if you just place them there how

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720 
way if you just place them there how
does<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.350> kind<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.680> look<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.860> you're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
does it kind of look like you're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.780 
does it kind of look like you're
shooting<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> like<00:02:42.620> some<00:02:43.620> cages<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.550> there's

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
shooting to like some cages and there's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.640 
shooting to like some cages and there's
something<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:45.990> looks<00:02:46.020> cool

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
