00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.279
 thanks to it was achieved not the team was 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.900
 pretty well you win when you set aside well 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:15.140
 to football and well let's hope that this 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.689
 give a push to the goal must be 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.820
 missing a very important game that 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.380
 you also have to win it yes or yes and that goes 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.560
 to be complicated so it's good what 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.019
 important was today was to win and is achieved 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.909
 now the uncle there you have to rest 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.679
 well recover us well we left 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.110
 alone that we are we do not have time 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.050
 with a little touched and recover what 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.940
 best possible to get to the hundred 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.309
 percent of next Sunday I was in 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.110
 doubt to play fortunately we did 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.120
 some tests and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.100
 and support well and already in the second time 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.870
 for a little more as a precaution he turned 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.120
 to tighten a bit but not like eight ago 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.790
 days and as a precaution we decided 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.090
 leave team that is being a tournament 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.340
 no and a good result was achieved I think 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.890
 that I insist that the work that exists 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.480
 team was very important the difference 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.820
 of goals to be able to aspire liguilla 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.650
 it is also important not if within 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.870
 the numbers I still think we 're with 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.790
 possibilities not to be able to aspire fight 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.680
 but it also depends on us going to 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.800
 face an important opponent on Sunday 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 we must put what we are doing 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.450
 with an angel and I think it was a good 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.100
 state for us was complicated 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.710
 against the rival we were not 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.470
 fighting with our difficulties in the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.540
 tournament we managed to be forceful that was 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.729
 what I have agreed, I did not have this 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.250
 put we are going to a result like this is you 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.840
 we respect the rival much more than 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.460
 came with the owner's body or which 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.690
 substitute for us was it was the same 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.670
 that playing like that would win 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.159
 we need for your third era just 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.609
 look for the triumph gave us believe 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.619
 sometimes to score so many goals the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.700
 team tries to play to win already 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.710
 then the goals 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.819
 they are giving work already of the work that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.619
 he did on the court we go very 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.689
 happy for the triumph for the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.709
 way I know it was achieved but 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.840
 we know how good we have to go 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.329
 puebla get a result of three 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.539
 points and then good to cross the fingers 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.039
 and pray forever they always look for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.420
 by getting your two positives from 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.239
 any way so it goes up very well 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.579
 you give it to him with union has always been 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.790
 important today I think it was a night 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.010
 round fortunately for us 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.590
 but we are also aware that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.769
 yes let's enjoy it with moderation because 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.720
 we have a very important week all 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.680
 will be seen against a team not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.370
 we can deny it 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.290
 They knew how to take advantage of their opportunities 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.239
 not although what obviously we 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.590
 we stop doing things but there are also 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.810
 that you have to give merit its merit to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.090
 team that brings good at the end is a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
 the most important thing was to concentrate the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 concentrates does more for that party that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.889
 for the final right now we have 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.200
 lost and there's order behind and now for 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.840
 the only party is good we are a group 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 we do not want everyone and we want together 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.560
 then a get up and we're going to have 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.340
 that raise our form because the most 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.340
 hard to be here
