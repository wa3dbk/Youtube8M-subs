00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.429
 Hello, I am at qvc beauty 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.360
 Nancy and I wanted nails today 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.730
 Talk about how to make beautiful nails 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 has without having something something on it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 So do without nail polish or something 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 or other but the nails in the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
 natural state but that they leave 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 still look very good, I know 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 quite a lot of problems with her 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.990
 have nails that they are brittle or 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.210
 yes very thin and not so very 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.440
 as you would like 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.329
 I have always done so 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.430
 that I like to wear common 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.309
 and that's why they become natural 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.890
 thicker robust and it looks better 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 but like mens natural state of the nail 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 in reality , under the gel is that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.410
 is usually not so nice and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.239
 I always notice that when I am 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.579
 the gel must renew and make that off 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.020
 and then that's what's under it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.850
 I always do that so that I mean 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.910
 from time to time nails from the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 opponents and then no name 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 do not want to apply this paint too 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 the extra again some vitamins 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 there so that the brand have just again 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.840
 well protected but always if you have the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
 you have to apply nail polish too 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 again take away with you and remover 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.810
 that harms the nails again 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 that's why it's just so out of circulation 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.900
 somehow you can not get out anymore 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.560
 and that's why I was looking for something 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.630
 the nails but protects one without 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 it is something that is on it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.549
 but just the nail itself 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.650
 just makes more robust and makes 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
 looks beautiful I have this set 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.630
 Here's a try that's from lcn 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.299
 that nokia that is a nurturing pullover 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.610
 and sealing system for natural nails 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.720
 and yes I try it a try 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.310
 it can not hurt 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.009
 but then I can too 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.750
 I was very much there 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.340
 skeptical because this actually exists 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560
 set 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.219
 just from this nail cream in these 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.229
 spot here on a nail oil and one 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.500
 but this is more of a nail file 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.780
 polished with three different zones 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.880
 and finally a brush yes that is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.469
 almost everything in this set was in it 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.110
 That's why I hopefully thought 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.789
 does that work as well as me? 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.099
 but then I have to try it out 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.480
 I was very surprised to say so 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.440
 explain it briefly as the whole 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 works 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.830
 you can also have a look now 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.390
 how to nail because under that always go 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.200
 so it looks like it really is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.450
 very broken very cracked and very 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.579
 unsightly but you see it yourself and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.380
 you start with that one 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.299
 Cream here too for this little one 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.660
 brush takes and then just on this 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.920
 nature situation completely applies and there must 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.299
 it is not necessarily great either 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.519
 be economical but that's what it takes 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.040
 not a super thick layer to be that 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.500
 it is such a yellowish cream 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 are proteins carrots oil and the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.910
 panthenol in it, therefore, also judges so 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.530
 easily medical in any case that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.750
 first with this included 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.069
 brushed completely on the nail and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.030
 then it goes on with it 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.130
 this file here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 this is not a normal nail file 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.069
 with which one somehow the nail 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.019
 if you could harm it then 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.940
 it goes on but that is really one 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.609
 fine polished file and I'll start 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.760
 take a look at this page with this pink and 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.950
 napoli me quasi this cream in 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.420
 the nail in so that's fine 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.549
 take a little bit of time for that, too 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.680
 I would use this cream as pure 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.450
 is massaged and I go too 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.060
 really pure in every corner and also 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.459
 in front and then that is actually too 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.769
 already done and part of the crisis is 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.180
 then almost in the nail but the other 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.370
 I'll just take it with me 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.780
 I have to wait for its normal 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.760
 say I can see it all 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.739
 already really great but it's all 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.180
 even further with the nail, then 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.370
 I'll wear it after that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.190
 Whole nail up and then polish 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.359
 attention with the white side next if 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.489
 I think that is now 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.530
 actually incorporated as well in 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.650
 the nail then it comes to an end 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.720
 continue with this gray side, so to speak, yes 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.319
 for finishing touches once again make 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.909
 me then 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.219
 times with the side completely the arge 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.560
 once polished and then that looks 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.489
 really top so you can do it all 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.200
 especially well seen on 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.909
 before-after-comparison resp 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.799
 when i use the finished nail with the 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.959
 other nails again compare the yes 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.000
 still look very broken and yes 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.400
 you might think that's right now 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.689
 looks like because it is just on oil 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.669
 but that's not true so it is 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.449
 really so that you can polish with this 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.150
 Cut the whole cream and nail 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.400
 really nice and pure massaged and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.229
 it stays that way, so it stays that way 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.340
 the next few days so she then 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.169
 really great 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.930
 You should only use this cream here once 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.820
 in the month but use that nagl oil so 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.650
 this step with nail and the gray 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.750
 You can do that one or two times a day 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.930
 do the week and if you like it 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.210
 then applies the situation really 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.860
 very pretty and very complementary 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.009
 Well, that really looks like 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.419
 If you had the super healthy cared for what 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.220
 of course you do not do it anymore 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.500
 Can apply a nail polish or 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.810
 they do that because the name is then 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.310
 that was polished very nicely 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.500
 also feels really fluid when 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.120
 then you go over it and then stop there 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.190
 of course , nothing else on it but 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.990
 when you look at this natural look 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.909
 then this set really is 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.650
 perfect so if you are really one 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.479
 have a bit of problems with your nails 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.280
 but they should look nice but 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.720
 no great nail polish on it now 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 I would like to make you then 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.440
 Suggest this set from me 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.389
 I think you will be pretty happy too 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240
 By the way, you can do that too 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.310
 For that you use the nails 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.590
 if you do that transition 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.360
 the sander house has grown as well 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.009
 Edited is sealed to the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.389
 transition and then prevented that is 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.220
 water for example under the gel 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.349
 So that's what's possible 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.639
 suitable this set so tried 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.009
 then write to me on cuba 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.599
 beauty de your experiences because 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.330
 As I said that surprised me very much 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.009
 and I'm interested in that for whatever reason 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.659
 again that then arrives with you or 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.880
 as what experience with it 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.570
 and then we'll see each other 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.570
