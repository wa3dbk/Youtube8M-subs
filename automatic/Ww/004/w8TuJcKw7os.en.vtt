00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.089
 is that being folded is the landmarks like any other 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.089
 It is with the most aggravating that the other nations do not have 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.319
 that is 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.799
 you have to go 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.549
 As I said earlier, you have to interpret 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.980
 what is someone interpreting 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.150
 you can hardly give your interpretation to him 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.089
 you give your interpretation knowledge 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.599
 puts your 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.269
 and earn your money 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.599
 if you have to bucho be double of week 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.460
 What you love very much 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.150
 yet to this day 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.140
 there is no what I can tell you why I said I said 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.110
 you credo would like you fundamentally vcs which is a main role 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.910
 is pop is the main snag but the Chilean if you watched the Christians the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.610
 I was a journeyman 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.590
 We are tired of hearing and knowing you. 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.810
 by the Russian proposal 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.590
 and since it happened I happened to take a cab already drink the driver of the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 better spend time flies 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.060
 to stop there, just let me tell you something about the football marijuana season 5 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.120
 I know the Lord 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.930
 to start 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.120
 I do not work thinking what? 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.010
 he said 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 I do not know why television was made then all 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.070
 he explains the preparer antônio mello 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 stayed a bit on the miranda landmarks that the archer 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.410
 almost unanimous opinion that he was 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.630
 one of the best things that is not the best thing that Iran wants to have. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 captain kirk 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 in my opinion it was 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.070
 with the marks miranda an actor 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.210
 became dubbers that his sport 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.270
 more for you know how to love retired Marcos Miranda 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.550
 he made seven more beds 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.680
 with pt 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 he did 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.480
 without neymar 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.360
 in Sao Paulo 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 the march mirandão 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.220
 a tower 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.500
 looking for something that maybe not even private show 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.979
 the martyr 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.509
 dead now little time 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.289
 even arrived a time he abandoned everything the model will have sought 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.069
 on site 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.009
 The New Cinema 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.999
 and it was strong 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.679
 So you come from thrashing this government. 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.679
 he always finds out in a box 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.149
 and indicated 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.149
 ten days of travel begins to take off in the tent and such 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 locked the landmark as Diego is difficult to see 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.690
 and in the income contribution on the scandal being crucified world 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.359
 a city and a people 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.359
 north and northeast 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.889
 offer a sigh 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 the Moroccan government 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.349
 commented with you because you lived together for 35 years. 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.459
 stuck 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.849
 he was driving 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.250
 commented as if something he liked to do captain kirk 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 that he's not a psychologist said of the scoreboard 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.669
 that actor more by the fact that they really like the actor 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.610
 No, sure 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.439
 with Miranda is one of those who abstain 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.239
 he is and even 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.590
 and if you asked him what the actor's name was like 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.429
 maybe I do not know if I will be 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.519
 so I think even in another series 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.569
 as it currently happens 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.769
 ef 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.349
 He put everything to waste. 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.349
 I have nothing to do with what was seen of the scorecard the command 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.819
 the goalkeeper of this Wednesday 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.979
 the document had some color difficulty for the sport because it did not 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.109
 maybe the slightly different character cold we lost two 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.049
 may have some difficulty because it relied on someone to 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.529
 It was for him at the time I think I got on very well with him because 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.909
 I like characters in the cinema. 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.920
 and he's really a cold guy a guy who thinks before he talks 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.039
 15 I will not compare to him but 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.959
 The interpretation of him served well for me. I wish I had failed 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.909
 business well did not know if I did well but did the way I wanted to do 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.020
 journey in the stars of so-called crackers 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.620
 so far 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.690
 the recognition occurred with concord plates was by phone 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.499
 now I think you 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.720
 and anyone who saw bock voice actor air 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.979
 thrown 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.379
 Why the patience that you have will tell you 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.300
 You deserve a statue, each one sees the board. 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.139
 the player got six points 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.219
 in that time that you of the plan of the classic series already exists something 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.900
 similar to the movement one thing only 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.659
 if I had knowledge I would not 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.239
 he has this movement is very old of the United States 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.699
 and it's solidifying here in Brazil that you think that's what you think 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.539
 of this 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.210
 it's a group of people 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.680
 who are fans 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.349
 is a series that you of the block has already been worldwide 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.289
 famous 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.330
 I think it's so spectacular that inside this helinho list 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.740
 think it is 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.320
 if you hurt the french frigate italia okay 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.219
 1 the pain 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 the actor 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.300
 the actor 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.960
 leonardo nimoy 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.990
 a nursery 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.789
 application 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.789
 a perfect 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.210
 nor the defect 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.199
 a punch to 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.919
 with the decision so much that I would like to have a quality the quality not having 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.839
 defects 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.389
 by left dior 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.839
 want to rely on the attacker every 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.990
 the music style 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.639
 it is music but of all turkey maritime everything is the planet music 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.330
 certain time each song is a bit smaller 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.520
 it's too much pressure 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 your moment 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.759
 to be here with you 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.539
 These reinforce the party. 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.029
 a sadness 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.029
 a sadness 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.360
 it was these people 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.400
 plus one you lose a lot of companies that emit carbon donated 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 so long 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.020
 and I even think the frames 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.020
 the background 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.289
 she 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.219
 do not waste time with the move 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.069
 hey las vegas 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.360
 the cost practiced playing on those machines 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.330
 on Wednesday 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.879
 gracias if you were given the chance of you siri 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.610
 there was some kind of agreement 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.830
 who creates is because the network 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.089
 because 

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:39.569
 of glory 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.399
 again to 

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.089
 classic series 

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:46.089
 I am not an agreement with pt and anyone with any 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.490
 I always had to chase him. 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.969
 journey I would be there with more pleasure 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:55.740
 in the area thiago I wanted you to finish 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.740
 How is it that the sport? 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.830
 analyzing logically I can only say 

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:08.020

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.690
 and I hope the staff at home has enjoyed it as much as our 

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.240
 interview
