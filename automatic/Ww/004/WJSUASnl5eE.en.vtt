00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
the changes in cataclysm which I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.210 
the changes in cataclysm which I
actually<00:00:57.470> like<00:00:57.980> really<00:00:58.340> much<00:00:59.830> sometimes<00:01:00.830> with

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
actually like really much sometimes with

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.130 
actually like really much sometimes with
the<00:01:01.430> Warlocks<00:01:01.850> get<00:01:02.090> like<00:01:04.330> really<00:01:05.330> nerves<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
the Warlocks get like really nerves and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.100 
the Warlocks get like really nerves and
all<00:01:06.290> but<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:07.340> must<00:01:07.820> say<00:01:07.909> Blizzard<00:01:08.659> did<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.869> really

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
all but I must say Blizzard did a really

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.350 
all but I must say Blizzard did a really
good<00:01:09.290> job<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:11.690> thing<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.290> most

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
good job the thing I like the most

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.050 
good job the thing I like the most
actually<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.510> not<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:15.050> spell<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.980> new<00:01:16.520> talent

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
actually is not a spell or a new talent

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.110 
actually is not a spell or a new talent
or<00:01:17.560> but<00:01:18.560> our<00:01:19.030> soul<00:01:20.030> sharks<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:22.430> use<00:01:22.670> like

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
or but our soul sharks that we use like

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.350 
or but our soul sharks that we use like
a<00:01:23.150> lot<00:01:23.950> they<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.130> now<00:01:25.370> not<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:25.730> our<00:01:26.060> bags

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
a lot they are now not in our bags

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.580 
a lot they are now not in our bags
anymore<00:01:26.720> it's<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.930> can<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.140> compare<00:01:30.470> it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
anymore it's like what can I compare it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.020 
anymore it's like what can I compare it
with<00:01:31.300> with<00:01:32.300> with<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.840> definite<00:01:33.380> his<00:01:33.590> rooms<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:34.250> I

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
with with with a definite his rooms I I

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.000 
with with with a definite his rooms I I
guess<00:01:35.540> it's<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.290> when<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:36.680> not<00:01:36.830> just

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
guess it's like that when I'm not just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.899 
guess it's like that when I'm not just
actually<00:01:37.520> quite<00:01:38.120> sure<00:01:38.390> cuz<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:40.550> doesn't

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
actually quite sure cuz it it doesn't

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.969 
actually quite sure cuz it it doesn't
say<00:01:41.120> that<00:01:41.150> much<00:01:41.570> about<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:44.830> well<00:01:45.830> it

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
say that much about it so well it

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:57.280 
say that much about it so well it
actually<00:01:46.580> said<00:01:47.570> that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.280 

where's<00:01:58.290> instead<00:01:58.800> well<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> surely<00:02:00.540> will<00:02:00.900> not

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
where's instead well it surely will not

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
where's instead well it surely will not
be<00:02:01.500> longer<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> inventory<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.970> that's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
be longer in the inventory so that's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
be longer in the inventory so that's
good<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.710> UI<00:02:08.640> resource

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
good it's a it will now be a UI resource

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.570 
good it's a it will now be a UI resource
so<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.140> probably<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.800> somewhere<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.430> our

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
so it will probably be somewhere on our

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.920 
so it will probably be somewhere on our
screen<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.959> guessing<00:02:13.790> above<00:02:14.790> our<00:02:15.060> avatar

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
screen and I'm guessing above our avatar

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.060 
screen and I'm guessing above our avatar
I<00:02:16.170> guess<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.700> what<00:02:20.700> else<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.860> go

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
I guess so what else I'm not going to go

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.040 
I guess so what else I'm not going to go
over<00:02:23.750> every<00:02:25.580> new<00:02:26.580> thing<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.209> get<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.750> our

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
over every new thing that we get in our

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.470 
over every new thing that we get in our
talent<00:02:28.560> tree<00:02:28.739> because<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.220> would<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.670> ages

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.680 

now<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:35.220> cool<00:02:35.489> new<00:02:35.760> spell

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
now we also get a really cool new spell

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.010 
now we also get a really cool new spell
that's<00:02:37.530> called<00:02:37.920> fel<00:02:38.310> flame<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:39.870> we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
that's called fel flame and actually we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's called fel flame and actually we
didn't<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.640> spell<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.300> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
didn't really have a spell like that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.160 
didn't really have a spell like that
yeah<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.440> count<00:02:44.270> decimate<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:45.989> an

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
yeah if you can count decimate that's an

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.949 
yeah if you can count decimate that's an

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
that you can compare it to the major

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.070 
that you can compare it to the major
ability<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> from<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.640> fire<00:03:02.850> frostbolt<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.049> i

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
ability to from the fire frostbolt so i

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.490 
ability to from the fire frostbolt so i
guess<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.769> will<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:05.390> one<00:03:06.390> really<00:03:07.290> powerful

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
guess it will be one really powerful

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.410 
guess it will be one really powerful
ability<00:03:10.500> which<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.579> really<00:03:11.820> cool<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.860> pvp

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
ability which is really cool in pvp

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.199 
ability which is really cool in pvp
probably<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.019> will<00:03:16.310> surely<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.549> used<00:03:17.970> in

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209

probably and it will surely be used in
PvE<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:20.310> don't<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:23.100> oh<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.150> will<00:03:24.329> refresh

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810

that's<00:03:27.780> good<00:03:28.049> that's<00:03:28.860> nice

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.250 

okay<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.270> what<00:03:34.660> else<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:36.190> Dark<00:03:37.060> Intent<00:03:37.270> and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that's kind of strange spell because it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.050 
that's kind of strange spell because it
increases<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.200> targets<00:03:41.980> chance<00:03:42.670> for<00:03:43.030> a
