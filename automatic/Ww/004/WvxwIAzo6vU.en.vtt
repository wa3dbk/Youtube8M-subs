a<00:02:45.430> good<00:02:45.640> defense<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.180> mean<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> best

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
a good defense I mean this is the best

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
defense in the game I'm gonna use the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
defense in the game I'm gonna use the
niners<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> tournament<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.140> mean<00:02:50.770> I'm<00:02:50.860> not

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
niners in the tournament I mean I'm not

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
the best team on defense and therefore I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.820 
the best team on defense and therefore I
that's<00:02:55.660> why<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.840> always<00:02:55.960> choose<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.350> nice<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.770> a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
that's why I always choose a nice on a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.950 
that's why I always choose a nice on a
game<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.160> right<00:02:57.880> here<00:02:58.150> he<00:02:58.300> hit<00:02:58.510> me<00:02:58.720> hard
