towards that target

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.929 
towards that target
you're<00:01:45.079> also<00:01:45.229> generating<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.159> lot<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.640> torque

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
you're also generating a lot of torque

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.850 
you're also generating a lot of torque
through<00:01:47.659> your<00:01:47.840> body<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> upper<00:01:48.710> body

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
through your body so the upper body

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.529 
through your body so the upper body
which<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.369> next<00:01:49.549> plane<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.939> second<00:01:50.360> here

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
which on the next plane is second here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.760 
which on the next plane is second here
is<00:01:50.630> creating<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.350> work<00:01:51.530> when<00:01:51.679> you're

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
is creating that to work when you're

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.310 
is creating that to work when you're
moving<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.700> circular<00:01:52.970> manner<00:01:53.299> but<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
moving in a circular manner but the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.350 
moving in a circular manner but the
lower<00:01:54.530> body<00:01:54.770> when<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:55.490> drive<00:01:55.729> forward<00:01:56.210> your

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
lower body when you drive forward your

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.929 
lower body when you drive forward your
hips<00:01:56.600> are<00:01:57.409> gonna<00:01:57.590> explode<00:01:58.310> through<00:01:58.729> they're

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
hips are gonna explode through they're

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
push off that leg explode through your

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.550 
push off that leg explode through your
front<00:02:11.150> foot<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.450> gonna<00:02:11.540> open<00:02:11.959> if<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.230> open

and you're kept and clear through okay
so<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:18.349> up<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> upper<00:02:19.700> body<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.480> is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
so now up to the upper body this is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
so now up to the upper body this is
where<00:02:20.810> things<00:02:21.049> get<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.260> little<00:02:21.380> bit

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
where things get a little bit

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.380 
where things get a little bit
complicated<00:02:21.860> here<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.489> where<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> see<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.330> lot

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
complicated here and where I see a lot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.050 
complicated here and where I see a lot
of<00:02:23.540> mistakes<00:02:23.799> so<00:02:24.799> just<00:02:25.160> it'll<00:02:25.700> take<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> little

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
of mistakes so just it'll take a little

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.839 
of mistakes so just it'll take a little
while<00:02:26.180> ends<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.170> once<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.410> get<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.620> down

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
while ends but once you get it down

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.860 
while ends but once you get it down
everything's<00:02:28.849> moving<00:02:29.090> together<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> same

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
everything's moving together at the same

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.479 
everything's moving together at the same
time<00:02:30.110> lower<00:02:30.440> body<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.830> upper<00:02:30.890> body<00:02:31.069> it's

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
time lower body and upper body it's

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.160 
time lower body and upper body it's
pretty<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:32.360> know<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.569> pretty<00:02:32.720> easy<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.049> do

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
pretty you know it's pretty easy to do

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.600 
pretty you know it's pretty easy to do
with<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.349> practice<00:02:33.739> okay<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.130> we're<00:02:34.519> gonna

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
with the practice okay so we're gonna

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.690 
with the practice okay so we're gonna
start<00:02:35.030> first<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.930> all<00:02:36.049> our<00:02:36.230> hands<00:02:36.650> rich<00:02:37.400> shot

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
start first of all our hands rich shot

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.840 
start first of all our hands rich shot
about<00:02:38.239> 12<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.720> 16<00:02:38.900> inches<00:02:39.380> apart<00:02:39.799> slap<00:02:40.549> shot

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
about 12 to 16 inches apart slap shot

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.340 
about 12 to 16 inches apart slap shot
you<00:02:41.269> know<00:02:41.390> you're<00:02:41.540> gonna<00:02:41.630> come<00:02:41.900> down<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.109> little

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
you know you're gonna come down a little

through that torque comes through and

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.780 
through that torque comes through and
that's<00:04:09.770> going<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:09.980> create<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.250> lot<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.430> power<00:04:10.700> on

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
that's going to create a lot of power on

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.880 
that's going to create a lot of power on
my<00:04:10.940> shot<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.240> once<00:04:12.140> again<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.470> don't<00:04:12.590> turn

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
my shot so once again you don't turn

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.770 
my shot so once again you don't turn
your<00:04:13.010> wrist<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:13.850> go<00:04:14.000> take<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.330> upper<00:04:14.570> body

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
your wrist just go take the upper body

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.680 
your wrist just go take the upper body
then<00:04:15.590> your<00:04:15.800> your<00:04:16.160> backswing<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:17.120> lot<00:04:17.419> of<00:04:17.510> kids

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
then your your backswing a lot of kids

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.940 
then your your backswing a lot of kids
will<00:04:17.810> come<00:04:17.959> way<00:04:18.109> up<00:04:18.140> here<00:04:18.560> almost<00:04:18.799> like

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
will come way up here almost like

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.440 
will come way up here almost like
they're<00:04:19.190> scratching<00:04:19.549> their<00:04:19.760> back<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.299> their
