00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.120
 you make a new makeup tutorial 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.830
 on mr jack i hope you like it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.010
 it's not too complicated to do it 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
 just a little bit of patience so for 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 start we will take the painting 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 white fardel pro make-up we're going 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 apply with a brush thoroughly 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 especially dyes our face avoiding the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 around the eyes because after we go 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:35.790
 put the black once you're done 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 will give a cost of his choice 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.239
 iron a second layer and then 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.239
 we go back to the dryer 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 then we take a powder brush and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 we will apply our white powder 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.910
 for a good finish 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 once we've done that we'll take 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.910
 so our brush 14 aces make up 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 for ever and our sephora palette and we 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.460
 will make the shadows by applying a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.460
 gay lighthouse 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.390
 so we continue the shadows and then 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.830
 we will dim our shadows with a brush 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.830
 from mac 217 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.790
 so we will continue the shadows 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.830
 with a smaller brush and we're going 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.830
 so do his expressions 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.950
 and then always staying with the mcs 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.950
 217 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 listen 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.849
 me 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.530
 we continue again November so this 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.049
 this time it is below 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.310
 the eye and always leaving with 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.310
 our 217 mac 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.360
 then we'll do the shadows of 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:09.310
 nostrils so we trace small circles 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:11.170
 over our nose then so I 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.080
 take my black paint that I'm going 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.860
 put so in a container here I 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.570
 took a box and with one imports a 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.350
 paintbrush might disappoint 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:33.060
 we will draw the outline of the eyes and 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.060
 then we will fill it 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.600
 once we have finished that we dry at 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 dryer so that it does not make 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.090
 marks but we will still ironed 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.090
 a layer and 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.579
 and then we dry his shorts then 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.620
 we take a smaller brush to 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.170
 paint control in black paint 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:07.230
 and we will vote so it's a benchmark for 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:09.680
 to make our pocket then we trace our 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.680
 line 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 so this line will go through both 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.810
 points and then by the page and we can 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.960
 of course correct our mistakes with a 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.960
 Cotton stalk by blurring the edges 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.650
 then we always take the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.169
 same brushes with the same paint and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.500
 we will trace the sewing species 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.500
 that there is on the mouth of mr jack 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.990
 so once we've done that we take 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.810
 a cotton swab and we're going dimmed so 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.290
 our and to have an effect more 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.290
 realistic 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.340
 after doing that of course we can 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.010
 so ironing our and for it to be 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.250
 well done and so we will do our 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.760
 nostrils being north to have more 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.760
 more depth 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.599
 and that's the makeup is over so 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.210
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:55.400
 can do them for halloween 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.400
 and that's good evening
