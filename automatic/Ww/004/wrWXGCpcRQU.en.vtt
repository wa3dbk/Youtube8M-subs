00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in that game that I don't think that was

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920 
in that game that I don't think that was
in<00:01:13.049> resistance<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.540> they<00:01:15.540> took<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> out

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in resistance to really they took it out

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.249 
in resistance to really they took it out
yeah<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.920> weird<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.970> after<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.540> through
