00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
boy so once you close out of it it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.550 
boy so once you close out of it it
starts<00:01:07.710> over<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.280> sometimes<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.600> accidentally

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
starts over and sometimes I accidentally

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
starts over and sometimes I accidentally
press<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> closes<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:12.990> not

press it and so it closes and that's not

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.940 
press it and so it closes and that's not
really<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.830> greatest<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:15.950> hopefully

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
really the greatest but hopefully

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.219 
really the greatest but hopefully
they'll<00:01:17.130> come<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> workaround

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
they'll come out with a workaround

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
they'll come out with a workaround
around<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:21.240> called<00:01:21.450> gear<00:01:21.750> boy<00:01:21.900> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
around that so it's called gear boy so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.210 
around that so it's called gear boy so
