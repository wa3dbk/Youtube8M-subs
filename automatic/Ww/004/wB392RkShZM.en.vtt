need to pull off these tricks on the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.980 
need to pull off these tricks on the
snow<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.060> first<00:01:31.390> started<00:01:31.750> training

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
snow when I first started training

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.320 
snow when I first started training
presses<00:01:32.440> off<00:01:32.619> snow<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.190> did<00:01:33.640> find<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.000> hard<00:01:34.240> to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
presses off snow I did find it hard to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.630 
presses off snow I did find it hard to
get<00:01:34.570> deep<00:01:34.810> into<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.200> press<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:36.190> practice

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
get deep into the press and to practice

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.880 
get deep into the press and to practice
for<00:01:36.760> very<00:01:37.000> long<00:01:37.270> but<00:01:37.869> each<00:01:38.020> time<00:01:38.260> I<00:01:38.320> practiced

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
for very long but each time I practiced

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.219 
for very long but each time I practiced
it<00:01:39.130> became<00:01:39.430> easier<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.970> press<00:01:40.150> my<00:01:40.390> board<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.110> I

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
it became easier to press my board and I

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.350 
it became easier to press my board and I
was<00:01:41.320> able<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.710> train<00:01:42.040> longer<00:01:45.360> offseason

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
was able to train longer offseason

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.969 
was able to train longer offseason
training<00:01:46.509> will<00:01:46.810> pay<00:01:47.020> off<00:01:47.200> when<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.530> comes<00:01:47.740> time

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
training will pay off when it comes time

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.160 
training will pay off when it comes time
