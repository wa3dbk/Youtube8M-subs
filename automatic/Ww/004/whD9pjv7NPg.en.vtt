00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.850
 I'll show you another world today 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 I have built a trade center 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.150
 a total of 24 floors approximately 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 Five blocks are under input 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 eight blocks high the mass of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.369
 floor area is 31 31 blocks where 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 I have the app blocks in this case 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.820
 beacon replaces this one 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 optional the width of these steps 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.010
 3 is all others besides 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.750
 4 high up the two steps 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 these are stone cdu meet the other one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 here are iron blocks which then the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 columns form a page stop three 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 next to each other otherwise 4 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.770
 the whole thing goes up two and ended 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.079
 on a platform all around it 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.149
 and then we're done 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.250
 inside I have between the outside 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 pillars and the interior I have then 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 three traveling blocks released 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.500
 that are still around and then have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.020
 I'm all of the three blocks, so to speak 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.750
 I then set a pillar with 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 There was a sound in it and over the three 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 which doors I then in the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 I put a glass of free space 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.460
 packed photo other will also be comfortable 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 can run in 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.740
 it's all identical and goes once 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.040
 around 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.220
 then we go in there I have 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.079
 then made a small room which 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.840
 in total up to the columns 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.689
 five blocks are free 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.159
 These were supposed to be elevators 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.829
 since I do not do everything with redstone 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.130
 et cetera I want to build it 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.350
 then equipped with ladders two 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.909
 blocks outside then the door three blocks 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.720
 free one more door and two again 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 blocks outside 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 the pages are closed and with no luck 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.180
 sound so you also neat 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.920
 bright then we'll take a quick look 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.090
 with a pressure plate goes in and then 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.110
 here we have a ladder for it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.970
 we come from floor to floor 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.990
 then i have a little iron here 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.330
 block set 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.130
 Tyranny usually comes in well too 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 on a pressure plate with it again 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 approaching 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 I do not have the interior here yet 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.970
 Build-up 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.350
 That's up to you if I like now 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.870
 in the original tower then office yes like soot 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 reinbauen want or just a hotel 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.170
 that's what makes a good one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.090
 possibility would be I'll go 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.280
 back down to you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.600
 exterior facade and the construction of the individual 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.200
 floors show so then I fly 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.230
 short time around to see something better 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.420
 can be eight pieces from the outside 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.050
 entrance area large end of the in 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.960
 a little extra something small 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.320
 roof over the entrance area together 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.400
 The floors are five blocks 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.140
 big and loads the second block is with 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.900
 a black glass pane provided 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.470
 which is four blocks high then 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.820
 whole then pulls over this 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.660
 glass panes then bolle the next 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.990
 floor again new floor and four 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.880
 high bell then we build the whole 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.550
 just keep on going 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.560
 then parrots in it will be easy too 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.660
 you always increase what you are at the top 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.030
 arrived are short of the wedge 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.100
 because there are a total of 24 floors 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.210
 five and at the very top here is the fire 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.960
 From the corners, I then have a first 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.520
 flat roof made that can of course 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.110
 still leave with a send or 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.850
 equip similar 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.610
 but I think that's so good 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.650
 and I have that just from this 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.570
 Just put a corner over this corner 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.600
 block further inland offset land 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.300
 drawn if you do it as easy as 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.360
 you keep beautiful here 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.410
 the world trade center tower so it is 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.500
 Not hard 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.620
 and if somebody has world edit it works 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 also pretty easy by then 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.109
 simply a floor is copied and that is 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.950
 I've always done that 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.840
 block next to the first glass pane 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.980
 copied down to the opposite one 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.150
 page 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.800
 and I always have two blocks 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.860
 have set including an old block 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.600
 so set up and then have that from 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.460
 copied from here and always inserted 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.500
 blog continues to fly high 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.630
 again do not put a block again 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.090
 put it up and put it back like that 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 everything stays in order as it should be 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.070
 to and the copy of the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240
 monastery and the ladder so has with me 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.280
 wonderfully worked 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.100
 Overall, it does not take much then 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.010
 long until you get there fast and easy 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.750
 the world trade center tower has it 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:10.250
 do not look too bad ok then 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.250
 see you next tutorial
