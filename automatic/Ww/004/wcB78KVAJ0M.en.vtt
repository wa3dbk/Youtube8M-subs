spikes<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.219> trap<00:01:34.490> chest<00:01:34.819> i'm<00:01:35.060> going<00:01:35.179> to

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
spikes in the trap chest i'm going to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.539 
spikes in the trap chest i'm going to
the<00:01:35.359> copy<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.049> spikes<00:01:36.770> first<00:01:37.069> basically

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
the copy of the spikes first basically

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.019 
the copy of the spikes first basically
get<00:01:37.729> spikes<00:01:38.090> are<00:01:38.420> they<00:01:39.259> give<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.039> damage<00:01:40.520> when

get spikes are they give you damage when

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.629 
get spikes are they give you damage when
you<00:01:41.179> trample<00:01:41.630> them<00:01:41.779> and<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.069> it's<00:01:43.369> like

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 
you trample them and you know it's like

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.279 
you trample them and you know it's like
you're<00:01:43.849> good<00:01:44.060> way<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.329> make<00:01:44.539> like<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.749> trap<00:01:45.079> and

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
you're good way to make like a trap and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.139 
you're good way to make like a trap and
I<00:01:45.349> ground<00:01:45.649> or<00:01:45.799> something<00:01:46.009> like<00:01:46.069> that<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.939> I'm

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
I ground or something like that so I'm

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.959 
I ground or something like that so I'm
next<00:01:47.749> is<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.109> trap<00:01:48.740> chest<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.310> made<00:01:49.939> just

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
next is the trap chest it's made just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.399 
next is the trap chest it's made just
like<00:01:50.179> so<00:01:50.539> what<00:01:51.079> this<00:01:51.259> chap<00:01:51.560> says<00:01:51.799> does<00:01:52.099> is<00:01:52.490> on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
like so what this chap says does is on

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.379 
like so what this chap says does is on
basically<00:01:54.409> think<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.829> it<00:01:54.979> as<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.459> our<00:01:56.149> red<00:01:56.359> zone

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
basically think of it as a our red zone

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.309 
basically think of it as a our red zone
power<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.740> like<00:01:57.829> am<00:01:58.539> like<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.569> lever<00:01:59.899> or<00:02:00.259> a

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
power just like am like a lever or a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.289 
power just like am like a lever or a
button<00:02:00.799> or<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.039> pressure<00:02:01.310> plate<00:02:01.549> would<00:02:01.849> would

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
button or a pressure plate would would

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.510 
button or a pressure plate would would
do<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.749> does<00:02:03.109> the<00:02:03.259> same<00:02:03.289> thing<00:02:03.679> so<00:02:04.219> over<00:02:04.369> here

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
do it does the same thing so over here

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.580 
do it does the same thing so over here
we<00:02:04.609> r<00:02:04.639> demonstration<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:06.049> normal<00:02:06.380> door

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
we r demonstration like a normal door

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.440 
we r demonstration like a normal door
would<00:02:06.829> need<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.249> like<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.849> button<00:02:08.270> right<00:02:08.420> there

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
would need a like a button right there

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.569 
would need a like a button right there
or<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> pressure<00:02:09.259> plate<00:02:09.439> right<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.369> now

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
or a pressure plate right there but now

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.780 
or a pressure plate right there but now
you<00:02:10.640> guys<00:02:10.909> can<00:02:11.060> change<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.510> up<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:12.760> now<00:02:13.760> you're

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you guys can change it up and now you're

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.830 
you guys can change it up and now you're
able<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.390> this

make it harder to get inside this room
you<00:02:18.950> guys<00:02:19.099> cannot<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.760> put<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.150> trap

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you guys cannot you know put this trap

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.940 
you guys cannot you know put this trap
test<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.959> got<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:21.590> click<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
and then you get was powered and your

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.020 
and then you get was powered and your
could<00:02:24.230> again<00:02:24.470> turn<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.830> off<00:02:24.950> over<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:25.849> i<00:02:25.940> have

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
could again turn it off over here i have

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.729 
could again turn it off over here i have
the<00:02:26.300> spikes<00:02:26.599> set<00:02:26.900> up<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.590> little

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the spikes set up just that little

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.320 
the spikes set up just that little
demonstration<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:30.580> basically<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.879> Tramp<00:02:32.180> on

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
demonstration and basically is Tramp on

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.420 
demonstration and basically is Tramp on
them<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.780> gives<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.049> damage<00:02:33.440> sim<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.370> can

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
them and it gives you damage sim you can

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.570 
them and it gives you damage sim you can
use<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.239> mob<00:02:35.510> trap<00:02:36.319> or<00:02:36.650> like<00:02:37.549> a

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
use it as like a mob trap or like a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.880 
use it as like a mob trap or like a
human<00:02:38.030> trap<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.690> whatever<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.440> can<00:02:39.560> be

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
human trap or whatever you can be

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.710 
human trap or whatever you can be
treated<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.790> do<00:02:41.360> something<00:02:41.390> better

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
treated with it and do something better

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.380 
treated with it and do something better
than<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.019> did<00:02:42.080> next<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.830> lastly<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.549> sticky

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
than I did next and lastly is the sticky

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
than I did next and lastly is the sticky
sense<00:02:44.750> sticky<00:02:45.260> gravel<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.799> may<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.250> like

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
sense sticky gravel with may just like

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.160 
sense sticky gravel with may just like
this<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.910> obviously<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.569> make<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.840> sticky

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
this and obviously the make it sticky

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.160 
this and obviously the make it sticky
gravel<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:48.920> gotta<00:02:49.160> do<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.540> know<00:02:50.630> swap<00:02:50.989> out

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
gravel I just gotta do you know swap out

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.259 
gravel I just gotta do you know swap out
the<00:02:51.349> sand<00:02:51.620> for<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.920> gravel<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.090> does

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the sand for the gravel but what it does

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.030 
the sand for the gravel but what it does
is<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.019> how<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.230> when<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.709> place

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
is you know how you when you place

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000 
is you know how you when you place
gravel<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.819> sin<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.780> normally<00:02:57.200> falls<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:57.829> now

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
gravel and sin it normally falls but now

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.520 
gravel and sin it normally falls but now
it<00:02:58.250> doesn't<00:02:58.579> fall<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.599> now<00:02:59.840> what<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.170> can<00:03:00.200> do

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
it doesn't fall so now what you can do

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.839 
it doesn't fall so now what you can do
as<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.280> can<00:03:01.670> um<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.920> can<00:03:04.069> make<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> trap<00:03:04.549> like

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
as you can um you can make a trap like

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.869 
as you can um you can make a trap like
so<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.349> basically<00:03:06.650> i'll<00:03:06.920> place<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.370> sand<00:03:07.670> in

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
so so basically i'll place the sand in

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.850 
so so basically i'll place the sand in
this<00:03:07.970> gravel<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:08.959> won't<00:03:09.230> fall<00:03:09.530> it's

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
this gravel and it won't fall it's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.589 
this gravel and it won't fall it's
powered<00:03:10.220> by<00:03:10.250> redstone<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.239> want<00:03:11.450> the

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
powered by redstone so if you want the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.630 
powered by redstone so if you want the
fall<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.440> make<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> fall<00:03:12.920> over<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.310> big

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
fall you can make a fall over like a big

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.839 
fall you can make a fall over like a big
hole<00:03:13.970> or<00:03:14.299> on<00:03:15.110> top<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.620> spikes<00:03:15.950> or<00:03:16.220> whatever<00:03:16.489> so

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
hole or on top of spikes or whatever so

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.300 
hole or on top of spikes or whatever so
you<00:03:17.060> know<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.680> set<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:18.950> there's

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
you know you can have it set so there's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.280 
you know you can have it set so there's
a<00:03:19.400> pressure<00:03:19.639> plate<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.269> can<00:03:20.840> step<00:03:21.019> on<00:03:21.200> tight

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
a pressure plate I can step on tight

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.620 
a pressure plate I can step on tight
right<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.739> pressure<00:03:21.980> plate<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.549> I<00:03:23.030> fall

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
right on the pressure plate and I fall

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.360 
right on the pressure plate and I fall
so<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.200> mean<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.739> have<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.040> set<00:03:25.190> up<00:03:25.250> in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
so I mean you can have it set up in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.949 
so I mean you can have it set up in
different<00:03:25.519> ways<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:25.910> make<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.690> useful

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
different ways and make it really useful

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.259 
different ways and make it really useful
but<00:03:27.709> that's<00:03:27.889> different<00:03:28.069> small<00:03:28.609> guys<00:03:28.850> hope<00:03:29.090> you
