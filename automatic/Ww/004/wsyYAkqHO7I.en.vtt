the next slide which is missing okay
here's<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> question<00:00:16.699> where<00:00:17.699> their<00:00:17.940> hurdles

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
here's the question where their hurdles

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.019 
here's the question where their hurdles
that<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> encountered<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:20.340> related<00:00:20.850> more

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that you encountered that related more

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
that you encountered that related more
towards<00:00:21.449> any<00:00:21.660> underlying<00:00:22.020> principles<00:00:22.710> with

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
towards any underlying principles with

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.849 
towards any underlying principles with
design<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.490> were<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.119> technical<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.779> nature

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
design or were they technical in nature

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
design or were they technical in nature
also<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:26.250> aspects<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.939> new<00:00:27.029> character

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
also what aspects of new character

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
also what aspects of new character
models<00:00:27.720> turned<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> easiest<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
models turned out to be the easiest to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.420 
models turned out to be the easiest to
address<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.430> technical

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
address so one of the technical

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.330 
address so one of the technical
challenges<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.390> faced<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.620> facial

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
challenges that we faced was the facial

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880 
challenges that we faced was the facial
hair<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:37.110> weren't<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.649> were<00:00:37.739> gonna

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
hair we we weren't sure if we were gonna

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
hair we we weren't sure if we were gonna
have<00:00:38.040> enough<00:00:38.219> bones<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> animate<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
have enough bones to animate the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
have enough bones to animate the
individual<00:00:39.809> pieces<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> hair<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
individual pieces of the hair so a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
individual pieces of the hair so a
technical<00:00:42.600> artist<00:00:43.200> came<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
technical artist came up with this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
technical artist came up with this
solution<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.340> us<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> time

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
solution for us at the time

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
solution for us at the time
so<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> checker<00:00:46.530> geometry<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> you're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so the checker geometry that you're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
so the checker geometry that you're
seeing<00:00:47.809> represents<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> beard<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.039> mustache

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
seeing represents the beard the mustache

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910 
seeing represents the beard the mustache
and<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> sideburns<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.649> follow

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and the sideburns so it's gonna follow

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
and the sideburns so it's gonna follow
the<00:00:53.250> characters<00:00:54.030> body<00:00:54.180> movements<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the characters body movements and this

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
the characters body movements and this
helps<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> hair<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.940> retain<00:00:57.480> its<00:00:57.719> shape

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
helps for the hair to retain its shape

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.189 
helps for the hair to retain its shape
and<00:00:58.170> volume<00:00:59.149> this<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.390> also<00:01:00.690> help<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and volume this will also help to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
and volume this will also help to
prevent<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:01.680> displaying<00:01:02.460> any<00:01:02.670> odd

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
prevent it from displaying any odd

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.719 
prevent it from displaying any odd
behavior<00:01:04.010> we<00:01:05.010> should<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.280> used<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.549> for

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
behavior we should have used this for

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
behavior we should have used this for
the<00:01:05.790> new<00:01:05.970> player<00:01:06.210> character<00:01:06.659> redo<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.830> be

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the new player character redo that be

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
the new player character redo that be
perfect<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> end<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:11.010> able<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
perfect what in the end we were able to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
perfect what in the end we were able to
get<00:01:11.400> enough<00:01:11.490> bones<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> animate<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> facial

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
get enough bones to animate the facial

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.670 
get enough bones to animate the facial
hair<00:01:14.540> one<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> biggest<00:01:16.049> challenges<00:01:16.470> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hair one of the biggest challenges for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.140 
hair one of the biggest challenges for
us<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.420> preserving<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> existing<00:01:19.020> animations

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
us is preserving the existing animations

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.140 
us is preserving the existing animations
these<00:01:21.150> help<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.490> establish<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> look<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
these help to establish the look and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520 
these help to establish the look and
feel<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> characters<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.409> you've

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
feel for the characters that you've

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
feel for the characters that you've
grown<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.950> love

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
grown to love

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.160 
grown to love
so<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> see<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.979> current<00:01:29.430> model

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so here you see the current model

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.190 
so here you see the current model
and<00:01:31.259> here's<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.189> updated<00:01:32.549> dwarf<00:01:33.110> let's<00:01:34.110> see

he's got a lot more detail a lot more
character<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> his<00:01:36.869> face<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.400> been

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
character to his face and he's just been

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.190 
character to his face and he's just been
brought<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.330> same<00:01:39.659> level<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> quality

brought up to the same level of quality

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.180 
brought up to the same level of quality
as<00:01:40.590> our<00:01:40.740> Panda<00:01:41.159> models<00:01:44.090> here's<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.240> example<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
as our Panda models here's an example of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.830 
as our Panda models here's an example of
preserving<00:01:47.190> his<00:01:47.280> animation<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.539> can<00:01:48.570> see

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
preserving his animation you can see

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
preserving his animation you can see
we're<00:01:48.990> still<00:01:49.020> trying<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> keep<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> same

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
we're still trying to keep that same

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
we're still trying to keep that same
feel<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> dwarf<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
feel and look of the dwarf but we just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.679 
feel and look of the dwarf but we just
add<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.190> little<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.640> weight<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.210> loosened<00:01:54.600> up

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
add a little more weight and loosened up

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
add a little more weight and loosened up
his<00:01:54.810> body<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:56.039> can<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.340> his<00:01:56.670> facial<00:01:56.880> hair<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
his body you can see his facial hair is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.340 
his body you can see his facial hair is
moving<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.310> current<00:01:59.640> model<00:01:59.960> wasn't<00:02:00.960> really

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
moving the current model wasn't really

can see the updated model with the
additional<00:02:05.640> geometry<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.390> able<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.310> handle

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
additional geometry it's able to handle

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
additional geometry it's able to handle
that<00:02:10.850> some<00:02:11.850> animations<00:02:12.390> were<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.739> not

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that some animations were just not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
that some animations were just not
coming<00:02:14.130> across<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.519> well<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> animators

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
coming across very well so the animators

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.979 
coming across very well so the animators
wanted<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.350> punch<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.160> their<00:02:17.310> personality

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.289 

some<00:02:21.989> animations<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.970> by<00:02:24.090> adding

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
some animations just just by adding

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.600 
some animations just just by adding
expression<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.260> animating<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> hair<00:02:26.340> just

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
expression and animating the hair just

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
expression and animating the hair just
really<00:02:26.880> helped<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> make<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.480> pop<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.900> lot

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
really helped to make it pop out a lot

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.660 
really helped to make it pop out a lot
more

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 

and<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> choose<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.990> customize<00:02:34.170> without<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
and if you choose to customize without a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.040 
and if you choose to customize without a
mustache<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> hard<00:02:36.810> work

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
mustache you can see all the hard work

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:49.760 
mustache you can see all the hard work
the<00:02:37.260> animators<00:02:37.650> put<00:02:37.860> into<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.130> face

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.699 

so<00:02:50.770> same<00:02:51.250> process<00:02:51.730> with<00:02:51.940> with<00:02:52.330> York<00:02:52.569> his<00:02:53.440> hair

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
so same process with with York his hair

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.309 
so same process with with York his hair
was<00:02:53.950> stuck<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.190> his<00:02:54.459> his<00:02:54.610> body<00:02:54.849> his<00:02:55.720> face<00:02:56.050> was

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
was stuck to his his body his face was

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.949 
was stuck to his his body his face was
looking<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.280> little<00:02:57.400> plain<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.150> he<00:02:58.810> just

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
looking a little plain and he just

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.010 
looking a little plain and he just
needed<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.260> up<00:02:59.440> updated<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.720> his

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
needed to be up updated you can see his

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.900 
needed to be up updated you can see his
hairs<00:03:02.349> detached<00:03:03.099> from<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> body

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
hairs detached from the body

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.300 
hairs detached from the body
he<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.660> looks<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.230> lot<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:05.590> aggressive<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
he just looks a lot more aggressive and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.390 
he just looks a lot more aggressive and
he<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> lot<00:03:07.510> more<00:03:07.540> muscular

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.190 

we<00:03:14.849> got<00:03:15.000> rid<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.360> lot<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> pops<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
we got rid of a lot of the pops and

we got rid of a lot of the pops and
hitches<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.739> were<00:03:16.890> happy<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.849> were

hitches that were happy that were

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.000 
hitches that were happy that were
present<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.480> his<00:03:18.629> animations

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
present in his animations

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.790 
present in his animations
with<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> wok<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.180> really<00:03:22.480> wanted<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.800> increase

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
with a wok we really wanted to increase

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.410 
with a wok we really wanted to increase
his<00:03:23.950> weight<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> little<00:03:24.580> bit<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.209> people

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
his weight a little bit more as people

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.790 
his weight a little bit more as people
feel<00:03:25.750> heavier

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.590 

you<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.250> see<00:03:35.400> we've<00:03:35.610> loosened<00:03:35.820> up<00:03:36.090> his<00:03:36.270> body<00:03:36.480> a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
you can see we've loosened up his body a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
you can see we've loosened up his body a
lot<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.800> all<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.090> characters<00:03:39.990> capes<00:03:40.320> now

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
lot more is all the characters capes now

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
lot more is all the characters capes now
have<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> chain<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.160> bone<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.820> they'll<00:03:42.480> flow

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
have a chain of bone so they'll flow

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.120 
have a chain of bone so they'll flow
more<00:03:42.960> naturally

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.620 

it's<00:03:52.130> same<00:03:52.340> with<00:03:52.370> his<00:03:52.640> his<00:03:52.940> emotes<00:03:53.270> he<00:03:53.450> went

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
it's same with his his emotes he went

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.990 
it's same with his his emotes he went
through<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.870> same<00:03:53.900> same<00:03:54.710> touch-up<00:03:55.100> process

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
through the same same touch-up process

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.810 
through the same same touch-up process
just<00:03:56.270> trying<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.660> steal<00:03:57.530> preserve<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
just trying to steal preserve that the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.480 
just trying to steal preserve that the
existing<00:03:59.240> animation<00:03:59.750> just<00:04:00.500> punching<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.280> up<00:04:01.370> a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
existing animation just punching it up a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.510 
existing animation just punching it up a
lot<00:04:01.700> more<00:04:02.800> animations<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:03.860> didn't<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.220> a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
lot more animations that didn't have a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.090 
lot more animations that didn't have a
whole<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.000> movement<00:04:05.590> now<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.620> have<00:04:06.830> more

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
whole lot of movement now I have more

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:16.300 
whole lot of movement now I have more
fluid<00:04:07.250> motion<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:15.440> here's<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.860> quick<00:04:16.070> glimpse

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
fluid motion and here's a quick glimpse

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.370 
fluid motion and here's a quick glimpse
of<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.670> gnomes<00:04:19.299> by<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.360> point<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> team<00:04:21.080> has

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
of the gnomes by this point the team has

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.490 
of the gnomes by this point the team has
come<00:04:22.340> onto<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.880> gnomes<00:04:23.090> they're<00:04:23.500> they're

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
come onto the gnomes they're they're

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.440 
come onto the gnomes they're they're
comfortable<00:04:25.340> with<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> facial<00:04:25.790> rig<00:04:26.150> they've

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
comfortable with the facial rig they've

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.960 
comfortable with the facial rig they've
applied<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.410> same<00:04:27.620> touch-ups<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.820> the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
applied the same touch-ups with the

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.570 
applied the same touch-ups with the
adding<00:04:29.450> animation<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.050> hair<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.580> he's

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
adding animation to the hair and he's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.810 
adding animation to the hair and he's
just<00:04:31.760> consistent<00:04:32.270> with<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.540> oricon<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.080> dwarf

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.640 

his<00:04:37.820> facial<00:04:38.090> features<00:04:38.300> are<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> lot<00:04:38.960> larger<00:04:39.200> so

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
his facial features are a lot larger so

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
his facial features are a lot larger so
you<00:04:39.680> can<00:04:39.950> really<00:04:40.100> make<00:04:40.310> out<00:04:40.490> those

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
you can really make out those

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:52.709 
you can really make out those
expressions

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:52.719 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.409 

and<00:04:52.809> something<00:04:53.679> is<00:04:53.799> just<00:04:54.489> by<00:04:54.610> adding<00:04:54.879> a<00:04:54.999> facial

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
and something is just by adding a facial

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.239 
and something is just by adding a facial
expression<00:04:55.839> to<00:04:55.959> the<00:04:56.080> dance<00:04:56.289> just<00:04:56.649> helped<00:04:56.889> make

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
expression to the dance just helped make

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.509 
expression to the dance just helped make
it<00:04:57.279> pop<00:04:57.549> out<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:57.759> lot<00:04:57.969> more<00:05:02.009> it<00:05:03.009> makes<00:05:03.219> it<00:05:03.339> pop

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:03.519 
it pop out a lot more it makes it pop

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:08.539 
it pop out a lot more it makes it pop
out<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.729> little<00:05:03.849> I<00:05:04.209> am<00:05:05.129> poor<00:05:06.129> choice<00:05:06.399> of<00:05:06.549> words

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:08.549 
out a little I am poor choice of words

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:11.429
