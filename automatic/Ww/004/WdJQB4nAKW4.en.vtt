00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
that the game's nearly over you can

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.900 
that the game's nearly over you can

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
change the length of games so you can

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.640 
change the length of games so you can
have<00:06:10.030> real<00:06:10.300> epic<00:06:10.600> ones<00:06:10.810> or<00:06:10.990> quite<00:06:11.200> short<00:06:11.470> ones
