00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.660
 For those who do not know I'm good. 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.020
 bicycle mechanics and that was 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 This is due to the lack of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750
 parents 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.079
 any tire bored the bicycle was 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.669
 months stop then this happening only 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.509
 With me but with the parents of everything 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.880
 neighborhood 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.039
 then I became just the mechanics 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.140
 street of tires on my bikes 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.720
 colleagues of the two neighbors and then 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 thing evolved to be able to do with 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.670
 that I do not need any kind of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.400
 external aid when I'm pedaling and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 can do in my house the main 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.620
 basic maintenance 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.780
 so here I have a minimal kit and that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.810
 It's the best I have too. 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.130
 tools I use on a daily basis here 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.180
 a re - tire kit here for you 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:05.820
 put the pedals on the bike here one 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 pump pump suspension very 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 interesting to pump and a bomb you 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.870
 have to try it in the store you pick 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 do so and squeeze if you feel she 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.280
 It's holding the pressure. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.220
 she is potentially good equipment 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.720
 cleaning 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.750
 I'll also tell you how it goes. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.750
 Lubrication Tools Minimum 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.820
 and a kit that I take for all three because 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 here will get you everything from the tire shock 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.860
 a power switch for all 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.080
 types of current diameter has this 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.290
 key case the key case still has 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.960
 until this piece of eight millimeters 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 key allen 8mm important for 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.560
 you pick up pedals and here in 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.130
 rays but only two types of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.490
 rays that are mountain bike and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 in this one the famous 10 mm either 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.679
 I like to use almost everything 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.870
 in 8 and 9 8 and 9 and 10 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.220
 with this you already know what you have to 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.620
 tools at home 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.920
 so our youtube channel and stay 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.990
 connected on www will get the point with 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.990
 because biking is cool
