00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
difference it really doesn't make a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
difference it really doesn't make a
difference<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.569> able<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
the first thing you're going to do is

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.830 
the first thing you're going to do is
slowly<00:02:51.989> remove<00:02:52.560> your<00:02:52.829> lashes<00:02:53.040> cool<00:02:53.970> from<00:02:54.389> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
middle I've learned if you just start

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.819 
middle I've learned if you just start
yanking<00:02:57.599> them<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:58.079> you're<00:02:58.260> gonna<00:02:58.349> mess<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.650> up

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
yanking them off you're gonna mess it up

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.559 
yanking them off you're gonna mess it up
and<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.069> could<00:02:59.189> possibly<00:02:59.639> remove<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.299> hair

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569

and you could possibly remove the hair
so<00:03:01.230> depending<00:03:02.189> on<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.459> size<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.970> eyes<00:03:03.120> are
