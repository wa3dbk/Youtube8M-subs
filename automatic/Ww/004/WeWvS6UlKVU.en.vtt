00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
extracted files this is a bit file here

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.740 
extracted files this is a bit file here
this<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.160> CSV<00:03:53.550> file<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.820> this<00:03:54.210> is<00:03:54.390> our<00:03:54.540> in

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
this is a CSV file and this is our in

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.860 
this is a CSV file and this is our in
tool<00:03:54.960> will<00:03:55.620> use<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.070> here<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.970> once<00:03:57.270> all<00:03:57.630> these

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
tool will use it here so once all these

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.150 
tool will use it here so once all these
files<00:03:58.110> are<00:03:59.000> extracted<00:04:00.000> open<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.050> odin<00:04:01.890> file

files are extracted open the odin file

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.120 
files are extracted open the odin file
so<00:04:03.000> orang<00:04:03.330> file<00:04:03.690> will<00:04:03.960> be<00:04:03.990> looking<00:04:04.470> like<00:04:04.500> this

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
so orang file will be looking like this

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.480 
so orang file will be looking like this
so<00:04:05.730> odin<00:04:06.630> version<00:04:06.990> 1.7<00:04:07.590> 0<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.160> look<00:04:08.310> it
