00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
that log so I think finding some cover

that log so I think finding some cover
their<00:00:56.839> spawn<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.649> get<00:00:57.769> ready<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:57.979> spawn

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190

there between the spring and the hook

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.280 
there between the spring and the hook
point<00:01:43.119> which<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.510> what<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.810> need<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.110> have<00:01:44.229> a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so well I like going a little bit

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.610 
so well I like going a little bit
heavier<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.570> make<00:02:25.720> more<00:02:25.900> contact<00:02:26.470> with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
heavier you can make more contact with

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.750 
heavier you can make more contact with
the<00:02:26.709> bottom<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.040> feel<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.400> generate<00:02:27.730> a

the tip of it off is I don't know why
you<00:03:59.349> would<00:03:59.560> take<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.769> brand<00:04:00.159> new<00:04:00.280> worm<00:04:00.459> out<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.669> a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
you would take a brand new worm out of a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.059 
you would take a brand new worm out of a
bag<00:04:00.939> and<00:04:01.180> then<00:04:01.629> have<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.959> break<00:04:02.590> off<00:04:02.769> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
bag and then have to break off the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.190 
bag and then have to break off the
portion<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.909> just<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.180> rig<00:04:04.359> it<00:04:04.510> never<00:04:05.019> made

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
portion of it just to rig it never made

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.020 
portion of it just to rig it never made
sense<00:04:05.409> to<00:04:05.530> me<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:05.950> we<00:04:06.069> designed<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.819> way

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
sense to me so we designed it this way

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.360 
sense to me so we designed it this way
and<00:04:07.299> then<00:04:07.780> also<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.620> portion<00:04:08.980> where<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.219> hook

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
and then also the portion where the hook

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.009 
and then also the portion where the hook
comes<00:04:09.639> through<00:04:09.909> if<00:04:10.209> you're<00:04:10.510> going<00:04:10.629> to<00:04:10.689> Texas

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
comes through if you're going to Texas

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.050 
comes through if you're going to Texas
rig<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.319> or<00:04:11.439> put<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.769> shaky<00:04:12.159> head<00:04:12.340> the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
rig it or put it on a shaky head the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.399 
rig it or put it on a shaky head the
part<00:04:13.510> where<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.719> hook<00:04:13.870> comes<00:04:14.109> through<00:04:14.290> is

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
part where the hook comes through is

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.289 
part where the hook comes through is
thinner<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:14.859> you<00:04:14.889> can<00:04:15.099> see<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.400> thinner<00:04:15.699> so

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
thinner as you can see is thinner so

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.170 
thinner as you can see is thinner so
that<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.539> hook<00:04:16.750> ups<00:04:16.959> are<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.199> lot<00:04:17.560> better<00:04:17.799> than

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
that the hook ups are a lot better than

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.089 
that the hook ups are a lot better than
when<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.299> have<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.509> thicker<00:04:20.410> portion<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:20.949> never

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
when you have a thicker portion it never

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.379 
when you have a thicker portion it never
made<00:04:21.280> sense<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.579> me<00:04:21.699> why<00:04:21.849> the<00:04:21.910> thickest

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
made sense to me why the thickest

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.240 
made sense to me why the thickest
portion<00:04:22.599> was<00:04:23.320> where<00:04:23.500> your<00:04:23.590> hook<00:04:23.770> went<00:04:24.009> through

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
portion was where your hook went through

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.249 
portion was where your hook went through
we<00:04:24.880> fixed<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.270> we<00:04:25.449> made<00:04:25.599> it<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> thinnest

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
we fixed that we made it the thinnest

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.040 
we fixed that we made it the thinnest
portion<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:26.889> there's<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.699> Missal<00:04:28.030> baits<00:04:28.240> fuse

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
portion so there's the Missal baits fuse

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.560 
portion so there's the Missal baits fuse
four<00:04:29.830> point<00:04:30.130> four<00:04:30.400> we<00:04:30.789> got<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> bunch<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.330> cool
