00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
make it work you could always just go to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.060

this<00:00:54.590> on<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:56.090> Play<00:00:56.480> Store<00:00:56.750> but<00:00:57.079> Sony<00:00:57.770> tries<00:00:57.980> to

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
this on the Play Store but Sony tries to

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.830 
this on the Play Store but Sony tries to
make<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.220> very<00:00:58.430> easy<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:59.450> by<00:00:59.720> using<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.040> app

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
make it very easy just by using the app

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.469 
make it very easy just by using the app
through<00:01:02.840> NFC<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.649> then<00:01:03.860> downloading<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.579> so

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
through NFC and then downloading it so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.120 
through NFC and then downloading it so
now<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:05.689> see<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:05.930> app<00:01:06.170> downloading<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:06.950> once

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
now we see the app downloading and once

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.610 
now we see the app downloading and once
it's<00:01:07.520> done<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.479> will<00:01:08.900> be<00:01:09.020> able<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.260> connect<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's done we will be able to connect to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.190 
it's done we will be able to connect to
it<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.510> can<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:11.720> an<00:01:11.780> idea<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.110> how

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
it and just so we can get an idea of how

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.180 
it and just so we can get an idea of how
it<00:01:12.380> looks

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880 

that's<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:16.340> excellent<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.740> once<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
that's just excellent so once it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.410 
that's just excellent so once it
downloads<00:01:19.010> you<00:01:19.369> should<00:01:19.549> be<00:01:19.670> able<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:20.000> use<00:01:20.180> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
downloads you should be able to use it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.310 
downloads you should be able to use it
to<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.200> watch<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:23.030> course<00:01:23.510> then<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.049> can

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
to the watch and of course then we can

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.990 
to the watch and of course then we can
have<00:01:24.560> access<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.100> all<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.369> apps<00:01:25.549> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and now it's going to install and then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.740 
and now it's going to install and then
we'll<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.610> able<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.909> open<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.740> now<00:01:52.750> connect

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
we'll be able to open it and now connect

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.640 
we'll be able to open it and now connect
to<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.840> see<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.380> connect

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
to it so as you can see this to connect

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.020 
to it so as you can see this to connect
devices<00:01:57.770> or<00:01:58.460> for<00:01:58.990> events<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:01.100> now<00:02:01.579> we're<00:02:01.880> just

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
devices or for events so now we're just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:15.230 
devices or for events so now we're just
going<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.630> connect<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.759> device

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.410 

and<00:02:15.900> we're<00:02:16.080> trying<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> scan<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.190> then<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and we're trying to scan for it then you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.310 
and we're trying to scan for it then you
can<00:02:18.600> find<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.170> watch<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:24.270> now<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.930> pairing

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
can find the watch and now it's pairing

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.050 
can find the watch and now it's pairing
to<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.800> now<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.070> paired<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:26.880> see<00:02:27.030> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
to it and now it's paired and we see a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.860 
to it and now it's paired and we see a
little<00:02:27.300> check<00:02:27.480> mark<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:29.870> install

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
little check mark on there install

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.290 
little check mark on there install
required<00:02:31.020> on<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.410> application<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
required on the application and there we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.560 
required on the application and there we
go<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.580> how<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.790> connect<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.300> Sony
