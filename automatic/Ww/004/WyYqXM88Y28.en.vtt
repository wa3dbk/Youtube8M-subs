minutes<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.710> begin<00:01:17.890> all<00:01:18.159> might<00:01:18.369> take<00:01:18.549> a

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
minutes if you begin all might take a

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.149 
minutes if you begin all might take a
bit<00:01:18.640> more<00:01:20.819> ok<00:01:21.819> i<00:01:22.560> only<00:01:23.560> started<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.009> white

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
bit more ok i only started for the white

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.800 
bit more ok i only started for the white
side<00:01:24.399> because<00:01:24.789> i<00:01:24.909> like<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.479> stood

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
side because i like it and you stood

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.789 
side because i like it and you stood
outside<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:28.780> you'd<00:01:29.020> have<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.380> get<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
outside so first you'd have to get a

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
outside so first you'd have to get a
white<00:01:30.549> side<00:01:30.850> white<00:01:31.390> piece<00:01:31.630> with<00:01:32.409> pebble<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.189> it
