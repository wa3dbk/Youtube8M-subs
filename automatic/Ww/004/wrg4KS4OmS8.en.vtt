you<00:02:08.610> won't<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.569> costs<00:02:10.140> lots<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you won't see your costs lots of

movement<00:02:11.130> because<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> game<00:02:12.390> runs

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
movement because of this game runs

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170 
movement because of this game runs
pretty<00:02:13.050> well<00:02:13.230> even<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.739> my<00:02:13.890> laptop<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.820> an

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
pretty well even on my laptop it's an

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.810 
pretty well even on my laptop it's an
unreal<00:02:15.690> engine<00:02:16.170> free<00:02:16.440> after<00:02:16.769> all<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.459> guess

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
unreal engine free after all so I guess

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.080 
unreal engine free after all so I guess
you<00:02:18.030> should<00:02:18.209> know<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.989> expect<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.670> then

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you should know what to expect but then

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.440 
you should know what to expect but then
after<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.080> got<00:02:22.560> amazed<00:02:23.010> by<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> graphics<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.030> got

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
after I got amazed by the graphics I got

adventure game veteran quite short but
as<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.650> whole<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.820> very<00:03:37.150> very<00:03:37.660> nice<00:03:37.990> indeed

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
as a whole it's a very very nice indeed

this<00:03:41.530> kind<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.070> games<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.820> often<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:44.020> only

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
this kind of games very often the only

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.010 
this kind of games very often the only
silly<00:03:44.740> problem<00:03:45.370> was<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> save<00:03:46.000> game<00:03:46.270> system

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
silly problem was the save game system

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.860 
silly problem was the save game system
which<00:03:47.260> was<00:03:47.470> based<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:48.190> out<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.880> saves<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.750> I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
which was based on out of saves and I

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.500 
which was based on out of saves and I
sometimes<00:03:50.470> got<00:03:51.100> angry<00:03:51.760> because<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.360> never

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
sometimes got angry because you never

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.230 
sometimes got angry because you never
knows<00:03:52.990> when<00:03:53.740> the<00:03:54.040> game<00:03:54.340> will<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:55.000> which

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
knows when the game will do it which

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.510 
knows when the game will do it which
fortunately<00:03:55.930> didn't<00:03:56.560> happen<00:03:56.950> very<00:03:56.980> often

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
fortunately didn't happen very often

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.660 
fortunately didn't happen very often
because<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.300> was<00:03:58.480> sticked<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.320> end<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.520> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
because I was sticked to the end and I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.600 
because I was sticked to the end and I
guess<00:04:00.910> that's<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.960> final<00:04:02.530> recommendation<00:04:03.460> I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
guess that's the final recommendation I

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.210 
guess that's the final recommendation I
guess<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.390> safe<00:04:04.750> system<00:04:05.440> can<00:04:05.680> still<00:04:06.040> be

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
guess the safe system can still be

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.300 
guess the safe system can still be
patched<00:04:06.550> but<00:04:06.880> even<00:04:07.630> left<00:04:08.020> like<00:04:08.350> this<00:04:08.650> now

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
patched but even left like this now

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.700 
patched but even left like this now
I<00:04:09.340> enjoyed<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.450> vanishing<00:04:10.990> of<00:04:11.110> Ethan<00:04:11.470> Carter
