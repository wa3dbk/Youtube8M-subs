00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello my name is ivan tea on 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 today comparing two bikes live and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 against mangus this i traveled already 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.330
 few months and he will be presented 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.760
 girl and I bought such a little animal 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 this is a semi-professional model this 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 amateur frame here more here 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 goal is just excel wheels the same 26 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 inches the difference immediately go over the skirt that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.370
 at a distance here is 100 millimeters weight 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.379
 63 smoother running this tough very 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.289
 practically do not crank also here 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 there is a lock that's it 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.899
 useful on flat roads or 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.899
 when climbing uphill 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.000
 the brakes are the same disc on 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.129
 shorts not hydraulically 160 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.799
 millimeters 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:13.619
 absolutely identical switches are 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.850
 amateur level too 24 speeds on 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 My indication here is more comfortable 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.470
 it is necessary to look ahead all as 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 by your eyes 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 this bike is easier somewhere I do not know 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.299
 8-12 pounds is 20 years here 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.979
 steel frame and here aluminum 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.979
 technology terms ruffled tangle 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.200
 still there speed metal color enriched 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 metal 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.570
 this is the trademark sign of gee ti he 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 accelerates much faster I think that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 it is connected that the highway is bicycles 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.560
 much better built that is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.600
 the location of the rider who wants and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 may not even pedal here and sat down and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.159
 drove this constantly twist pass 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.879
 I also experienced this wow effect until 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:23.599
 valentine bikes 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:23.599
 live twenty thousand rubles trial sport 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:32.400
 but the difference between them is huge and sidushka 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.709
 up in professional models at all 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.260
 sidushka very hard troops one if 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.959
 from bamboo and therefore need to use 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.239
 how does he have a silicone case or 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.910
 special clothes choked to see 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 bright titushko wings are not supplied 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.030
 bundled there are bikes even more 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.569
 high level even without pedals 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.780
 I think it is even cruel to 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.220
 the steering wheel is very wide compared to this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.019
 such a grip well, and the principle of steve wickets 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.579
 driving through 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.730
 departure somehow by harder began to go a 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.709
 so normally it is easier that you can 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.709
 carry 6 tanks 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.530
 spread our wings at the police gate gran 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.530
 turismo bye
