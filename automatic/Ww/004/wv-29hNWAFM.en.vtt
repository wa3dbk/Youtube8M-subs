00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.060 
while I'm pushing it down the things
going<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> go<00:03:29.800> in<00:03:29.950> at<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.130> same<00:03:30.220> time<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:32.070> see

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
going to go in at the same time so see

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.760 
going to go in at the same time so see
there<00:03:33.310> it's<00:03:33.610> already<00:03:33.940> gained<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:35.050> I'm<00:03:35.380> just<00:03:35.620> go

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
there it's already gained so I'm just go

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.160 
there it's already gained so I'm just go
push<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.790> then<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.989> is

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
push it in like that and then this is

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.580 
push it in like that and then this is
out<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.600> plug<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:40.959> inside<00:03:41.350> already

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
out and then the plug is inside already

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.530 
out and then the plug is inside already
so<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.330> going<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.570> go<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.930> like<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
so this is going to go in like that so

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.860 
so this is going to go in like that so
the<00:03:49.780> thing<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.080> do<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:51.390> when<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.690> your

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
the thing you do is when you have your

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.910 
the thing you do is when you have your
taper<00:03:55.739> while<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.100> your<00:03:57.250> ear<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:58.060> get<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
taper while it's in your ear you get it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.190 
taper while it's in your ear you get it
just<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.209> push<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.930> then

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
just like that then you push it then

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.410 
just like that then you push it then
you'll<00:04:02.470> slip<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.850> now<00:04:04.000> I'm<00:04:04.060> going<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.300> the
