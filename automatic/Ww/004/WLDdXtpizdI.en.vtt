okay<00:00:28.829> so<00:00:29.460> far<00:00:29.730> we've<00:00:29.939> covered<00:00:30.149> the<00:00:30.300> basic

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
okay so far we've covered the basic

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
okay so far we've covered the basic
construction<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.410> cards<00:00:31.860> from<00:00:32.099> triads<00:00:32.759> right

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
construction of cards from triads right

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
construction of cards from triads right
through<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> 13th<00:00:34.230> extensions<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:35.040> by

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
through to the 13th extensions or by

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.669 
through to the 13th extensions or by
stacking<00:00:35.790> thirds<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.440> several

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
stacking thirds but there are several

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.709 
stacking thirds but there are several
chords<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.340> you'll<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.699> quite<00:00:39.030> often<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
chords that you'll see quite often the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.259 
chords that you'll see quite often the
answer<00:00:39.929> consequence<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.859> this<00:00:41.010> stacking<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
answer consequence of this stacking the

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.299 
answer consequence of this stacking the
first<00:00:42.570> group<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.140> what's<00:00:43.410> known<00:00:43.679> as<00:00:43.829> added

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
first group are what's known as added

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.060 
first group are what's known as added
note<00:00:44.519> cards<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.379> pods<00:00:46.620> where

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
note cards now these are pods where

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.189 
note cards now these are pods where
extensions<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.969> added<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> basic<00:00:48.600> triad

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
extensions are added to the basic triad

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.009 
extensions are added to the basic triad
without<00:00:49.829> including<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.489> seventh<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.899> we

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
without including the seventh so as we

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.560 
without including the seventh so as we
saw<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> lesson<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.949> extensions<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.329> 9th

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
saw in the lesson on extensions the 9th

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.899 
saw in the lesson on extensions the 9th
11th<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.289> 13th<00:00:55.469> chords<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.429> all<00:00:56.640> built<00:00:56.850> from

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
11th and 13th chords are all built from

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.209 
11th and 13th chords are all built from
a<00:00:57.120> seventh<00:00:57.480> chord<00:00:57.690> foundation<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.620> require

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a seventh chord foundation and require

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.060 
a seventh chord foundation and require
the<00:00:59.399> inclusion<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.329> 7th<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.530> example<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the inclusion of a 7th so for example a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.430 
the inclusion of a 7th so for example a
C<00:01:02.309> major<00:01:02.579> nine<00:01:02.969> chord<00:01:02.999> would<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.929> built<00:01:04.290> from

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
C major nine chord would be built from

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.499 
C major nine chord would be built from
the<00:01:04.589> notes<00:01:04.800> C<00:01:05.460> E<00:01:05.730> G<00:01:06.570> B<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:07.650> D<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> D<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
the notes C E G B and D the D is the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.710 
the notes C E G B and D the D is the
ninth<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.439> beans<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.979> seventh<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.579> C<00:01:12.509> ad

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
ninth and the beans the seventh a C ad

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.530 
ninth and the beans the seventh a C ad
nine<00:01:13.140> chord<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.880> seventh

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
nine chord would not need that seventh

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.819 
nine chord would not need that seventh
so<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.170> C<00:01:16.649> e<00:01:16.950> G<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> D<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.680> we're

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
so we would have C e G and D so we're

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.880 
so we would have C e G and D so we're
missing<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> 7th<00:01:20.610> fare<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> let's<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.710> at

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
missing the 7th fare so let's look at

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
missing the 7th fare so let's look at
the<00:01:23.040> construction<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> common<00:01:24.570> added

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the construction of all the common added

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
the construction of all the common added
note<00:01:25.170> chords<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.369> three<00:01:26.579> men<00:01:26.759> types

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
note chords there are three men types

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.410 
note chords there are three men types
the<00:01:27.450> 6<00:01:27.869> quart<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.560> ad<00:01:28.710> 9<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.579> 6<00:01:29.820> 9<00:01:30.090> and

the 6 quart the ad 9 and the 6 9 and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
the 6 quart the ad 9 and the 6 9 and
there's<00:01:30.990> also<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.259> minor<00:01:31.590> version<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.189> each<00:01:32.310> one

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
there's also a minor version of each one

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.209 
there's also a minor version of each one
given<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> -6<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.079> minor<00:01:34.350> add<00:01:34.590> 9<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
given as the -6 the minor add 9 and the

as<00:01:36.780> always<00:01:37.409> we'll<00:01:37.829> look<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> chords<00:01:38.460> from

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
as always we'll look at the chords from

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
as always we'll look at the chords from
a<00:01:38.700> root<00:01:38.850> note<00:01:39.060> C<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.960> we'll<00:01:40.229> take<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.979> at

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
a root note C which we'll take here at

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
a root note C which we'll take here at
the<00:01:41.219> 8th<00:01:41.460> 3rd<00:01:41.789> fret<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.270> E<00:01:42.420> string<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the 8th 3rd fret of the E string and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
the 8th 3rd fret of the E string and
remember<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> tab<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> sheet<00:01:45.539> music

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
remember that the tab and sheet music

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
remember that the tab and sheet music
are<00:01:46.079> all<00:01:46.259> available<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.340> these

are all available for all of these

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
are all available for all of these
arpeggios<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> be

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
arpeggios so that's that can be

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
first we have the C 6 chord now this is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.679 
first we have the C 6 chord now this is
a<00:01:55.740> major<00:01:56.009> triad<00:01:56.509> c<00:01:57.509> e<00:01:57.780> g<00:01:58.579> with<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.880> major<00:02:00.299> sixth

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
a major triad c e g with the major sixth

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.100 
a major triad c e g with the major sixth
added<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.479> c<00:02:03.719> e<00:02:03.990> g

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
added the a there so we have c e g

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.920 
added the a there so we have c e g
and<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:05.950> include<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.190> octave<00:02:06.670> there<00:02:07.360> we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
and if we include the octave there we

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.150 
and if we include the octave there we
get<00:02:11.250> okay<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.460> we've<00:02:13.060> got<00:02:13.090> one<00:02:13.660> three<00:02:14.230> five<00:02:14.680> six

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
get okay so we've got one three five six

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.710 
get okay so we've got one three five six
and<00:02:15.700> again<00:02:15.910> remember<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.330> there's<00:02:16.600> no

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and again remember that there's no

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.070 
and again remember that there's no
seventh<00:02:17.110> added<00:02:19.590> okay<00:02:21.090> next<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> C<00:02:22.870> at

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
seventh added okay next we have the C at

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.320 
seventh added okay next we have the C at
nine<00:02:23.410> chord<00:02:23.740> now<00:02:24.130> as<00:02:24.310> shown<00:02:24.520> before<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.300> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
nine chord now as shown before this is a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.950 
nine chord now as shown before this is a
major<00:02:25.630> major<00:02:26.440> triad<00:02:26.920> ceg<00:02:27.760> with<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> major<00:02:28.600> ninth

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
major major triad ceg with a major ninth

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.060 
major major triad ceg with a major ninth
added<00:02:29.380> in<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:29.950> case<00:02:30.190> D<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.270> have<00:02:31.450> c<00:02:31.750> e<00:02:31.990> g<00:02:32.080> d

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
added in this case D so we have c e g d

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.520 
added in this case D so we have c e g d
and<00:02:33.820> because<00:02:34.180> there's<00:02:34.390> no<00:02:34.510> seventh<00:02:34.990> will<00:02:35.320> play

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and because there's no seventh will play

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.500 
and because there's no seventh will play
the<00:02:35.710> ninth<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> second<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.120> same<00:02:37.300> octave

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the ninth as a second in the same octave

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
the ninth as a second in the same octave
as<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.990> root<00:02:38.200> note<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.250> have<00:02:39.460> C<00:02:39.910> D<00:02:40.450> G<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
as the root note so we have C D G and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.330 
as the root note so we have C D G and
the<00:02:42.520> octave<00:02:42.820> C<00:02:45.330> okay<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.590> ad<00:02:47.709> nine<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the octave C okay the ad nine is a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.570 
the octave C okay the ad nine is a
pretty<00:02:48.760> nice<00:02:49.420> sounding<00:02:50.140> chord<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.400> can

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
pretty nice sounding chord and you can

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.490 
pretty nice sounding chord and you can
use<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.060> kind<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.330> effect<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
use it for that kind of effect the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.320 
use it for that kind of effect the

to<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> good<00:02:56.290> example<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.800> an<00:02:56.950> AB<00:02:57.070> 9

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
to you is a good example of an AB 9

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000 
to you is a good example of an AB 9
chord<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.540> there's<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.780> two<00:02:59.050> octave<00:02:59.230> arpeggio

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
chord and there's a two octave arpeggio

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.940 
chord and there's a two octave arpeggio
you<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.850> really<00:03:01.030> hear<00:03:01.360> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.270 

so<00:03:05.950> nice<00:03:06.990> next<00:03:07.990> up<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.770> six<00:03:09.040> nine

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
so nice next up we have the six nine

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.370 
so nice next up we have the six nine
chord<00:03:09.670> now<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> combination<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
chord now this is a combination of the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.590 
chord now this is a combination of the
six<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.890> add<00:03:12.280> nine<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.820> that<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.150> add<00:03:13.360> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
six and the add nine in that we add the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.720 
six and the add nine in that we add the
sixth<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.140> ninth<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.769> second<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
sixth and the ninth of a second to the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.720 
sixth and the ninth of a second to the
basic<00:03:16.060> triad<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.170> C<00:03:17.440> we<00:03:17.769> have<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> notes<00:03:18.220> C

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
basic triad so in C we have the notes C

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.430 
basic triad so in C we have the notes C
D<00:03:19.450> E<00:03:19.830> G<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.269> which<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.720> might<00:03:22.900> also<00:03:22.959> recognize

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
D E G a which you might also recognize

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.710 
D E G a which you might also recognize
as<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.730> same<00:03:24.910> pattern<00:03:25.239> as<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.390> major

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
as the same pattern as a major

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.750 
as the same pattern as a major
pentatonic<00:03:26.140> scale<00:03:29.310> we've<00:03:30.310> got<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.489> basic

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
pentatonic scale we've got the basic

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.350 
pentatonic scale we've got the basic
triad<00:03:31.150> ceg<00:03:32.370> at<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.580> 9th<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.209> second<00:03:34.780> d<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
triad ceg at the 9th of a second d and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.750 
triad ceg at the 9th of a second d and
the<00:03:38.140> 6th<00:03:38.500> EA

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.660 

okay<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.799> will<00:03:42.799> quickly<00:03:43.010> run<00:03:43.310> through<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
okay I will quickly run through the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.789 
okay I will quickly run through the
minor<00:03:43.879> versions<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.540> these<00:03:44.689> chords<00:03:45.140> they're

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
minor versions of these chords they're

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.619 
minor versions of these chords they're
exactly<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.370> same<00:03:46.610> but<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.909> best<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.299> minor

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
exactly the same but the best on a minor

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.280 
exactly the same but the best on a minor
triad

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
triad

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.069 
triad
so<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.620> third<00:03:48.829> is<00:03:49.040> flattened<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.450> sixth<00:03:50.930> and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
so the third is flattened the sixth and

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.630 
so the third is flattened the sixth and
the<00:03:51.110> ninth<00:03:51.409> though<00:03:51.739> they're<00:03:52.040> still<00:03:52.220> major

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
the ninth though they're still major

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.720 
the ninth though they're still major
intervals<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:54.019> in<00:03:54.170> C<00:03:54.470> we'll<00:03:54.829> be<00:03:54.950> using<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.250> D<00:03:55.430> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
intervals so in C we'll be using a D and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.080 
intervals so in C we'll be using a D and
an<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.939> not<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.599> D<00:03:56.810> flat<00:03:57.079> or<00:03:57.260> an<00:03:57.349> a-flat<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.849> C

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
an a not a D flat or an a-flat so a C

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.660 
an a not a D flat or an a-flat so a C
minor<00:03:59.360> six<00:03:59.720> chord<00:03:59.989> contains<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.650> notes<00:04:00.860> C<00:04:01.400> E

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
minor six chord contains the notes C E

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.319 
minor six chord contains the notes C E
flat<00:04:02.060> G<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> minor<00:04:03.860> triad<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:05.030> then<00:04:05.180> the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
flat G just the minor triad and then the

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.809 
flat G just the minor triad and then the
a<00:04:05.360> so<00:04:06.049> that's<00:04:06.230> one<00:04:06.769> flat<00:04:07.459> three<00:04:07.790> five<00:04:08.299> six

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
a so that's one flat three five six

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.590 
a so that's one flat three five six
so<00:04:10.819> C<00:04:11.150> minus<00:04:11.329> six<00:04:11.659> chord<00:04:14.140> okay<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.729> C<00:04:16.729> minor<00:04:17.030> at<00:04:17.329> 9

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
so C minus six chord okay a C minor at 9

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.400 
so C minus six chord okay a C minor at 9
contains<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.560> notes<00:04:18.739> C<00:04:19.669> D<00:04:20.329> eath<00:04:20.989> 1<00:04:21.350> G<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.130> then

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
contains the notes C D eath 1 G and then

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.909 
contains the notes C D eath 1 G and then
that's<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.530> C<00:04:24.710> minor<00:04:24.949> try<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.400> again<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:27.590> then

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
that's the C minor try it again and then

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.920 
that's the C minor try it again and then
we<00:04:28.010> just<00:04:28.160> add<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.490> 9th<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.030> second<00:04:29.419> so

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
we just add the 9th of a second so

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.200 
we just add the 9th of a second so
that's<00:04:30.050> 1<00:04:30.440> 2<00:04:30.789> flat<00:04:31.789> 3<00:04:31.820> 5<00:04:35.860> ok

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
that's 1 2 flat 3 5 ok

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.390 
that's 1 2 flat 3 5 ok
finally<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.389> C<00:04:38.750> minor<00:04:39.050> 6<00:04:39.440> 9<00:04:39.650> concerns<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.340> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
finally the C minor 6 9 concerns of the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.250 
finally the C minor 6 9 concerns of the
notes<00:04:40.580> C<00:04:41.300> D<00:04:42.080> E<00:04:42.410> flat<00:04:42.710> G<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:44.990> we<00:04:45.080> want<00:04:45.199> to

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
notes C D E flat G a and then we want to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.700 
notes C D E flat G a and then we want to
see<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:46.370> I've<00:04:46.430> got<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.639> minor<00:04:46.849> triad<00:04:47.150> again

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
see so I've got the minor triad again

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.850 
see so I've got the minor triad again
with<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.860> second<00:04:49.340> added<00:04:49.580> on<00:04:49.699> 9th<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.500> 6th

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
with the second added on 9th and the 6th

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:02.950 
with the second added on 9th and the 6th
so<00:04:52.580> we've<00:04:52.699> got<00:04:52.849> 1<00:04:53.240> 2<00:04:53.840> 1<00:04:54.530> 3<00:04:54.560> 5<00:04:55.370> 6<00:04:59.500> C<00:05:00.500> -<00:05:00.830> 16<00:05:01.539> as<00:05:02.539> with

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
so we've got 1 2 1 3 5 6 C - 16 as with

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.870 
so we've got 1 2 1 3 5 6 C - 16 as with
the<00:05:02.990> other<00:05:03.110> chord<00:05:03.470> lessons<00:05:03.889> we<00:05:04.190> can<00:05:04.400> play<00:05:04.849> a

practice drill through these chords in

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.210 
practice drill through these chords in
order<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.250> we'll<00:05:07.430> use<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.729> sequence<00:05:08.150> 6<00:05:08.660> ad<00:05:08.930> 9<00:05:09.590> 6

some people have different ways of

notating<00:06:37.580> the<00:06:37.700> same<00:06:37.910> card<00:06:38.210> and<00:06:38.510> add<00:06:39.230> 11<00:06:39.710> cod

notating the same card and add 11 cod
would<00:06:40.550> be<00:06:40.760> a<00:06:40.790> triad<00:06:41.330> with<00:06:41.510> an<00:06:41.630> added<00:06:41.900> 11th<00:06:42.320> now

would be a triad with an added 11th now
this<00:06:43.070> is<00:06:43.220> much<00:06:43.640> rare<00:06:43.940> record<00:06:44.330> because<00:06:44.600> of<00:06:44.630> the

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
this is much rare record because of the

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.390 
this is much rare record because of the
clash<00:06:45.020> between<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.650> major<00:06:45.830> third<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.220> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
clash between the major third and the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.550 
clash between the major third and the
perfect<00:06:46.610> fourth<00:06:47.030> so<00:06:47.660> you're<00:06:47.960> more<00:06:48.080> likely<00:06:48.140> to

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
perfect fourth so you're more likely to

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.520 
perfect fourth so you're more likely to
see<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:48.980> minor<00:06:49.250> add<00:06:49.550> 11<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.930> main<00:06:51.170> point<00:06:51.470> to

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
see a minor add 11 the main point to

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.200 
see a minor add 11 the main point to
take<00:06:51.740> from<00:06:51.800> all<00:06:52.100> of<00:06:52.220> this<00:06:52.370> is<00:06:52.580> that<00:06:52.910> the<00:06:53.000> word

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
take from all of this is that the word

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.570 
take from all of this is that the word
add<00:06:53.360> can<00:06:53.900> be<00:06:54.020> taken<00:06:54.470> to<00:06:54.500> simply<00:06:55.010> mean<00:06:55.160> that<00:06:55.400> you

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
add can be taken to simply mean that you

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.450 
add can be taken to simply mean that you
add<00:06:55.790> whatever<00:06:56.300> scale<00:06:56.750> degree<00:06:57.140> specified<00:06:57.770> but

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
add whatever scale degree specified but

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.910 
add whatever scale degree specified but
in<00:06:58.580> terms<00:06:58.820> of<00:06:58.940> regular<00:06:59.330> usage<00:06:59.570> the<00:07:00.140> six<00:07:00.500> six

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920 
in terms of regular usage the six six

in terms of regular usage the six six
nine<00:07:01.010> and<00:07:01.400> add<00:07:01.580> nine<00:07:01.820> are<00:07:02.120> definitely<00:07:02.570> the

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
nine and add nine are definitely the

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.710 
nine and add nine are definitely the
cords<00:07:03.350> to<00:07:03.410> practice<00:07:04.120> okay<00:07:05.120> so<00:07:05.180> try<00:07:05.420> these

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
cords to practice okay so try these

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.480 
cords to practice okay so try these
