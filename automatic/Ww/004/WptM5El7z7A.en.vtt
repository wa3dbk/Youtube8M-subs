at all possible

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.080 
at all possible
it's<00:01:03.510> nice<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.589> add<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:05.010> additional<00:01:05.159> shutoff

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's nice to add an additional shutoff

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
it's nice to add an additional shutoff
here<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.810> own<00:01:06.960> water<00:01:07.260> supply<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
here for your own water supply so you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
here for your own water supply so you
don't<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.729> keep<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.150> underneath<00:01:09.600> the

troubleshooting steps will kind of go

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
troubleshooting steps will kind of go
through<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.650> I'll<00:01:25.830> try<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> show

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
through these just and I'll try to show

through these just and I'll try to show
you<00:01:27.049> what<00:01:28.049> components<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> check<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> RO

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you what components to check on the RO

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
you what components to check on the RO
versus<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> problems<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> might<00:01:31.470> run

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
versus the problems that you might run

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.149 
versus the problems that you might run
into<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> field<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.979> listed

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
into in the field the first one listed

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.510 
into in the field the first one listed
here<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> high<00:01:36.090> product<00:01:36.479> water<00:01:36.869> TDS<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
here is a high product water TDS the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
here is a high product water TDS the
first<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.590> your

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
first thing to really do is with your

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.969 
first thing to really do is with your
TDS<00:01:41.250> meter<00:01:41.869> check<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.049> old<00:01:43.229> water<00:01:43.470> supply

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:02:02.070 

and<00:01:50.270> here<00:01:51.270> our<00:01:51.450> RO<00:01:51.810> water<00:01:52.020> supply<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.700> 310

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.960 

with<00:02:03.080> our<00:02:03.350> ro<00:02:04.310> spigot<00:02:05.060> our<00:02:05.270> TDS<00:02:06.230> reading<00:02:06.650> is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
with our ro spigot our TDS reading is

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.190 
with our ro spigot our TDS reading is
299<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:10.040> our<00:02:10.190> product<00:02:10.700> water<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.300> our<00:02:11.660> water

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
299 so our product water and our water

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.890 
299 so our product water and our water
are<00:02:13.450> almost<00:02:14.590> identical<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.770> TDs<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:17.630> first

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
are almost identical in TDs the first

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.830 
are almost identical in TDs the first
thing<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.440> want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> look<00:02:18.860> at<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
thing that we want to look at is the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.630 
thing that we want to look at is the
membrane<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.470> membrane<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:22.070> what<00:02:22.280> actually

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
membrane the membrane is what actually

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.260 
membrane the membrane is what actually
reduces<00:02:23.450> all<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> TDs<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:25.100> your<00:02:25.400> membrane<00:02:25.940> is

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
reduces all the TDs if your membrane is

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.300 
reduces all the TDs if your membrane is
at<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> end<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.870> its<00:02:27.020> life<00:02:27.260> cycle<00:02:27.310> it's

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
at the end of its life cycle it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.220 
at the end of its life cycle it's
probably<00:02:28.790> exhausted<00:02:29.030> or<00:02:29.480> fouled<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.050> just

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
probably exhausted or fouled and just
