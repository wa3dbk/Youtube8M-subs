00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.269
 but to his law-abiding citizens 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.820
 queue need to remember exactly when 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.740
 them the same water meter appeared in 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.200
 that from time to time all similar 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.060
 devices need to be checked for sure 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.740
 know consider exactly here I am a resident brought 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.739
 the meter turned out was a prescription 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.739
 change the counter or believe it 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.569
 Alexander has not made a reservation 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.119
 it is such a term though it will still be 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.070
 check whether the device is lying, the time has come 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.590
 verification is just another 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.260
 and an extraordinary regular calibration or so 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.800
 called planned it is produced for 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.289
 all water meters for hot meter 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 water 4 years after their factory 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.339
 calibration for cold water meters 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.289
 6 years after factory calibration 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.690
 that is, in the manufacture and then like 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.730
 knights at the crossroads that time is more expensive or 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.550
 money to pay less means you need to carry 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.839
 water meter to the metrological service 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.640
 it is natural to dismantle it 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.649
 the master so that the apartment does not remain without 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.120
 because the water can check the device 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.120
 several days turn 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.040
 and which way can be wrong 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 counter counter may be wrong in favor 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
 consumers benefit supplier but we you 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
 in any case if it exceeds 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 margin of error as 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.050
 rule counters are wrong all the same not in 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.450
 consumer favor here are the numbers 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.730
 someone's home appliance seems to have missed 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.550
 through itself more water than the reference 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.710
 money in the pipe can be calibrated 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.780
 counters right at home the staff will come 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.820
 with special equipment in general how to understand 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770
 Do you need verification or not in Moscow 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.260
 water meters were massively installed in 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.660
 2008 is now just four years passed 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.680
 those who bought themselves need to look in 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.440
 Passport products 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.820
 although who keeps them in this case 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.250
 build on the act of entering into 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.729
 operation if it is not necessary 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.740
 contact the settlement center where this 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.510
 information they can provide 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.080
 turn on hot cold water 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.560
 will appear 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.840
 plan blocked the easiest way 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.910
 put new water meters hostess 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.930
 this apartment and entered it is not necessary 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.739
 take the time to keep track 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.260
 wait for him to believe me very much 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.000
 it was convenient we took the average Moscow 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 prices should be dismantled 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.690
 about 200 rubles 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.920
 checking about 500 set back 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.140
 200 rubles again 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 the device cannot simply be screwed 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.180
 issue commissioning certificate yet 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.980
 500 and that about one and a half thousand rubles 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.739
 about the same in the store costs 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.630
 new water meter and the most offensive if 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.150
 money spent on all this device 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.280
 recognize unfit somewhere on 20 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.620
 percent of the total mass are resting 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 by the way if you look at the testimony of this 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.489
 water meter almost did not work for four 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.580
 of the year just thirty-five cubes came running 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.100
 hot water is very little usually 150 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.790
 200 and still the owner is obliged to hold 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.620
 verification 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.630
 or public utilities with him here is this device 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.239
 with accounting in this case he will pay 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.130
 according to the standard norm he sets 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.170
 for example, some amount of consumption in 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.700
 day no matter man consumed not 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.739
 consumed this amount he will pay 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.570
 It is for this standard if you bet 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.850
 new water meters utility company 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.860
 obliged to give you all the documents on what 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.910
 finished the existence of an old device with 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.740
 what begins but 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.990
 and if it's not just zeros on it 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.060
 Normal red numbers error 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.970
 After all, the meter was tested at the factory. 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.720
 we are for the black and even if only for a 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.390
 water meters 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.370
 no fill there are cracks how is it here 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 in some other mechanical way 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.690
 it is not necessary to carry damaged 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.630
 it's easier to throw out fit for work right away 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.160
 he still does not recognize Alexander
