00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.279 
and I think this is a good video because
it<00:00:27.119> sort<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> shows<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> things<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.260> I

actually genuinely like because in your

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
actually genuinely like because in your
holes<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.410> people<00:00:31.650> buy<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.640> you

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
holes you see what people buy but you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.010 
holes you see what people buy but you
don't<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.149> using<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.870> if

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
don't know if they're using it or not if

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
don't know if they're using it or not if
that<00:00:34.170> makes<00:00:34.350> any<00:00:34.440> sense<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.670> 11<00:00:35.969> things

stuff so the first thing that's random

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.770 
stuff so the first thing that's random
is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.739> bath<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.219> body<00:00:59.370> works<00:00:59.460> pocketbac<00:01:00.300> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is a bath and body works pocketbac or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
is a bath and body works pocketbac or
hand<00:01:00.960> sanitizer<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.579> winter

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
hand sanitizer this one is in winter

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
hand sanitizer this one is in winter
candy<00:01:03.239> apple<00:01:03.660> which<00:01:03.870> came<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.260> i<00:01:04.320> think<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
candy apple which came out i think a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.810 
candy apple which came out i think a
couple<00:01:04.769> years<00:01:05.010> ago<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> i<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> still

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
couple years ago and i think it still

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
couple years ago and i think it still
comes<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.049> bit<00:01:07.170> left

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
comes out just like a little bit left

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.480 
comes out just like a little bit left
but<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.830> hard<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.310> stuff

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
but it's really hard to get that stuff

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
but it's really hard to get that stuff
out<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> smell<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.290> collect

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
out i really like this smell I collect

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
out i really like this smell I collect

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
hand sanitizer so you'll probably see a
