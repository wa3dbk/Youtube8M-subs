we're<00:00:01.920> continuing<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.580> studies<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.149> protein

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
we're continuing our studies of protein

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.510 
we're continuing our studies of protein
function<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.110> Chapter<00:00:04.529> five<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.339> we're

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
function in Chapter five and we're

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.920 
function in Chapter five and we're
continuing<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.089> look<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.390> structural

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
continuing to look at structural

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.049 
continuing to look at structural
proteins<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:08.309> lesson<00:00:08.580> we'll<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:08.910> at

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
proteins in this lesson we'll look at

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.499 
proteins in this lesson we'll look at
tubulin<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.769> microtubules<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.300> some<00:00:12.300> ways

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
tubulin and microtubules in some ways

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.990 
tubulin and microtubules in some ways
the<00:00:13.110> Assembly<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.830> tubulin<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.580> form<00:00:14.880> these

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the Assembly of tubulin to form these

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
the Assembly of tubulin to form these
microtubules<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.990> very<00:00:16.289> similar<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.980> actin

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
microtubules is very similar to actin

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.849 
microtubules is very similar to actin
and<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.359> ways<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.750> different<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and in some ways it's different the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.950 
and in some ways it's different the
first<00:00:20.220> difference<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.330> fundamental<00:00:21.930> unit

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
first difference is the fundamental unit

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.920 
first difference is the fundamental unit
is<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> dimer<00:00:23.100> rather<00:00:23.490> than<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> monomer<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.869> at

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
is a dimer rather than a monomer so at

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
is a dimer rather than a monomer so at
the<00:00:25.050> top<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> screen<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.430> see<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the top of the screen here you see the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
the top of the screen here you see the
two<00:00:27.000> subunits<00:00:27.300> alpha<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> beta<00:00:28.410> tubulin

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
two subunits alpha and beta tubulin

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.880 
two subunits alpha and beta tubulin
that's<00:00:29.640> our<00:00:29.910> dimer<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.539> those<00:00:31.230> dimers<00:00:31.740> will

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that's our dimer and those dimers will

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
that's our dimer and those dimers will
assemble<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> form<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.940> proto<00:00:33.239> filament<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
assemble to form this proto filament and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.350 
assemble to form this proto filament and
there's<00:00:34.469> an<00:00:34.649> asymmetry<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
there's an asymmetry that is out it is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.590 
there's an asymmetry that is out it is
always<00:00:36.719> beta<00:00:36.989> alpha<00:00:37.290> beta<00:00:37.950> alpha<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:39.149> second

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
always beta alpha beta alpha the second

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
always beta alpha beta alpha the second
difference<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> rather<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.309> single

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
difference is that rather than a single

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.209 
difference is that rather than a single
filament<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:43.079> assemble<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> form<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
filament these assemble to form a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
filament these assemble to form a
cylinder<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.850> we'll<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
cylinder and we'll see how in just a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
cylinder and we'll see how in just a
moment<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:47.010> makes<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.760> rigid

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
moment this makes it a very rigid

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.080 
moment this makes it a very rigid
structure<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.410> stronger<00:00:49.890> than<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.640> actin

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
structure much stronger than the actin

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
structure much stronger than the actin
filaments<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.230> important<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:52.980> its

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
filaments and that's important for its

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
filaments and that's important for its
biological<00:00:54.149> role<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.539> we'll<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> little

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
biological role as we'll see a little

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.270 
biological role as we'll see a little
bit<00:00:55.680> later<00:00:56.390> think<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> bicycle<00:00:57.870> frame

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
bit later think about a bicycle frame

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
bit later think about a bicycle frame
it's<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.940> series<00:01:00.330> of<00:01:00.360> hollow<00:01:00.930> cylinders<00:01:01.650> hollow

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's a series of hollow cylinders hollow

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
it's a series of hollow cylinders hollow
metal<00:01:02.280> cylinders<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.330> makes<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.690> very

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
metal cylinders and that makes it very

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.770 
metal cylinders and that makes it very
sturdy<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.010> strong<00:01:05.670> able<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.270> withstand<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
sturdy very strong able to withstand a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
sturdy very strong able to withstand a
lot<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> pressure<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:08.280> instead<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.910> took<00:01:09.120> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
lot of pressure if instead we took that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
lot of pressure if instead we took that
same<00:01:09.720> framework<00:01:10.140> melted<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.160> down<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
same framework melted it down and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
same framework melted it down and
composed<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.870> solid<00:01:13.080> rods<00:01:13.620> they've<00:01:14.040> made

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
composed it into solid rods they've made

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
composed it into solid rods they've made
much<00:01:14.640> weaker<00:01:15.150> much<00:01:15.720> less<00:01:15.990> able<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> handle

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
much weaker much less able to handle

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280 
much weaker much less able to handle
that<00:01:17.010> stress<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that stress and that has to do with the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
that stress and that has to do with the
structure<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:20.119> microtubules<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
structure of microtubules this

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
structure of microtubules this
cylindrical<00:01:21.900> form<00:01:22.500> let's<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.729> bit

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
cylindrical form let's look a little bit

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.620 
cylindrical form let's look a little bit
more<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.660> tubulin<00:01:25.170> dimer<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.940> here<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.360> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
more that tubulin dimer so here we have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
more that tubulin dimer so here we have
the<00:01:28.430> structure<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.630> alpha<00:01:30.630> beta<00:01:30.780> tubulin<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the structure of alpha beta tubulin the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
the structure of alpha beta tubulin the
alpha<00:01:31.860> subunit<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.550> green<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> beta<00:01:33.300> in<00:01:33.570> blue

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
alpha subunit in green the beta in blue

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.950 
alpha subunit in green the beta in blue
you<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.490> alpha<00:01:36.030> helixes<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.540> beta

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you can see the alpha helixes and beta

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
you can see the alpha helixes and beta
strands<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> loops<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.369> form<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
strands and the loops that form the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
strands and the loops that form the
secondary<00:01:39.330> structure<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.710> structures

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
secondary structure over all structures

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
secondary structure over all structures
globular<00:01:41.940> for<00:01:42.149> each<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> monomers<00:01:43.050> just

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
globular for each of the monomers just

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.779 
globular for each of the monomers just
like<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.649> saw<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.039> act<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
like we saw and act and that's the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.940 
like we saw and act and that's the
tertiary<00:01:45.119> structure<00:01:45.660> here<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.800> have<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
tertiary structure here we have a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
tertiary structure here we have a
quaternary<00:01:47.490> structure<00:01:48.060> though<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.420> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
quaternary structure though because we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
quaternary structure though because we
have<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.050> separate<00:01:49.470> subunits<00:01:50.210> you'll<00:01:51.210> notice

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
have two separate subunits you'll notice

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
have two separate subunits you'll notice
also<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.050> both<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.800> alpha<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.369> beta

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
also that both the alpha and beta

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.210 
also that both the alpha and beta
subunits<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:54.479> nucleotide<00:01:55.200> binding<00:01:55.530> proteins

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
subunits are nucleotide binding proteins

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.029 
subunits are nucleotide binding proteins
just<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.880> saw<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.240> actin<00:01:57.690> in<00:01:57.920> actin<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
just like we saw with actin in actin it

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.990 
just like we saw with actin in actin it
was<00:01:59.160> ATP<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.780> case<00:02:01.050> it's<00:02:01.380> gtp<00:02:02.190> perhaps

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
was ATP in this case it's gtp perhaps

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.120 
was ATP in this case it's gtp perhaps
the<00:02:03.270> best<00:02:03.510> way<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.720> remember<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.560> actin

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the best way to remember that is actin

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.990 
the best way to remember that is actin
binds<00:02:05.790> ATP<00:02:06.650> so<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:08.010> significance<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
binds ATP so the significance is the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
binds ATP so the significance is the
same<00:02:09.269> it<00:02:09.510> binds<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:10.170> nucleotides<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:11.070> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
same it binds these nucleotides in this

within the protein it's not solvent
exposed<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.829> tells<00:02:47.220> us<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.510> GTP<00:02:48.510> will<00:02:48.720> not

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
be hydrolyzed

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.809 
be hydrolyzed
but<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:51.380> we<00:02:51.590> look<00:02:51.770> at<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> beta<00:02:52.190> subunit

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
but if we look at the beta subunit

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.140 
but if we look at the beta subunit
here's<00:02:53.090> our<00:02:53.270> gtp<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.290> similar<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.520> act<00:02:55.819> in

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
here's our gtp and similar to act in

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.180 
here's our gtp and similar to act in
those<00:02:56.540> nucleotide<00:02:57.260> binding<00:02:57.500> sites<00:02:57.980> are

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
those nucleotide binding sites are

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.430 
those nucleotide binding sites are
towards<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.550> top<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:59.090> molecule<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.230> this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
towards the top of the molecule but this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.199 
towards the top of the molecule but this
one<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.770> solvent<00:03:01.160> exposed<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> beta

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
one is solvent exposed in the beta

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.180 
one is solvent exposed in the beta
subunit<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.140> that's<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.680> one<00:03:03.830> that's<00:03:03.980> going

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
subunit so that's the one that's going

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.410 
subunit so that's the one that's going
to<00:03:04.250> get<00:03:04.400> hydrolyzed<00:03:05.030> as<00:03:05.360> we'll<00:03:05.569> see<00:03:07.420> these

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
to get hydrolyzed as we'll see these

alpha<00:03:09.230> beta<00:03:09.410> tubulin<00:03:09.739> dimers<00:03:10.670> will<00:03:10.880> assemble

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
alpha beta tubulin dimers will assemble

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.970 
alpha beta tubulin dimers will assemble
into<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.599> proto<00:03:11.870> filament<00:03:12.470> they<00:03:12.800> will

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
into the proto filament they will

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.670 
into the proto filament they will
assemble<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.640> as<00:03:13.880> discussant<00:03:14.690> actin<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
assemble and as discussant actin the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.370 
assemble and as discussant actin the
dimer<00:03:16.130> will<00:03:16.550> add<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.420> filament<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.080> then

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
dimer will add to the filament and then

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.490 
dimer will add to the filament and then
GTP<00:03:19.069> is<00:03:19.099> hydrolyzed<00:03:19.819> we<00:03:20.750> only<00:03:21.019> need<00:03:21.349> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
GTP is hydrolyzed we only need the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.789 
GTP is hydrolyzed we only need the
amount<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.800> energy<00:03:22.069> in<00:03:22.370> one<00:03:23.500> phosphate<00:03:24.500> bond

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
amount of energy in one phosphate bond

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.449 
amount of energy in one phosphate bond
and<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.700> we<00:03:25.850> only<00:03:26.030> hydrolyze<00:03:26.690> one<00:03:27.019> GTP<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:28.069> as

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
and so we only hydrolyze one GTP just as

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.240 
and so we only hydrolyze one GTP just as
we<00:03:28.760> only<00:03:28.940> needed<00:03:29.239> one<00:03:29.540> ATP<00:03:29.989> hydrolysis<00:03:30.860> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
we only needed one ATP hydrolysis to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.390 
we only needed one ATP hydrolysis to
drive<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.670> assembly<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:33.160> one<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
monomers to the filament in this case

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.440 
monomers to the filament in this case
how<00:03:37.489> we're<00:03:37.760> going<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.940> take<00:03:38.239> those

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
how we're going to take those

protofilaments and line them up
side-by-side<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:41.540> form<00:03:41.840> our<00:03:42.019> cylinder<00:03:42.560> it's

side-by-side to form our cylinder it's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
going to take about 13 of those to do

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.460 
going to take about 13 of those to do
that<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:46.640> other<00:03:46.790> thing<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.209> find<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:47.840> it

that the other thing we find is that it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
dimers add more readily to the plus end

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.720 
dimers add more readily to the plus end
than<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.299> minus<00:03:56.840> end<00:03:57.079> we<00:03:57.980> notice<00:03:58.280> also<00:03:58.519> that

than the minus end we notice also that

these dimers can add at any point in
this<00:04:01.220> process<00:04:01.459> while<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:02.299> forming<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
this process while it's forming the

this process while it's forming the
proto<00:04:03.140> filament<00:04:03.769> in<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.459> process<00:04:04.970> of

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
proto filament in the process of

proto filament in the process of
assembling<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.810> cylinder<00:04:06.260> or<00:04:06.410> after<00:04:07.069> the

assembling the cylinder or after the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.840 
assembling the cylinder or after the
cylinder<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.819> assembled

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850

cylinder is assembled
these<00:04:10.850> structures<00:04:11.360> are<00:04:11.690> used<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.020> construct

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
these structures are used to construct

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.860 
these structures are used to construct
cilia<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:12.980> flagella<00:04:13.100> very<00:04:14.090> large<00:04:14.390> structural

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
cilia and flagella very large structural

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.540 
cilia and flagella very large structural
components<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.770> subject<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.370> lot<00:04:16.520> of

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
components and subject to a lot of

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.370 
components and subject to a lot of
frictional<00:04:17.120> force<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:17.840> they<00:04:17.989> need<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.230> be

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
frictional force and so they need to be

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.370 
frictional force and so they need to be
very<00:04:18.709> strong<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.940> other<00:04:20.090> biological<00:04:20.930> role<00:04:21.140> is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
very strong the other biological role is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.960 
very strong the other biological role is
that<00:04:21.410> they're<00:04:21.709> used<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.040> align<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.550> separate

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
that they're used to align and separate

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.270 
that they're used to align and separate
pairs<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.420> chromosomes<00:04:24.020> during<00:04:24.440> mitosis

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
pairs of chromosomes during mitosis

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.790 
pairs of chromosomes during mitosis
so<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.090> case<00:04:26.360> structure<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.260> stability

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
so in that case structure and stability

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.610 
so in that case structure and stability
is<00:04:28.250> absolutely<00:04:29.120> essential<00:04:29.450> again<00:04:30.350> its

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
is absolutely essential again its

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.560 
is absolutely essential again its
structure<00:04:31.100> fits<00:04:31.340> perfectly<00:04:31.910> its<00:04:32.120> function

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
structure fits perfectly its function

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.720 
structure fits perfectly its function
within<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.990> cell<00:04:33.230> on<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:34.040> upper<00:04:34.340> left<00:04:34.610> you

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
within the cell on the upper left you

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.960 
within the cell on the upper left you
can<00:04:34.790> see<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.060> Crayola<00:04:35.530> electron<00:04:36.760> micrograph<00:04:37.760> of

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
can see a Crayola electron micrograph of

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.360 
can see a Crayola electron micrograph of
the<00:04:38.930> microtubule<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.860> get<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> little<00:04:40.250> bit

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
the microtubule you get a little bit

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.590 
the microtubule you get a little bit
better<00:04:40.520> idea<00:04:40.820> of<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.870> shape<00:04:42.140> of<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:43.450> in<00:04:44.450> our

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
better idea of the shape of that in our

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.060 
better idea of the shape of that in our
next<00:04:44.810> lesson<00:04:45.080> we're<00:04:45.350> going<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.530> start<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.920> look

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
next lesson we're going to start to look

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.680 
next lesson we're going to start to look
at<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.310> intermediate<00:04:46.700> filaments<00:04:47.450> we'll<00:04:47.600> look

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
at the intermediate filaments we'll look

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.750 
at the intermediate filaments we'll look
at<00:04:47.870> keratin<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.590> how<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.860> forms<00:04:49.190> complex

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
at keratin and how it forms complex

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.730 
at keratin and how it forms complex
structures<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.420> are<00:04:50.540> present<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.050> skin

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
structures that are present and skin

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.860 
structures that are present and skin
hair<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.160> nails<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:53.000> then<00:04:53.480> we'll<00:04:53.600> look<00:04:53.720> at

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
hair and nails and then we'll look at

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.230 
hair and nails and then we'll look at
the<00:04:53.960> basic<00:04:54.350> structure<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:54.830> collagen<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.610> how

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
the basic structure of collagen and how

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.270 
the basic structure of collagen and how
it<00:04:56.540> is<00:04:56.690> symbols<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.320> form<00:04:57.560> more<00:04:57.740> complex

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
it is symbols to form more complex

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.730 
it is symbols to form more complex
structures
