all<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.880> want<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.830> mention<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.130> fact<00:00:14.160> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
all I want to mention the fact that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.939 
all I want to mention the fact that
reviewing<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> show<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:16.770> actually

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
reviewing a show like this was actually

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
reviewing a show like this was actually
quite<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.369> challenge<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:18.029> me<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:18.180> it's

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
quite a challenge for me because it's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.900 
quite a challenge for me because it's
very<00:00:18.779> outside<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.560> realm<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> shows<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
very outside the realm of shows that I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.090 
very outside the realm of shows that I
normally<00:00:21.000> watch<00:00:21.560> obviously<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> setting<00:00:22.949> is

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
normally watch obviously the setting is

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.509 
normally watch obviously the setting is
in<00:00:23.519> high<00:00:23.760> school<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:25.199> lack<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
in high school and the lack of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.670 
in high school and the lack of
overarching<00:00:26.519> plot<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.080> makes<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
overarching plot kind of makes it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
overarching plot kind of makes it
difficult<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.330> characters<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> how

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
difficult to look at characters and how

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
difficult to look at characters and how
they<00:00:31.320> evolved<00:00:31.740> over<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> series<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> even

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
they evolved over the series and even

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.810 
they evolved over the series and even
makes<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.079> seem<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> stagnant<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
makes them seem kind of stagnant but the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
makes them seem kind of stagnant but the
show<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.059> first<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> foremost<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.410> comedy<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
show is first and foremost a comedy and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
show is first and foremost a comedy and
most<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.879> those<00:00:39.030> comedic<00:00:39.450> moments<00:00:39.649> spring

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
most of those comedic moments spring

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
most of those comedic moments spring
from<00:00:41.010> awkward<00:00:41.750> interactions<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
from awkward interactions and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
from awkward interactions and
misunderstandings<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> show

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
misunderstandings I think it's a show

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900 
misunderstandings I think it's a show
that<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.539> appreciated<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.829> relatable<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that can be appreciated and relatable to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.990 
that can be appreciated and relatable to
most<00:00:48.210> people<00:00:48.660> even<00:00:48.930> those<00:00:49.320> who<00:00:50.010> aren't<00:00:50.370> have

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
most people even those who aren't have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
most people even those who aren't have
never<00:00:51.360> been<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.050> never<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.920> high

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
never been and will never be a high

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
never been and will never be a high

they<00:00:55.739> face<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.180> with

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
they face have more to do with

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
they face have more to do with
conquering<00:00:57.780> boredom<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:58.680> actually<00:00:59.399> being<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
conquering boredom than actually being a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
conquering boredom than actually being a
high<00:00:59.969> school<00:01:00.000> boy<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> mind

high school boy with this in mind
oftentimes<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.070> characters<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.609> off<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
oftentimes the characters go off on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
oftentimes the characters go off on
seemingly<00:01:03.449> random<00:01:04.110> tangents<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.220> not

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
seemingly random tangents and it's not

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.179 
seemingly random tangents and it's not
always<00:01:06.119> entirely<00:01:06.540> clear<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> skit<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
always entirely clear when the skit is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
always entirely clear when the skit is
going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> F<00:01:08.729> occasionally<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> stories<00:01:10.080> will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
going to F occasionally the stories will

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
going to F occasionally the stories will
fall<00:01:10.710> flat<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.460> okay<00:01:11.820> because

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
fall flat but that's okay because

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
fall flat but that's okay because
they're<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> couple<00:01:13.260> minutes<00:01:13.530> anyway

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
they're all just a couple minutes anyway

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
they're all just a couple minutes anyway
and<00:01:14.280> maybe<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> next<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.060> funny<00:01:15.330> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and maybe the next one will be funny for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.149 
and maybe the next one will be funny for
the<00:01:15.810> most<00:01:15.990> part<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.530> say<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.950> was

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the most part I would say that I was

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.649 
the most part I would say that I was
laughing<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:17.970> entertained<00:01:18.450> by<00:01:18.600> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
laughing and I was entertained by this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
laughing and I was entertained by this
show<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.439> feeling<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> would

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
show but I get the feeling that it would

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
show but I get the feeling that it would
be<00:01:20.369> even<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.640> enjoyable<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.810> were<00:01:21.930> watching

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
be even more enjoyable you were watching

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
be even more enjoyable you were watching
with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> bunch<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> friends<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
with a bunch of friends I do think that

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
with a bunch of friends I do think that
the<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.540> half<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:25.049> funnier<00:01:25.439> than<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the first half was funnier than the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.130 
the first half was funnier than the
second<00:01:26.009> half<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.630> enjoyed<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
second half but I really enjoyed the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
second half but I really enjoyed the
intentional<00:01:28.740> comedy<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.150> know

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
intentional comedy of it all you know

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
intentional comedy of it all you know
how<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> tend<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> laugh<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.650> inappropriate

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
how I tend to laugh at inappropriate

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
how I tend to laugh at inappropriate
times<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:32.880> characters<00:01:33.360> die<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.140> when

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
times like when characters die or when

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.350 
times like when characters die or when
their<00:01:34.470> dreams<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.979> shattered<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> was

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
their dreams are shattered so it was

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230 
their dreams are shattered so it was
nice<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.350> laugh<00:01:37.590> at<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.790> everyone

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
nice to laugh at a time when everyone

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
nice to laugh at a time when everyone
else<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.630> supposed<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> laugh<00:01:40.409> too<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.979> you're

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
taste of what we could expect the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
taste of what we could expect the
premise<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> show<00:02:30.870> had<00:02:31.230> never<00:02:31.470> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
premise of the show had never really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
premise of the show had never really
been<00:02:32.100> introduced<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> first<00:02:33.570> episode

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
been introduced in the first episode

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.450 
been introduced in the first episode
because<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.530> were<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.770> kind<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.010> plopped

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
because we were just kind of plopped

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.670 
because we were just kind of plopped
down<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.600> middle<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.990> one<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.440> many

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
down into the middle of one of the many

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.470 
down into the middle of one of the many
conversations<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.760> would<00:02:38.940> overhear

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
conversations that we would overhear

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
conversations that we would overhear
throughout<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> series<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> bit

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
throughout the series I was a bit

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
throughout the series I was a bit
nervous<00:02:41.400> about<00:02:41.850> how<00:02:42.090> they<00:02:42.240> were<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> end

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
nervous about how they were going to end

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.140 
nervous about how they were going to end
the<00:02:42.840> show<00:02:43.080> when<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.100> could<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.460> just<00:02:44.490> seemed

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the show when it could have just seemed

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
the show when it could have just seemed
like<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.570> end<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.960> another<00:02:46.320> skit<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> think

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
like the end of another skit but I think

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.800 
like the end of another skit but I think
that<00:02:47.610> they<00:02:47.820> actually<00:02:47.940> did<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> really<00:02:48.540> good<00:02:48.750> job

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that they actually did a really good job

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.810 
that they actually did a really good job
it<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> cool<00:02:49.800> way<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.550> make<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
it was a cool way to do it to make the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.610 
it was a cool way to do it to make the
end<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.450> seemed<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.020> beginning<00:02:52.320> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
end kind of seemed like the beginning so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
end kind of seemed like the beginning so
it<00:02:52.710> all<00:02:52.800> comes<00:02:52.980> full<00:02:53.250> circle<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it all comes full circle now of all the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.010 
it all comes full circle now of all the
shows<00:02:55.560> I've<00:02:55.770> watched<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.280> far<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.780> has

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
shows I've watched so far this one has

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.710 
shows I've watched so far this one has
definitely<00:02:58.650> helped<00:02:59.250> me<00:02:59.520> with<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.210> Japanese

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720

definitely helped me with my Japanese
the<00:03:00.990> most<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.950> very<00:03:02.130> situational<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.000> relies

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the most it's very situational it relies

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.800 
the most it's very situational it relies
on<00:03:03.690> typical<00:03:04.530> conversations<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:06.360> usually

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
on typical conversations and is usually

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.930 
on typical conversations and is usually
just<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.470> topic<00:03:07.920> once<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.520> get<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
just one topic once you get to the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760 
just one topic once you get to the
groove<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.330> scene<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:10.110> becomes<00:03:10.500> very<00:03:10.680> easy

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
groove of the scene it becomes very easy

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.440 
groove of the scene it becomes very easy
to<00:03:11.190> anticipate<00:03:11.730> what's<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.210> come<00:03:12.390> next

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450

in<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> conversation<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.550> say<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.850> the

Tata<00:03:26.790> Cooney<00:03:27.120> literally<00:03:27.750> stopped<00:03:28.260> appearing

Tata Cooney literally stopped appearing

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.190 
Tata Cooney literally stopped appearing
in<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> show<00:03:29.390> several<00:03:30.390> episodes<00:03:30.630> from<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
in the show several episodes from the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.380 
in the show several episodes from the
end<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.860> understand<00:03:32.310> why<00:03:32.490> because<00:03:33.060> he<00:03:33.240> was

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
end then I understand why because he was

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.760 
end then I understand why because he was
the<00:03:33.420> straight<00:03:33.810> man<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.290> had<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> least

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
the straight man and had the least

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.470 
the straight man and had the least
interesting<00:03:35.340> personality<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.240> all<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
interesting personality out of all the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.390 
interesting personality out of all the
boys<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.770> point<00:03:38.160> to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
boys but I think it was the point to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.030 
boys but I think it was the point to
kind<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.670> focus<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.630> average<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.650> then

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
kind of focus on the average and then

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.220 
kind of focus on the average and then
give<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> little<00:03:41.460> twist<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.270> think<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.990> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
give a little twist I think that the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.260 
give a little twist I think that the
abandoning<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.130> Tata<00:03:44.340> Cooney<00:03:44.760> kind<00:03:45.090> of

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
abandoning of Tata Cooney kind of

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.260 
abandoning of Tata Cooney kind of
shifted<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.230> show<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.640> focus<00:03:48.030> more<00:03:48.240> on

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
shifted the show a bit to focus more on

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.900 
shifted the show a bit to focus more on
wacky<00:03:48.690> situations<00:03:49.350> as<00:03:49.710> opposed<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.550> our

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
wacky situations as opposed to our

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640 
wacky situations as opposed to our
characters<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.960> maybe<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> was<00:03:52.560> an

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
characters and maybe that was an

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.000 
characters and maybe that was an
intentional<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:54.440> still<00:03:55.440> found<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.800> funny

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
intentional and I still found it funny

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.430 
intentional and I still found it funny
when<00:03:56.130> he<00:03:56.490> was<00:03:56.640> there<00:03:56.880> versus<00:03:57.510> when<00:03:57.540> he<00:03:58.050> wasn't

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
when he was there versus when he wasn't

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.310 
when he was there versus when he wasn't
there<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.700> wish<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.270> he<00:04:00.750> had<00:04:00.780> stayed

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
there but I wish that he had stayed

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.200 
there but I wish that he had stayed
throughout<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.310> although<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.760> story<00:04:03.060> is

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
an interesting choice to kind of just

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.440 
an interesting choice to kind of just

school girls at the end of each episode
for<00:05:11.400> them<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.730> got<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.090> point<00:05:12.120> where<00:05:12.450> it

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
for them it got to the point where it

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.300 
for them it got to the point where it
was<00:05:12.540> just<00:05:12.870> pure<00:05:13.140> farce<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.100> wasn't

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
was just pure farce and it wasn't

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.550 
was just pure farce and it wasn't
realistic<00:05:14.700> in<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> slightest<00:05:15.660> bit<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:16.320> draw

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
realistic in the slightest bit the draw

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.290 
realistic in the slightest bit the draw
of<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.860> show<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.520> realism<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.120> it

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
of the show is the realism that it

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.090 
of the show is the realism that it
portrays<00:05:18.480> with<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.290> high<00:05:19.380> school<00:05:19.650> boys<00:05:19.830> but

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
portrays with the high school boys but

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.160 
portrays with the high school boys but
then<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.340> just<00:05:20.490> throws<00:05:21.120> its<00:05:21.510> hands<00:05:21.930> up<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.140> the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
then it just throws its hands up in the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.960 
then it just throws its hands up in the
air<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.710> gives<00:05:22.980> up<00:05:23.250> when<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.520> comes<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.850> the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
air and gives up when it comes to the

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.300 
air and gives up when it comes to the
girls<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.660> boys<00:05:24.870> for<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.410> most<00:05:25.620> part<00:05:25.830> acted

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
girls the boys for the most part acted

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.280 
girls the boys for the most part acted
like<00:05:26.460> high<00:05:26.700> school<00:05:26.970> boys<00:05:27.180> whereas<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> girls

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
like high school boys whereas the girls

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.920 
like high school boys whereas the girls
acted<00:05:28.800> like<00:05:28.980> anime<00:05:29.490> characters<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.240> perhaps

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
acted like anime characters and perhaps

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.780 
acted like anime characters and perhaps
that<00:05:31.350> was<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.680> point<00:05:31.920> maybe<00:05:32.490> they<00:05:32.730> were

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
that was the point maybe they were

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.970 
that was the point maybe they were
playing<00:05:33.090> with<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.450> fact<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.740> girls

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
playing with the fact that the girls

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.170 
playing with the fact that the girls
were<00:05:35.130> not<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.400> focus<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:35.970> show<00:05:36.000> and

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
were not the focus of the show and

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.970 
were not the focus of the show and
therefore<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.020> was<00:05:37.140> okay<00:05:37.470> for<00:05:37.500> them<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:37.860> just

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
therefore it was okay for them to just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.550 
therefore it was okay for them to just
be<00:05:38.280> totally<00:05:38.460> inaccurate<00:05:39.030> but<00:05:39.870> it<00:05:40.020> just<00:05:40.260> got

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
be totally inaccurate but it just got

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.860 
be totally inaccurate but it just got
tiresome<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.700> annoying<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.420> it<00:05:42.720> would

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
tiresome and annoying and it would

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.200 
tiresome and annoying and it would
totally<00:05:43.830> suck<00:05:44.100> because<00:05:44.490> I'd<00:05:44.670> enjoy<00:05:44.850> an

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
totally suck because I'd enjoy an

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.120 
totally suck because I'd enjoy an
episode<00:05:45.600> and<00:05:45.750> then<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.960> last<00:05:46.200> scene<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.620> every

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
episode and then the last scene of every

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.700 
episode and then the last scene of every
episode<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.790> these<00:05:48.540> high<00:05:48.750> school<00:05:49.020> girls<00:05:49.050> and

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
episode is these high school girls and

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.410 
episode is these high school girls and
it<00:05:49.980> just<00:05:50.010> kind<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.370> left<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.670> sour<00:05:50.850> taste<00:05:51.030> in<00:05:51.390> my

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
it just kind of left a sour taste in my

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.180 
it just kind of left a sour taste in my
mouth<00:05:51.480> every<00:05:51.810> time<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.080> walked<00:05:52.320> away<00:05:52.470> anyway

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
mouth every time I walked away anyway

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.100
