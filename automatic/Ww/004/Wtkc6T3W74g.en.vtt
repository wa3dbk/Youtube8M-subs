thing that I miss was if your own like a

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.770 
thing that I miss was if your own like a
sports<00:05:30.580> team<00:05:30.790> or<00:05:30.910> something<00:05:31.270> like<00:05:31.420> that<00:05:31.480> I

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
sports team or something like that I

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.210 
sports team or something like that I
know<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.080> couple<00:05:32.350> years<00:05:32.590> ago<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:32.920> played

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
know a couple years ago I played

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.340 
know a couple years ago I played
basketball<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:34.210> you're<00:05:34.600> not<00:05:34.690> like<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.170> our

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
basketball and you're not like to our

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.350 
basketball and you're not like to our
practices<00:05:36.040> like<00:05:36.280> three<00:05:36.610> times<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:37.000> week<00:05:37.030> and

practices like three times a week and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.440 
practices like three times a week and
that<00:05:37.810> really<00:05:38.200> I<00:05:39.270> struggled<00:05:40.270> with<00:05:40.330> that

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
that really I struggled with that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.880 
that really I struggled with that
because<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:40.990> know<00:05:41.080> it's<00:05:41.230> really<00:05:41.380> hard<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.800> you

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
because you know it's really hard to you

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.830 
because you know it's really hard to you
know<00:05:41.920> get<00:05:42.220> home<00:05:42.430> quickly<00:05:43.030> dinner<00:05:43.390> then<00:05:43.660> go<00:05:43.780> to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
know get home quickly dinner then go to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.480 
know get home quickly dinner then go to
practice<00:05:44.110> come<00:05:44.620> back<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.010> then<00:05:45.100> you're<00:05:45.220> tired

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
practice come back and then you're tired

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.240 
practice come back and then you're tired
then<00:05:45.760> you<00:05:46.120> don't<00:05:46.330> feel<00:05:46.540> like<00:05:46.660> doing<00:05:46.780> anything

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
then you don't feel like doing anything

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.530 
then you don't feel like doing anything
but<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.280> don't<00:05:48.550> know<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.790> just<00:05:48.820> feels<00:05:49.060> like<00:05:49.390> my

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
but I don't know it just feels like my

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.210 
but I don't know it just feels like my
mind<00:05:49.810> is<00:05:49.960> on<00:05:50.110> overload<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:51.040> I'm<00:05:51.190> thinking

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220
