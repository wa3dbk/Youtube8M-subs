00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
now this little two-thirds circle right

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.800 
now this little two-thirds circle right
here<00:03:04.530> will<00:03:05.190> indicate<00:03:05.370> which<00:03:06.359> sides<00:03:06.629> of<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
here will indicate which sides of the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.289

backside<00:03:07.230> now<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.859> broken<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.819> broken

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
backside now it's broken and this broken

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.509 
backside now it's broken and this broken
section<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> back<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.859> back<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.459> if

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
section in the back is the back so if

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.339 
section in the back is the back so if
I'm<00:03:11.640> saying<00:03:11.819> right<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.629> this<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> back

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
I'm saying right here this is the back

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.890 
I'm saying right here this is the back
this<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:14.040> still<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.489> back<00:03:14.609> but<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
this is still the back but this is the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.839 
this is still the back but this is the
side<00:03:16.109> of<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.379> creature<00:03:16.560> also<00:03:17.370> known<00:03:17.549> as<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.190 
side of the creature also known as the
