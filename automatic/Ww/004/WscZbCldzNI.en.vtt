00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
there's no reason to review miller lite

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.040 
there's no reason to review miller lite
but<00:00:29.339> since<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.669> have<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> new<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.509> out<00:00:30.749> called

the punch top can I thought that they
were<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.469> try<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> motivate<00:00:35.160> people<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
now let's go for step two so instead of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.410 
now let's go for step two so instead of
obviously<00:01:15.530> punching<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.460> hole<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.940> bottom

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
obviously punching a hole in the bottom

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.630 
obviously punching a hole in the bottom
and<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:17.840> opening<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:19.010> just<00:01:19.250> open<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.940> and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
and then opening it you just open it and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:32.899 
and then opening it you just open it and
sugar

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.569 

oh<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> obviously<00:01:35.189> been<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.429> while<00:01:40.460> not<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
oh it's obviously been a while not that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:02:01.360 
oh it's obviously been a while not that
I<00:01:41.670> ever<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:42.149> do<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> mom<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.840> dad

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.910 

so<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:03.280> Miller<00:02:04.280> Lite<00:02:05.920> three

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
but overall it seems to work so Miller

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:23.450 
but overall it seems to work so Miller
Lite<00:02:13.880> wants<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.420> shotgun<00:02:14.840> beers
