00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
container at first I thought that those

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
container at first I thought that those
two<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.830> packets<00:01:26.340> weren't<00:01:26.700> gonna<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
two little packets weren't gonna be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.080 
two little packets weren't gonna be
enough<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.200> didn't<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.579> they

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
enough because I didn't think that they

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
enough because I didn't think that they
would<00:01:30.240> expend<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.890> did<00:01:31.950> when

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
would expend as much as they did when

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
would expend as much as they did when
you<00:01:33.030> add<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> water<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> next<00:01:36.600> step<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you add the water the next step is to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
you add the water the next step is to
add<00:01:38.270> 1/4<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> cup<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.110> water<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.490> want

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
add 1/4 of a cup of water and you want

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.810 
add 1/4 of a cup of water and you want
to<00:01:41.880> add<00:01:42.150> purified<00:01:42.930> water<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to add purified water you don't want it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
to add purified water you don't want it
to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.899> top<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> don't

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
harsh minerals into the soil because you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.230

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
I was amazed when I when I first saw

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.910 
I was amazed when I when I first saw
because<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.900> haven't<00:02:15.200> seen<00:02:15.349> anything<00:02:15.890> that

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
because I haven't seen anything that

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.360 
because I haven't seen anything that
expands<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.599> much<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.590> filled<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> entire

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
expands that much it filled the entire

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.089 
expands that much it filled the entire
container<00:02:19.909> which<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.599> was<00:02:21.349> really<00:02:21.620> surprised

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
container which I was really surprised

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.649 
container which I was really surprised
and<00:02:23.890> another<00:02:24.890> thing<00:02:25.609> about<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.030> soil<00:02:26.269> is<00:02:26.480> that

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
and another thing about the soil is that

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.000 
and another thing about the soil is that
it<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:26.930> let<00:02:27.109> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.439> when<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.829> need<00:02:27.980> to

it will let you know when you need to
add<00:02:28.280> water<00:02:28.579> because<00:02:29.090> it'll<00:02:29.599> start<00:02:30.560> drying<00:02:30.889> up

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
add water because it'll start drying up

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.449 
add water because it'll start drying up
it'll<00:02:31.489> turn<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> light<00:02:32.469> brown<00:02:33.469> color<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
it'll turn a light brown color and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.809 
it'll turn a light brown color and
that's<00:02:34.579> when<00:02:34.879> you<00:02:34.969> know<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> add<00:02:35.829> your<00:02:37.299> water

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
that's when you know to add your water

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.449 
that's when you know to add your water
so<00:02:40.819> for<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.810> instructions<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.859> need<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.250> add

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
so for the instructions you need to add

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.500 
so for the instructions you need to add
four<00:02:43.939> to<00:02:44.239> five<00:02:44.599> seeds<00:02:45.319> into<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.510> container

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
four to five seeds into the container

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.099 
four to five seeds into the container
into<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.200> greenhouse<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.359> when<00:02:50.359> you<00:02:50.659> handle

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
into the greenhouse and when you handle

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.569 
into the greenhouse and when you handle
the<00:02:51.230> seeds<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.680> want<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.099> extra<00:02:52.519> careful

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
the seeds you want to be extra careful

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.709 
the seeds you want to be extra careful
because<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.750> are<00:02:54.370> very<00:02:55.370> thin<00:02:55.879> they're<00:02:56.299> frail

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
because they are very thin they're frail

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:02.409 
because they are very thin they're frail
and<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:58.099> don't<00:02:58.280> want<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.519> break<00:02:58.790> them<00:02:59.090> I<00:03:01.419> don't

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
and you don't want to break them I don't

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.179 
and you don't want to break them I don't
know<00:03:02.510> why<00:03:02.659> they<00:03:02.780> would<00:03:02.930> put<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.439> foil<00:03:03.799> type

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.559 
know why they would put in a foil type
container<00:03:06.189> so<00:03:07.189> just<00:03:07.489> made<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.329> little

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569
