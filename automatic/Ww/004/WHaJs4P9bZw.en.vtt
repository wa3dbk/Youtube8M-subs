00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 hello and welcome to my fast 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.949
 tutorial for strip mining simple here 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'll show you just like you did 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.880
 So my best ones are coming there 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.520
 not my side but mine 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.040
 section the code I use for that 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.320
 script mining we have done that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 eur turtle could copy that way 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 that he can use it directly 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
 Of course, we'll just give you rich 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.239
 in the door first 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 let's check if the turtle is loaded 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.660
 Loading means you need electricity year 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.739
 was a called one sees revival is 0 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.879
 you simply fill them up 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 either with coal or with lava that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.730
 works be as important as 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 a lot then he would join us if we did 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
 how much a cool one 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.860
 pull in and 80 means I believe 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.590
 been for 80 units are faith 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.300
 I have a blog 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.899
 Of course we can now also called the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.490
 number I enter with it 31 1 day 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.590
 he took the 31 out 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.930
 Of course I could also do a lot 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.729
 then every section would do what 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 fill in is ok next 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 of course we want the code so 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.329
 typing was a free post job 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.650
 have vacancy in the clipboard 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.000
 I already saved the coach like one 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.979
 looks frey place and there we give one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.990
 name we want to use then 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.610
 to start the turtle means 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 we'll type in a very creative way 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.220
 strip a comment from expand com 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 and he has already downloaded great 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.390
 I think it's cool 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 ok now we could of course the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 Turtle already start with a strip 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 we have to go down to the 16x 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.100
 and put in a torch here 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.040
 that is, turkey would last so long 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 run until either regular or the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.519
 torches are all so it must be both 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 always be present otherwise works 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.620
 the cake is not in the program 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.110
 if we break down the turtle but now 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.180
 now as it is, we would have to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.290
 every time enter this code 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.659
 we do not want that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.349
 So we give the turtle revenue and 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.030
 Although we go then a label set 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.670
 vacancies and income I call 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.120
 they even took big I do not like that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.069
 so 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.150
 despite being totally just rich we have 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.340
 now down here, I just have a 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.069
 do quantity and that has no name so 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.430
 if I can see the current workings 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.829
 all right 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 we dismantled that then I sit down 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.959
 Right-click now 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.579
 program imaginative and you see 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.609
 the strip is still in there 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.519
 so of course we can do the turtle now 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.010
 also stars must be called I give now 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.069
 32 torch no, that's how far I would go 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.389
 not stripped and he's already running 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.400
 Let's go, and once it goes up and 232 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.239
 two far in and then dig each 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.409
 to the left and right 1 5 long corridor 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.450
 that means you can always be nice 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.099
 go through and see and do 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.639
 and do and you should why I had 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.750
 almost made would not proceed with the turtle 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.859
 what I wanted to show you is the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.590
 turtle is of course set 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.349
 everything that falls down controls here 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.790
 everytime whether there are levels before you 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.739
 continues that is always waiting 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.819
 as a second or half-second 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.739
 Check if there is something there 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.540
 not to say it yet 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.409
 a lot of 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.729
 that was it already with the 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.040
 piece of opinion that is now from the 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:49.560
 Weigh what you can see 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.940
 if of course the turtle is to end 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.979
 everything is ready then it stops 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.329
 So if no torches but remains 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.879
 at the end is quite stand then could they 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.949
 refill always important respects 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.199
 on it for the sake of keeping the review filled 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.780
 is and on the torches otherwise 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.220
 that does not otherwise mutate them and said 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.829
 I do not mind anymore I do not want to 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.359
 Of course you can do it more now 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.229
 here really nice money in the aisles 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.159
 lined raussuchen what you had in there because 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:17.009
 and go to the next walk 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.299
 raussuchen what has and you 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.729
 must you no make care if 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.389
 for example, at level 10 11 or 12 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.090
 Degree 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.220
 The turtle can not be stored 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.750
 destroyed if so runs through 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.060
 lava through that goes through water like that 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.920
 by which he makes great nothing and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.870
 even if she grows those 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.450
 as she normally has the stone mining 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.850
 also off and then you have everything here 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.700
 inside the turtle inside 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.590
 I'm not going to go now if 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.190
 Of course it go off like alicia when 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.510
 it when it is full drop the things 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.310
 then just go and throw it 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.410
 things out so I do not recommend you 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.770
 so many flares do not make it so 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.090
 64 pieces that would be total 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.530
 imbecile what I of course now 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.700
 Show this is when I am here 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.820
 now stand in front of zac 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.650
 she stops and it irritates 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.870
 she would have as abberger 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.940
 this is the typical demonstration effect 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.130
 if any questions are to 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.330
 Write me the comments I try 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.160
 Of course, it's all about you again 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.550
 help us answer 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.120
 a detailed tutorial about the 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.320
 amount and today I still do that 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.970
 just takes a little bit because 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.860
 of course that's a bit 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.670
 in more detail yes i hope i could 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.080
 help you with that 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.130
 no to say subscribers for free and 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.130
 tastes good until the next
