00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
comfortable I like it I think it'd look

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.560

better<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> beard<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.210> honest<00:00:18.449> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
better with the beard to be honest it

might<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.990> say<00:00:19.080> he's<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> little<00:00:19.529> bit<00:00:19.650> lazy

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
might just say he's a little bit lazy

might just say he's a little bit lazy
and<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:20.400> can't<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.760> bothered<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and just really can't be bothered to

and just really can't be bothered to
shave<00:00:21.750> every<00:00:21.930> day<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.439> pick<00:00:22.769> maturity<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.789> a

shave every day I pick maturity I'm a
man<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.810> figured<00:00:25.650> I'd<00:00:25.710> grow<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> beard

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.269 

other<00:00:30.900> people<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.590> pick<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.099> scruffy

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
other people can just pick a bit scruffy

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
other people can just pick a bit scruffy
the<00:00:33.000> bigger<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.570> better

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the bigger the better

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799 
the bigger the better
but<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> mr.<00:00:35.640> Twitter<00:00:35.940> overblown<00:00:36.510> sort

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
but not in a mr. Twitter overblown sort

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.010 
but not in a mr. Twitter overblown sort
of<00:00:36.870> way<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.620> nicely<00:00:38.520> nicely<00:00:39.270> shaped<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
of way just a nicely nicely shaped one I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350 
of way just a nicely nicely shaped one I
think<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> nice<00:00:41.309> bloke<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
think he was a nice bloke probably if I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
think he was a nice bloke probably if I
saw<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.809> beard<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> man<00:00:44.270> all<00:00:45.270> very

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
saw a beard on a man all very

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
saw a beard on a man all very
interesting<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
interesting but what we really need is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
interesting but what we really need is
something<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.570> scientific<00:00:49.129> well

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
something a bit more scientific well

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
something a bit more scientific well

Julian Oldmeadow was written of report

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
called the psychology of beards

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.619 
called the psychology of beards
I<00:00:54.890> reviewed<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> psychological<00:00:56.879> research<00:00:57.059> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I reviewed the psychological research on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
I reviewed the psychological research on
the<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:58.980> beards<00:00:59.219> are

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the way that people with beards are

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.750 
the way that people with beards are
perceived<00:01:00.109> as<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> understand<00:01:02.100> what

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
perceived as a way to understand what

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
perceived as a way to understand what
perceptions<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.870> beards<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
perceptions we have of beards and and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
perceptions we have of beards and and
why<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> research<00:01:06.210> shows<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
why and what this research shows is that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
why and what this research shows is that
men<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.100> beards<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.640> perceived<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.299> more

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
men with beards are perceived to be more

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
men with beards are perceived to be more
masculine<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.409> dominant<00:01:10.860> than<00:01:10.979> people

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
masculine and more dominant than people

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
masculine and more dominant than people
without<00:01:11.610> beards<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.110> consistent

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
without beards and this is consistent

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
without beards and this is consistent
with<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> theory<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.310> beards<00:01:14.939> evolved<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
with the theory that beards evolved in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.230 
with the theory that beards evolved in
order<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.470> signal<00:01:17.070> dominance<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:17.939> males

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
order to signal dominance to other males

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
order to signal dominance to other males
and<00:01:18.659> therefore<00:01:19.259> give<00:01:19.470> men<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.890> beards<00:01:20.340> an

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and therefore give men with beards an

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.050 
and therefore give men with beards an
advantage<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.770> attracting<00:01:22.770> females<00:01:23.060> beards

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
advantage in attracting females beards

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
advantage in attracting females beards
also<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.439> man<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.729> less

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
also make a man look a little less

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.109 
also make a man look a little less
trustworthy<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.259> too<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.070> thick<00:01:29.880> beard

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
trustworthy so too much of a thick beard

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
trustworthy so too much of a thick beard
can<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.630> somebody<00:01:30.990> appear<00:01:31.320> less

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
can make somebody appear less

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.289 
can make somebody appear less
trustworthy<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.640> maybe<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.090> bit

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
trustworthy and maybe a little bit

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
trustworthy and maybe a little bit
shifty<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.259> far<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.530> attractiveness<00:01:35.040> goes<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
shifty as far as attractiveness goes and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.999 
shifty as far as attractiveness goes and
the<00:01:36.299> latest<00:01:36.600> research<00:01:36.810> suggests<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.740> women

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the latest research suggests that women

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
the latest research suggests that women
prefer<00:01:38.310> light<00:01:39.150> stubble<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> either

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
prefer light stubble to either

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.160 
prefer light stubble to either
clean-shaven<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.250> fully<00:01:41.729> bearded<00:01:42.150> men<00:01:42.329> but

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
clean-shaven or fully bearded men but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
clean-shaven or fully bearded men but
let's<00:01:43.380> face<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> bearded<00:01:44.670> man<00:01:44.729> really

most of your chingon when it comes to
