00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.330
 We can make you fat with excess 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.830
 of water and as we go by removing the

 if you are one of those who like to use 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.220
 the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.629
 this labels you have to have a bit of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.500
 be careful with that too 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:42.240
 okay 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.190
 [Music] 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.690

 you have to inflate a black balloon that 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.700
 I commented at the beginning to whom to expect what 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.370
 better what is molded to the cap 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.890
 this will serve so that it does not deform 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.720
 with the weight of the water you have, it's not going away 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.800
