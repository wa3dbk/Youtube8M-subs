00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
been in that line for I guess a while

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.269 
been in that line for I guess a while
now<00:00:24.210> actually<00:00:24.800> like<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.859> said<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
now actually like I said this is

Skellington<00:00:41.219> figures<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.850> guess<00:00:42.000> made<00:00:42.239> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
Skellington figures I guess made but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
Skellington figures I guess made but
they<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> tend<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> their

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
they all kind of tend to have their

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
they all kind of tend to have their
flaws<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.420> he's<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.710> easy<00:00:46.860> character<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
flaws but he's not an easy character to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
flaws but he's not an easy character to
capture<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:50.160> skinny

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
capture what with the this very skinny

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
capture what with the this very skinny
limbs<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> everything<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.649> it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
limbs and everything so you know it's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
limbs and everything so you know it's
kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> hard<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.370> guess<00:00:53.520> add<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
kind of hard I guess add the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
kind of hard I guess add the
articulation<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:55.320> keep<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
articulation and still keep it as a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.779 
articulation and still keep it as a
sturdy<00:00:56.520> figure<00:00:57.199> NECA<00:00:58.199> had<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:59.250> they've<00:00:59.760> had

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
sturdy figure NECA had well they've had

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.110 
sturdy figure NECA had well they've had
more<00:01:00.180> than<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> couple<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.930> attempts<00:01:01.260> with

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
more than a couple of attempts with

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.960 
more than a couple of attempts with
numerous<00:01:03.120> jack<00:01:03.390> figures<00:01:03.719> they've<00:01:03.930> made<00:01:04.700> but<00:01:05.700> I

of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> other<00:01:39.090> Jack's<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
of the other Jack's kind of all the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.039 
of the other Jack's kind of all the
lines<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.979> his<00:01:41.070> costume<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> painted

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
lines on his costume the it is painted

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.510 
lines on his costume the it is painted
but<00:01:43.200> they're<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.829> sculpted<00:01:44.399> as

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
but they're actually all sculpted as

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.630 
but they're actually all sculpted as
well<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.869> got<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> nice<00:01:46.290> 3d<00:01:47.159> look<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
well so it's got a nice 3d look to the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
well so it's got a nice 3d look to the
costume<00:01:48.060> rather<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> painted

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
costume rather than just the painted

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
costume rather than just the painted
lines<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.509> nicely<00:01:51.780> done<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lines so that's really nicely done and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230

as<00:02:02.200> well<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:04.050> all<00:02:05.050> around<00:02:05.409> they<00:02:05.560> sculpt<00:02:05.950> though

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
as well so all around they sculpt though

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.210 
as well so all around they sculpt though
I<00:02:06.630> really<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.590> kind<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.860> how<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.009> coat

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
I really like just kind of how the coat

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
I really like just kind of how the coat
looks<00:02:09.250> right<00:02:09.670> there<00:02:09.880> it's<00:02:10.750> need<00:02:10.990> effect<00:02:11.350> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
looks right there it's need effect it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.660 
looks right there it's need effect it
almost<00:02:11.709> actually<00:02:11.920> looks<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.550> can

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
almost actually looks like you can

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.110 
almost actually looks like you can
unbutton<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.800> head<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.160> done<00:02:15.340> well<00:02:15.580> he

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
unbutton it the head is done well he

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.270 
unbutton it the head is done well he
actually<00:02:16.270> includes<00:02:16.750> three<00:02:17.200> three<00:02:18.100> heads

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
actually includes three three heads

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.920 
actually includes three three heads
we'll<00:02:19.090> get<00:02:19.270> into<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.930> reviews<00:02:21.930> his

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
we'll get into that in the reviews his

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.310 
we'll get into that in the reviews his
hands<00:02:23.170> are<00:02:23.350> nicely<00:02:24.100> done<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.810> feet<00:02:26.050> are<00:02:26.170> kind

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
hands are nicely done the feet are kind

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.960 
hands are nicely done the feet are kind
of<00:02:26.500> plain<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:27.220> guess<00:02:27.489> there's<00:02:27.640> not<00:02:27.790> much

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
of plain but I guess there's not much

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.309 
of plain but I guess there's not much
they<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.900> kind<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> like

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
they can really do it's kind of like

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.880 
they can really do it's kind of like
that<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.800> figures<00:02:31.350> his<00:02:32.350> ankles<00:02:32.770> are

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that with all the figures his ankles are

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.460 
that with all the figures his ankles are
a<00:02:32.920> bulb<00:02:33.190> my<00:02:33.340> only<00:02:33.610> grape<00:02:33.820> with<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> figure<00:02:34.470> there

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
a bulb my only grape with a figure there

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.830 
a bulb my only grape with a figure there
I<00:02:35.800> don't<00:02:36.100> kind<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.209> stick<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.750> sore

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
I don't kind of stick out like a sore

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.820 
I don't kind of stick out like a sore
thumb<00:02:38.370> they're<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.519> terrible<00:02:40.090> at<00:02:40.239> all<00:02:40.330> but

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
thumb they're not terrible at all but

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.500 
thumb they're not terrible at all but
they<00:02:41.830> could<00:02:42.250> possibly<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.150> been<00:02:43.180> done<00:02:43.480> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
they could possibly have been done a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
they could possibly have been done a
little<00:02:43.720> better<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.739> actually<00:02:45.040> doesn't<00:02:45.160> look

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
little better it actually doesn't look

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.400 
little better it actually doesn't look
as<00:02:45.459> bad<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:45.970> one<00:02:46.209> but<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.780> think<00:02:46.840> maybe<00:02:47.290> I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
as bad on this one but I think maybe I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.280 
as bad on this one but I think maybe I
this<00:02:47.769> just<00:02:48.070> isn't<00:02:48.340> pushed<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.760> all<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:48.970> way

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
this just isn't pushed in all the way

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.900 
this just isn't pushed in all the way
which<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.800> know<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:50.980> might<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.459> try<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> fix

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
which I know I might have to try to fix

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.370 
which I know I might have to try to fix
but<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> definitely<00:02:52.750> looks<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.140> sticks

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
but it definitely looks like it sticks

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.380 
but it definitely looks like it sticks
out<00:02:53.500> farther<00:02:53.769> than<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> other<00:02:54.160> one<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:55.209> that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
out farther than the other one so that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.240 
out farther than the other one so that
might<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.810> an<00:02:55.900> easy<00:02:56.050> enough<00:02:56.350> fix<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:57.040> should

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
might be an easy enough fix it should

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.000 
might be an easy enough fix it should
kind<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.519> look<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.670> Revoltech<00:02:58.300> joints<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.470> a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
kind of look like Revoltech joints but a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.640 
kind of look like Revoltech joints but a
good<00:03:00.910> joint<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.600> kind<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.930> I'm<00:03:02.410> not<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
good joint they just kind of I'm not a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.280 
good joint they just kind of I'm not a
huge<00:03:03.040> fan<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.250> how<00:03:03.370> they<00:03:03.519> look

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
huge fan of how they look

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.979

he<00:04:01.330> has<00:04:01.450> he<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.349> kind<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.650> funny<00:04:03.010> bulging<00:04:03.519> at

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
he has he is kind of funny bulging at

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.059 
he has he is kind of funny bulging at
hips<00:04:04.019> they<00:04:05.019> can<00:04:05.170> actually<00:04:05.290> kind<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.739> swivel

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
hips they can actually kind of swivel

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.430 
hips they can actually kind of swivel
from<00:04:06.159> side<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.459> side<00:04:06.610> like<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.209> as<00:04:08.080> well<00:04:08.110> as

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
from side to side like that as well as

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.809 
from side to side like that as well as
around<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.769> guess<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:08.950> guess<00:04:09.370> they're<00:04:09.549> actually

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
around I guess I guess they're actually

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.000 
around I guess I guess they're actually
like<00:04:09.940> true<00:04:10.269> ball<00:04:10.450> joints<00:04:10.810> which<00:04:11.019> you<00:04:11.830> don't

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
like true ball joints which you don't

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.369 
like true ball joints which you don't
see<00:04:12.099> on<00:04:12.370> figures<00:04:12.670> very<00:04:12.909> often<00:04:13.330> usually<00:04:14.049> more

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
see on figures very often usually more

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.439 
see on figures very often usually more
like<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.530> ball<00:04:14.799> hinge<00:04:15.159> but<00:04:15.489> he<00:04:15.879> actually<00:04:16.150> has

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
like a ball hinge but he actually has

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.189 
like a ball hinge but he actually has
true<00:04:16.750> ball<00:04:16.930> jointed<00:04:17.370> hips<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.750> again<00:04:19.750> really

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
true ball jointed hips and again really

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.860 
true ball jointed hips and again really
nice<00:04:21.330> pin<00:04:22.330> at<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.870> knee<00:04:23.410> hinge

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
nice pin at the knee hinge

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.560 
nice pin at the knee hinge
nice<00:04:25.870> range<00:04:26.229> of<00:04:26.290> motion<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.180> said

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
nice range of motion and as I said

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210 
nice range of motion and as I said
earlier<00:04:28.870> he's<00:04:28.990> got<00:04:29.169> kind<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> revolve

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
earlier he's got kind of the revolve

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.610 
earlier he's got kind of the revolve
Peck<00:04:30.460> sort<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.760> ankles<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.240> they<00:04:31.840> can<00:04:32.080> swivel

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
Peck sort of ankles so they can swivel

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.219 
Peck sort of ankles so they can swivel
from<00:04:32.740> side<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.039> side<00:04:33.190> forward<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.150> back<00:04:34.240> if

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
from side to side forward and back if

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.719 
from side to side forward and back if
you<00:04:35.380> want<00:04:35.560> you<00:04:35.650> can<00:04:35.800> even<00:04:35.830> kind<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.250> swivel<00:04:36.639> the

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
you want you can even kind of swivel the

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.879 
you want you can even kind of swivel the
pin<00:04:36.940> around<00:04:37.060> at<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.510> top<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.020> then<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.740> this

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
pin around at the top and then have this

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.000 
pin around at the top and then have this
foot<00:04:39.160> Bend<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.000> from<00:04:40.210> side<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.510> side<00:04:41.010> it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
foot Bend like from side to side it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.990 
foot Bend like from side to side it
takes<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.340> bit<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.520> doing<00:04:43.090> but<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.870> possible

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
takes a bit of doing but it is possible

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.240 
takes a bit of doing but it is possible
so<00:04:46.320> really<00:04:47.320> nice<00:04:47.440> articulation<00:04:47.800> he's

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
so really nice articulation he's

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.400 
so really nice articulation he's
actually<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.639> think<00:04:48.729> slightly<00:04:49.570> less

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
actually I think slightly less

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.040 
actually I think slightly less
articulated<00:04:51.160> than<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.490> Necker<00:04:51.940> version<00:04:52.300> but

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
articulated than the Necker version but

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.080 
articulated than the Necker version but
I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.710> all<00:04:53.800> works<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.430> fair<00:04:54.760> bit<00:04:54.910> better

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
I think it all works a fair bit better

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.409 
I think it all works a fair bit better
on<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.479> figure<00:04:56.400> I'd<00:04:57.400> say<00:04:57.580> hey<00:04:57.760> stand<00:04:58.120> for<00:04:58.360> the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
on this figure I'd say hey stand for the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.570 
on this figure I'd say hey stand for the
most<00:04:58.600> part<00:04:58.840> is<00:04:58.930> necessary<00:04:59.440> what<00:05:00.400> with<00:05:00.550> a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
most part is necessary what with a

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.159 
most part is necessary what with a
little<00:05:01.090> tiny<00:05:01.300> feet<00:05:01.600> he<00:05:01.690> has<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.870> hard<00:05:02.110> time

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
little tiny feet he has a hard time

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.159 
little tiny feet he has a hard time
standing<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.090> just<00:05:04.270> want<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.510> quick<00:05:04.690> bring

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
standing so I just want to quick bring

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.250 
standing so I just want to quick bring
out<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.380> neck<00:05:05.560> oh<00:05:05.590> one<00:05:06.630> there's<00:05:07.630> not<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.840> huge

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
out the neck oh one there's not a huge

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.960 
out the neck oh one there's not a huge
difference<00:05:08.440> in<00:05:08.800> size<00:05:08.979> like<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:09.430> one<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.760> I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
difference in size like this one is I

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.320 
difference in size like this one is I
guess<00:05:10.210> noticeably<00:05:10.750> bigger<00:05:11.010> but<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:13.210> know

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
guess noticeably bigger but you know

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.940 
guess noticeably bigger but you know
that<00:05:13.539> the<00:05:13.720> neck<00:05:13.840> ones<00:05:14.110> actually<00:05:14.289> still<00:05:14.710> fairly

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
that the neck ones actually still fairly

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.480 
that the neck ones actually still fairly
tall<00:05:15.280> I'm<00:05:15.580> standing<00:05:16.210> next<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.510> him<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:17.130> but<00:05:18.130> you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
tall I'm standing next to him so but you

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.610 
tall I'm standing next to him so but you
can<00:05:18.639> just<00:05:18.820> see<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.270> all<00:05:19.450> around<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.410> is

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
can just see like all around this is

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.310 
can just see like all around this is
definitely<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.250> better<00:05:22.180> pick<00:05:22.539> he<00:05:22.720> retails

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
definitely the better pick he retails

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.779 
definitely the better pick he retails
for<00:05:23.440> about<00:05:23.560> double<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.099> price<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.610> one

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
for about double the price of this one

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.690 
for about double the price of this one
at<00:05:24.910> about<00:05:25.410> between<00:05:26.410> like<00:05:26.560> 35<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.280> 40<00:05:27.520> bucks

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
at about between like 35 and 40 bucks

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.089 
at about between like 35 and 40 bucks
for<00:05:28.330> this<00:05:28.450> version<00:05:28.690> I<00:05:29.050> picked<00:05:29.740> this<00:05:29.860> one<00:05:29.919> up

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
for this version I picked this one up

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.560 
for this version I picked this one up
for<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.430> boat<00:05:30.639> I<00:05:30.970> think<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.300> was<00:05:31.389> 16<00:05:33.570> that's

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
for a boat I think it was 16 that's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.490 
for a boat I think it was 16 that's
Canadian<00:05:34.960> dollars<00:05:35.620> by<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.800> way<00:05:36.660> so<00:05:37.660> yeah<00:05:38.320> this

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
Canadian dollars by the way so yeah this

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.020 
Canadian dollars by the way so yeah this
one<00:05:38.680> definitely<00:05:38.950> has<00:05:39.039> more<00:05:39.250> articulation<00:05:39.849> but

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
one definitely has more articulation but

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.570 
one definitely has more articulation but
I<00:05:40.539> really<00:05:41.289> don't<00:05:41.410> even<00:05:41.680> like<00:05:41.830> handling<00:05:42.460> this

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
I really don't even like handling this

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.980 
I really don't even like handling this
one<00:05:42.789> just<00:05:42.880> because<00:05:42.970> I'm<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:43.419> afraid<00:05:43.690> he's

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
one just because I'm so afraid he's

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.350 
one just because I'm so afraid he's
gonna<00:05:44.110> break<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.610> he's<00:05:45.610> actually<00:05:45.940> kind<00:05:46.270> of

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
gonna break and he's actually kind of

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.240 
gonna break and he's actually kind of
tricky<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.690> get<00:05:46.900> hold<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.169> now<00:05:47.320> so<00:05:47.590> I'd<00:05:48.099> rather

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
tricky to get hold of now so I'd rather

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.810 
tricky to get hold of now so I'd rather
not<00:05:48.460> have<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.729> replace<00:05:48.910> them<00:05:50.639> so

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
not have to replace them so

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.070 
not have to replace them so
via<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.229> accessories<00:05:56.060> he<00:05:57.060> did<00:05:57.240> include<00:05:57.690> a

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
via the accessories he did include a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.810 
via the accessories he did include a
couple<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.530> goodies<00:05:58.680> so<00:05:59.250> he<00:05:59.340> has<00:05:59.430> kind<00:05:59.639> of<00:05:59.729> a

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
couple of goodies so he has kind of a

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.510 
couple of goodies so he has kind of a
more<00:06:00.360> like<00:06:00.510> a<00:06:00.630> fearsome<00:06:01.080> looking<00:06:01.350> head<00:06:01.520> and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
more like a fearsome looking head and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.150 
more like a fearsome looking head and
like<00:06:02.639> he's<00:06:02.790> angry<00:06:03.210> or<00:06:03.360> yelling<00:06:03.660> or<00:06:03.750> something

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
like he's angry or yelling or something

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.760 
like he's angry or yelling or something
but<00:06:05.160> it's<00:06:05.580> really<00:06:05.820> nicely<00:06:06.090> done<00:06:06.419> has<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:06.870> nice

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.290 
but it's really nicely done has a nice
sculpt<00:06:08.570> and<00:06:09.570> then<00:06:10.470> he's<00:06:10.590> just<00:06:10.860> kind<00:06:11.040> of<00:06:11.100> a

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
sculpt and then he's just kind of a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.800 
sculpt and then he's just kind of a
plain<00:06:12.300> looking<00:06:12.600> face<00:06:13.490> again<00:06:14.490> which<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.880> kind

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
plain looking face again which is kind

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.640 
plain looking face again which is kind
of<00:06:15.870> what<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.110> one<00:06:16.290> had<00:06:17.330> so<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:18.720> then<00:06:19.050> like<00:06:19.530> I

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
of what this one had so and then like I

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.930 
of what this one had so and then like I
said<00:06:19.830> on<00:06:19.949> the<00:06:19.979> figure<00:06:20.280> he's<00:06:20.430> got<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.699> actual

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
said on the figure he's got the actual

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.350 
said on the figure he's got the actual
grinning<00:06:21.660> face<00:06:21.900> and<00:06:22.340> of<00:06:23.340> course<00:06:23.699> he<00:06:24.180> wouldn't

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
grinning face and of course he wouldn't

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.219 
grinning face and of course he wouldn't
be<00:06:24.479> complete<00:06:24.810> without<00:06:24.930> his<00:06:25.289> sidekick<00:06:25.860> zero<00:06:26.490> I

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
be complete without his sidekick zero I

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.740 
be complete without his sidekick zero I
was<00:06:28.229> just<00:06:28.380> kind<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.680> simple<00:06:28.919> accessory<00:06:29.370> but

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
was just kind of a simple accessory but

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.689 
was just kind of a simple accessory but
captures<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.870> character<00:06:31.199> well<00:06:31.490> he's<00:06:32.490> got

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
captures the character well he's got

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.189 
captures the character well he's got
like<00:06:32.820> a<00:06:32.880> little<00:06:33.090> swivel<00:06:33.330> at<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.630> neck<00:06:33.810> other

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
like a little swivel at the neck other

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.140 
like a little swivel at the neck other
than<00:06:34.350> that<00:06:34.440> he's<00:06:34.650> really<00:06:35.280> not<00:06:35.400> articulate<00:06:36.060> at

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
than that he's really not articulate at

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.320 
than that he's really not articulate at
all<00:06:37.220> the<00:06:38.220> inside<00:06:38.520> is<00:06:38.610> just<00:06:38.729> kind<00:06:38.910> of<00:06:38.940> rubbery

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
all the inside is just kind of rubbery

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.020 
all the inside is just kind of rubbery
so<00:06:40.289> what<00:06:40.919> I<00:06:40.949> mean<00:06:41.100> kind<00:06:41.250> of<00:06:41.340> nice<00:06:41.490> if<00:06:41.699> he<00:06:41.850> would

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
so what I mean kind of nice if he would

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.969 
so what I mean kind of nice if he would
have<00:06:42.090> included<00:06:42.840> maybe<00:06:43.199> like<00:06:43.380> a<00:06:43.410> little<00:06:43.680> clear

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
have included maybe like a little clear

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:44.810 
have included maybe like a little clear
stance<00:06:44.310> too

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
stance too

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.070 
stance too
and<00:06:45.210> I<00:06:45.270> make<00:06:45.419> it<00:06:45.510> look<00:06:45.570> like<00:06:45.780> he's<00:06:45.900> hovering

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
and I make it look like he's hovering

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.550 
and I make it look like he's hovering
side<00:06:46.500> Jack<00:06:47.270> but<00:06:48.270> it's<00:06:48.780> not<00:06:48.990> all<00:06:49.110> he's<00:06:49.260> got<00:06:49.410> kind

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
side Jack but it's not all he's got kind

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.080 
side Jack but it's not all he's got kind
of<00:06:49.620> the<00:06:49.740> 2-tone<00:06:50.160> there<00:06:50.400> and<00:06:50.729> almost<00:06:50.850> looks

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
of the 2-tone there and almost looks

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.640 
of the 2-tone there and almost looks
like<00:06:51.180> shadow<00:06:51.479> in<00:06:51.660> his<00:06:51.780> mouth<00:06:51.960> but<00:06:52.199> it's<00:06:52.380> just<00:06:52.470> a

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
like shadow in his mouth but it's just a
