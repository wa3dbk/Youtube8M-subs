first<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.289> all<00:00:35.379> we're<00:00:35.589> starting<00:00:36.010> off<00:00:36.159> with<00:00:36.190> the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
first of all we're starting off with the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.270 
first of all we're starting off with the
hardened<00:00:37.300> clay<00:00:37.420> now<00:00:38.050> as<00:00:38.379> always<00:00:38.620> I<00:00:38.980> always

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
hardened clay now as always I always

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.489 
hardened clay now as always I always
think<00:00:39.489> me<00:00:39.670> minecraft<00:00:40.329> bricks<00:00:40.749> are<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.019> bit<00:00:41.199> too

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
think me minecraft bricks are a bit too

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.739 
think me minecraft bricks are a bit too
red<00:00:41.890> so<00:00:42.399> I'm<00:00:42.519> I<00:00:42.640> told<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:43.089> texture<00:00:43.449> one<00:00:43.569> day

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
red so I'm I told that texture one day

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.299 
red so I'm I told that texture one day
but<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.050> moment<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:44.469> think<00:00:44.769> hardened<00:00:45.219> clay

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
but the moment I think hardened clay

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.430 
but the moment I think hardened clay
gets<00:00:45.699> a<00:00:45.760> really<00:00:45.999> nice<00:00:46.269> color<00:00:46.600> than<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.230> type

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
gets a really nice color than the type

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.380 
gets a really nice color than the type

the<00:01:37.680> stone<00:01:37.950> brick<00:01:38.310> you'd<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:39.000> seeing<00:01:39.210> quite<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the stone brick you'd be seeing quite a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090 
the stone brick you'd be seeing quite a
lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.440> annoyed<00:01:40.680> me<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
lot of this the thing I annoyed me it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.890 
lot of this the thing I annoyed me it
was<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.610> heart<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> clay<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.690> tree

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
was that a heart and clay out of tree

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.080 
was that a heart and clay out of tree
wood<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.440> see<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.220> can't<00:01:44.550> remove<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
wood we can see now I can't remove that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.580 
wood we can see now I can't remove that
and<00:01:45.420> place<00:01:45.720> another<00:01:45.960> block<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and place another block because the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
and place another block because the
wooden<00:01:46.860> slab<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.369> only<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.640> slab<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.150> therefore

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
wooden slab is only a slab and therefore

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.180 
wooden slab is only a slab and therefore
we<00:01:48.690> see<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.110> upper<00:01:49.380> block<00:01:49.500> from<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> outside

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
we see the upper block from the outside

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.770 
we see the upper block from the outside
she'll<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> keep<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.300> hardened<00:01:51.630> plate

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
she'll have to keep that hardened plate

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
she'll have to keep that hardened plate
layer<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.710> honest<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.160> isn't<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> big

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
layer but you're honest it isn't a big

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
layer but you're honest it isn't a big
pain<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.720> having<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.470> other

I'm gonna bring these arcs across now
and<00:02:09.989> spruce<00:02:10.410> worth<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.800> bit<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.459> did<00:02:11.489> in

our primary school you also be having a
chimney<00:02:14.790> let's<00:02:15.720> continue<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.410> bring<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
chimney let's continue to bring it

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.220 
chimney let's continue to bring it
across<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> turned<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:18.959> really

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
across like so it turned out really

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
across like so it turned out really
really<00:02:19.350> good<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.890> gave<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> nice<00:02:20.310> feel<00:02:20.550> of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
really good and gave a nice feel of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.060 
really good and gave a nice feel of
shape<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> build<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.320> also<00:02:22.470> prevented

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
shape to the build and it also prevented

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.740 
shape to the build and it also prevented
me<00:02:23.160> from<00:02:23.190> using<00:02:23.549> my<00:02:23.670> daylight<00:02:24.180> sensors<00:02:24.600> which

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
me from using my daylight sensors which

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.050 
me from using my daylight sensors which
I<00:02:24.900> tend<00:02:25.079> to<00:02:25.140> use<00:02:25.290> quite<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
I tend to use quite a lot you see you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.640 
I tend to use quite a lot you see you
add<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.480> more<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.900> window<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> side

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
add one more little window on the side

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.039 
add one more little window on the side
there<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> make<00:02:29.459> sure<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.030> roof<00:02:30.269> wasn't

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
there just to make sure the roof wasn't

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.800 
there just to make sure the roof wasn't

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
with the interior I sort of forgot to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.670 
with the interior I sort of forgot to
put<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> staircase<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:17.060> up<00:03:17.600> here<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.500> hey

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
put a staircase going up here but hey

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.170 
put a staircase going up here but hey
that's<00:03:18.860> no<00:03:19.100> biggie<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.910> not<00:03:20.000> gonna

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that's no biggie is it it's not gonna

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.630 
that's no biggie is it it's not gonna
affect<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.750> life<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.590> too<00:03:21.860> much<00:03:22.069> people<00:03:22.459> and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
affect the life but too much people and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640 
affect the life but too much people and
possibly<00:03:22.970> also<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.930> couldn't<00:03:24.170> use<00:03:24.260> piston

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
possibly also I couldn't use piston

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680 
possibly also I couldn't use piston
tables<00:03:25.010> because<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.489> same<00:03:26.060> brick<00:03:26.209> floor<00:03:26.480> was

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
tables because the same brick floor was

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.050 
tables because the same brick floor was
the<00:03:26.810> roof<00:03:27.049> for<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.530> floor<00:03:27.830> below<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the roof for the floor below so the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.470 
the roof for the floor below so the
Pistons<00:03:29.390> would<00:03:29.569> have<00:03:29.690> affected<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:31.480> that's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
Pistons would have affected that that's

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.300 
Pistons would have affected that that's
like<00:03:32.660> now<00:03:32.810> when<00:03:33.080> we<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.319> little<00:03:33.500> dock<00:03:33.830> area
