00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi guys, first football 2015 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.849
 first video to bring to you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.980
 news releases the latest came in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.759
 button and also launched a button 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.650
 tomatoes I think that here in Brazil you have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.990
 some brands that sells but there is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.590
 it is easier to hire 11 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.480
 and now some also arrived with eight 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 colors of eight I have four and before 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.009
 of show of all colors and maitê 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.700
 such events and sport, I'll just say more or 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.210
 less what I found is the product in 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.579
 I think it's a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.969
 good duration so it is for a liquid lipstick 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.579
 but in relation to the button and nick of mate 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.309
 it 's not so good so it's hard around 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 a couple of hours 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 I think the structural ones are much more 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 Daniks also lasted a little longer in 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 comparison to lipsticks imported in this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.369
 same style holder and of course it's good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.950
 saying ugly because others hard for 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.600
 much more time 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 but maturing here also the button 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 every three hours is what the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.880
 pigmentation is excellent and very 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 you pass a single layer and the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.520
 thing comes out just like every one in the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.780
 packing is not have to be thinking 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 several layers own a good color 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.150
 The lipstick is creamy for those who have the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.369
 lipstick so damicrosoft mate peak at 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.040
 daniks is a texture so a little 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.579
 similar I found a bit like 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.220
 they are the application is very easy you 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.490
 apply with the same brush 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 if you end up going wrong or leaving because 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.420
 out of contour 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 a clean swab that does not dry 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 quick who has imported lipsticks know 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.370
 What do you gotta get through this you hill? 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.530
 It's because you're going to have to come with 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.270
 you will have to see some 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.350
 more powerful thing will end up delivering 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 the skin you've already made 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 These are not you, you go. 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.370
 can do a very good control 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.650
 if you want to pass more layers do not 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.150
 will have kaká problem is that there 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 more lipsticks 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.340
 It is expensive so the imported ones have this 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.820
 The question of being silent said that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.660
 It was that and it's also the imported ones you 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.640
 can not make this move but it is 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.850
 so you are informed that sometimes you 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.910
 doting craze of making you not 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.300
 You can do this with lipstick light 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.580
 woe to that day even from the uac in the air 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.530
 where you will not be able either because 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.110
 do you stay with at least five 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.989
 very solid he wants all this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.600
 than the one that if you are taking 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.519
 Something about how he's going to leave. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.540
 but what I do not have is that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.540
 it is also the pigment of the finished product 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 getting on your lips you know if you 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.260
 is eating something it leaves with the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.630
 blog will get stained had an agreement 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.110
 with youtube and in my case I think 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.750
 very good that did not go all out 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.310
 button is that soft but 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.100
 values depends very much on the time of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.120
 How do you apply in the range of 15 to 25 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.660
 real 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.470
 That's more or less the value of stores. 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.730
 so it is known that people 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.010
 You will know that there will be no problem in 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.079
 delivery I know it has the mall stores 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.660
 beautiful that is selling oil shades and colors 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.049
 also they are super reliable store 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 they are already living with them and 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.300
 colors of the color chart I found 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.000
 they were very happy 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 Yes they did eight or even 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.550
 please everyone from the brick 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.920
 I'm pink the little face the reds on 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.550
 a darker color 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.550
 then it has for all tastes and it is so 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.519
 here is the putin logo that 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:22.160
 everybody knows that butterfly 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:26.090
 here also comes the name of the lipstick with the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.630
 name of the multi and also ask that I 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.480
 I think it's very good here. 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.610
 presure product validity then it is a 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.640
 thing that I think is important to have direct 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.700
 here and sometimes you have a company that 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.380
 in that plastic that comes from 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.130
 product things like this 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.190
 the agreement being one is that it then takes no 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.820
 so rosy design is not that it 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:57.080
 Had not then erased you now? 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.840
 woke up 02 which is also a nude tone 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.919
 only he has a background like this 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.440
 oranges 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:09.380
 I'm here with him on the lips to give 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.590
 you will also see pm in this edition in 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.550
 performance but a bit different from the 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.260
 other 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.470
 the third I wanna show 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.520
 You 're number four and everyone's mine. 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.620
 preferred 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.510
 He's handsome, I think he's one of those who 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.180
 more successful because today it is 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.220
 super trendy and it's a really cool thing 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.360
 I think it's what suits all 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.610
 skin tones 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.600
 who is very light in bright white will 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.130
 look beautiful 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:41.250
 beautiful and I think it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.970
 I'm not much of purple lipstick has some 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.850
 They like them, the darker they do not know 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.590
 The one that enchanted me is beautiful as 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.290
 I'm sure I'll use a lot of what I put 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.730
 for you see is that such the first 01 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:02.640
 02 04 and I'll show you the next one next to 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:07.350
 You guys, a red is not even 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:12.390
 The last I have is 11 07 super 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:15.090
 red red well open hung 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.060
 to put a shade of red that I think 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.130
 yes that combines more with the summer and so 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.650
 to overcome some people do not like button 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.100
 You will not like this thing, will you? 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.710
 here o 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.800
 You see from the four I have with 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.410
 the darker two are the most opaque 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.020
 these ones hold a little more of the 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.110
 that these two thus leaving to my 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.320
 Final Thoughts the lipsticks is like me 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.600
 I said before the darkest ones I found 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.620
 are more opaque than the two most 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.340
 clear 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:55.380
 they are even more chatinhos not melted 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:58.530
 that it is difficult to remove this coxinha 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.950
 here and yes at night train water withdrawal 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.140
 for a little while but it pepper more and stay 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.500
 more string is even more striking 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.260
 So touch those two lighter than me. 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:19.650
 I'll get better 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:23.130
 it comes out purple and pepper more but so it is 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.590
 in color it really gives the boys that 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:29.790
 becomes more dangerous and becomes more macho 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.070
 same but they are excellent lipsticks I think 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.580
 what for who like 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.100
 more sequins are great they are 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.570
 if we do not get textured in the 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.120
 lips is a texture if very 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.730
 comfortable is not anything chatinho ever 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.760
 sticky ks cadu 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.950
 I think they are very good I think it will 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.400
 be one of the 14 so the staff will 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.010
 It's ok, I really liked it 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.750

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.670
