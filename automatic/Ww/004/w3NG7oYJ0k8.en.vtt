 x that tree timer 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 this one took a while 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.880
 we have just as many waiting here too 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.780

 can be realized 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.960
 spirit signs timer comes in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.930
 a stylish box 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 he of course the computer itself 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.019
 an interface is also included 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.250
 which ensures that computer 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.579
 can be charged 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.649
 with a european plug and the interface 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.890
 10 also to the door computer with a

 about 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 oled color screen and the beautiful thing is that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.360
 The is the bourne little more capable 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 sets to set your own colors 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 blow up trade that the colors and the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.850
 screen is very sharp and therefore good too 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.480
 see is under water under dark 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
 circumstances 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 the house is made of politics though and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 therefore very robust 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.159
 The shape timer is suitable for up to 200 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.630
 meter depth 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.670
 the buttons on the side set you up 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 able to scroll through the menus 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 and options to select the supplied 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.619
 strip is long enough for one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 dry suit a debate trip from samsung and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 Our experience lasts from 3 to 4 pm 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 is that after three days and two weeks 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 wait the battery level of 100% hair 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 70% is to charge the computers to the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.469
 sea ​​side via the interface which 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.179
 included 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.750
 tips that form time is sometimes a bit tricky 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.950
 turn on 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.710
 I would normally be with two 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.219
 buttons have to but my how often 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 so 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.429
 so that it certainly concerns when I do 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.859
 if you have been out for a while it is 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.719
 sometimes difficult to get 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.850
 when the water goes in jump too hot 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.039
 timer in that mode to approximately 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.709
 one and a half meters depth and also the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.179
 computer on when it gets wet 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.920
 if you want the menu to the far 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.929
 you will have to hold the left button 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.019
 and then you can choose between logbook and 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.180
 settings we go to 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.579
 log and you hold down the right 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.940
 button when this content belongs to you 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.620
 actually deeper the menu in the diver 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.799
 oh those made to be ranked per 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.799
 date and not per dive 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.690
 when you click on a date then you will 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.049
 see if you have more than me per day 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.489
 have made of fun 1 2 3 or 4 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.280
 this is actually something else like us 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.410
 are accustomed to other dive computers 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 when the deeper goes then its here 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.590
 read all data and when the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.510
 right button you can continue and 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 view graphs such as 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.579
 the graph for your dead profile 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.319
 all this data can be on your normal 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.680
 desktop computer with the help of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.030
 of the interface and a tip 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.130
 I normally have it that way 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 set that after 30 seconds he again 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.130
 from the log how is this going in the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.620
 change settings to a longer time 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.000
 were sure to join this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.260
 otherwise you have to be able to go very fast 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.989
 write 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.579
 when we go out the minute you can 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.169
 back with the left button or when you 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.400
 both buttons equally content you go again 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.739
 back to the home screen 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 next to the log you can put in the in the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.620
 set the settings in the main menu 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.780
 then we go through the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.430
 lick button again to hold right to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.859
 scroll down and right 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 equally stuck here in the settings 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.450
 menu and here is basically everything in it 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.040
 set the bottom timer first 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.540
 Unfortunately there is no language in Dutch 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.829
 but German French Polish and English 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.500
 when we are going to come down 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.930
 the units you can set this here 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.780
 and paste whether your degrees or are ideal or 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.330
 that your feet or meters want the date and the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.040
 time the various alarms 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.950
 for example for depth or for you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.170
 dive time beautiful of this something deep is that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.230
 when an alarm goes off 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.380
 the entire screen turns red the us in you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.990
 suitcase is meant to you 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.100
 took off quickly and I suggest 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.950
 You put one in when you want one 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.360
 alarm goes off at display q for example 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.970
 the different colors 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.950
 adjust for the view screen 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.400
 is the different options too 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.739
 organize 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.700
 do you want your compass first or first 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.190
 the one here 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 see which profile during your death 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.940
 usability 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.260
 you can set how long it takes 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.340
 before you get thrown out of the minute 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.630
 you can do all kinds of my logbook settings 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.410
 different settings for you 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.260
 log 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.780
 drop in compass can you 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.060
 calibrate compass and 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.380
 View my system and can 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.690
 for example whole computer again 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.790
 reset when goes under water with the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.680
 is that tree timer you will see it 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.200
 screen looks just like it does now 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.870
 we just put it in demo mode 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.050
 the top yellow numbers are you 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.669
 current dead time the green digits to 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.610
 below is your current one 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.620
 depth and below you can see what you like 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.900
 average depth and what your maximum 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.580
 depth has been on the left 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.290
 you go up and you descend 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.390
 speed to see this is both met 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.860
 numbers as a graphic 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.930
 and if you go too fast will also learn one 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.390
 audio alarm 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.150
 at the top you can see your battery 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.060
 see how much wider is when 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.610
 you press the left button you go immediately 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.080
 to your dead profile normally 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.910
 if you press the left button again 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.680
 do you end up in your compass 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.240
 however, in demo mode this is not 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.740
 possible 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.050
 the once deep is pretty true with later 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.669
 two updates one for one that trucks 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.330
 the computer and once for a trimix 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.330
 the computer 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.160
 which is supplied with the x die 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.650
 plates timer is a bit loose 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.690
 and how limp we recommend the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.159
 dots beko 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.039
 in addition, a quick star is missing 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.720
 manual and turning on 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.520
 especially when the computer is out for a little longer 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.960
 sometimes can be difficult 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.949
 We think that's because I'm on it 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.159
 more than you have to do all over again 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.159
 boot up 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.250
 The bottom timer has a clear display 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.440
 you which is also easy to read 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.629
 in the dark or in bad 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.590
 water conditions in addition is the 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.680
 operation with the two buttons 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.659
 easy and innovative interface 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.220
 clouds lakes lions is is easy 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.870
 to connect to your computer 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.539
 And the great thing is that through the mail from it 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.169
 puppy the warmth and me can grow with it 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.169
 your needs 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.659
 when you are looking for one 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.979
 robust living time and then the x is the one 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.659
 definitely worth considering 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.389
 he can do just a little more than the average 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.759
 man a timer and also for the ordinary 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.860
 diver is the x which is a good choice because 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.120
 this with the first update a full 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.120
 and not trucks is computer
