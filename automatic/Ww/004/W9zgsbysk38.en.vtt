here<00:01:27.280> I'm<00:01:27.370> getting<00:01:27.490> these<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.970> play<00:01:28.210> books<00:01:28.420> for

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
here I'm getting these to play books for

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170 
here I'm getting these to play books for
a<00:01:28.900> hundred<00:01:29.290> coins<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.820> offensive<00:01:30.820> play<00:01:31.000> books

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
a hundred coins and offensive play books

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.500 
a hundred coins and offensive play books
or<00:01:31.360> probably<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.400> harder<00:01:33.400> wants<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.730> get<00:01:33.880> but

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
or probably the harder wants to get but

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.270 
or probably the harder wants to get but
defensive<00:01:35.500> play<00:01:35.650> books<00:01:35.830> are<00:01:35.920> obviously

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
defensive play books are obviously

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.100 
defensive play books are obviously
easier<00:01:36.700> but<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:36.940> think<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.360> collection<00:01:37.630> itself

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
easier but I think the collection itself

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.360 
easier but I think the collection itself
is<00:01:38.230> more<00:01:38.380> expensive<00:01:38.680> because<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.100> can<00:01:39.250> get

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
is more expensive because I can get

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.710 
is more expensive because I can get
every<00:01:39.640> single<00:01:39.790> defensive<00:01:40.360> play<00:01:40.540> book<00:01:40.690> for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
every single defensive play book for

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.200 
every single defensive play book for
about<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.080> hundred<00:01:41.260> coins<00:01:41.590> or<00:01:42.070> like<00:01:42.970> or<00:01:43.180> a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
about a hundred coins or like or a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.420 
about a hundred coins or like or a
little<00:01:43.480> more<00:01:43.510> but<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.170> Seahawks<00:01:44.740> playbook

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
little more but the Seahawks playbook

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.340 
little more but the Seahawks playbook
