 if you are an active user of facebook 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
 sure they often receive 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.290
 notifications to try different 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820
 games like the farm or candy crush and 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.350
 they all come to your panel 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.270
 notifications through the small 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 facebook balls and you're going 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.950
 jumping to invite you to try that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 game today we're going to show you how to remove 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.360
 these notifications to prevent you from 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 are constantly inviting you to try 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.590
 the games there is a very simple way that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.480
 it's just going to the notification 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.980
 that has arrived 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 we see pricking the ball of the world let's go 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.190
 to the notification and right next 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.650
 we have two symbols the first one would be 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 mark as read simply makes 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.450
 no longer do not appear blue and we can 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.220
 disable that notification so it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 it returns to appear but what happens that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.520
 that's just deactivating that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.040
 specific notification about that game 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.990
 and about that person in particular I 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.660
 I want to deactivate it whenever 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.180
 never invite me to play games like this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.259
 that today we are going to teach him how to do it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.519
 you just have to go to the panel 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.060
 configuration of your profile 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.920
 Facebook 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.290
 you go to the top corner nut 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.240
 straight 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 and click on settings 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 we are already in the configuration panel 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.870
 of you can go changing the different 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.270
 aspects of your account and we go inside 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.920
 of them blockages we see in the column of 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.930
 the left click on blocks 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.479
 within the blockade we have different 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.299
 ways of making people not 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.380
 invade our privacy and in this case 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.450
 let's see how to do it with 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 applications if you set the last of 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.670
 the options says block applications 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.500
 from here we can put names of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.049
 concrete applications that we want that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.680
 no longer notify us, for example, 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.970
 we can start writing candy crush and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.399
 we press candy crush we see how now 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 same candy crush saga is unlocked 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.539

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.350

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.569

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.590

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.260
 any other that you can think of then 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220
