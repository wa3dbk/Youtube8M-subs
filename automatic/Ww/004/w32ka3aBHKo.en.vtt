00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.760
 beautiful building open and central 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.180

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.690
 the central station also has one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 had the downside had rinsed there earlier 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.510
 a central station and it has to 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.970
 give way 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.410
 it was not just central station 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.660

 especially designed station buildings and the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.980
 In recent decades, most of them are 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.500
 are beautiful creations 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 fallen prey to the demolition hammer 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.530
 at the same time the municipality is rotterdam 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 very aware of her 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.219
 cultural-historical heritage and it shows 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.739
