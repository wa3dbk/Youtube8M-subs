00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.819
 As I had promised a towel I will teach you 100 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.230
 pending with 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.619
 digital apf use the back 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.369
 to make all kinds of costume jewelery 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.280
 commented that they have a card of this kind of things 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.810
 darkness in protest 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.210
 if you have the white house 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.269
 would be the first thing would be to empty the sr I do it with a knife pregÃ³n better with 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.069
 scissors cuts very well is different 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.520
 the naval ones the ecais 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.650
 and then it's just crushing it 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.690
 I stayed the longest possible you see there 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160
 of all colors and country 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.030
 many arrivals 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.640
 me in this case 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.749
 2 and by crushing under simply 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.350
 Canary Islands and 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 or sideways 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.360
 I use it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 for this type of cars 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080
 for example 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.080
 today they crush to feel that you are 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.930
 then to make them outstanding 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.050
 Well, several titles simply respond 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.510
 would be to paste 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.190
 one behind the other 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 make it here the little hole 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.860
 and with 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 and with him in Iran is still pending and that you have a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.190
 in this case I think that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.390
 And because of that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.780
 that would be to put the curved capsule 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.140
 and from the back he reads from ccoo 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.500
 it paints a surplus when it is dry 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 hit him balls 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.540
 this month one of the few groups ask for more simple 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 in front they stay and like that and inside they have two little balls 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.570
 I did not want to teach more modern 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.460
 like these as it is from behind I have the prick silver years 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.940
 without anything 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.200
 and ahead lpr 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 These case drawings are made with ripoff 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 that in this case I buy the dyn bars on ebay 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 If what you are looking for is little hello we did and that is sure in this case the bars and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.999
 They are normally used to give 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.609
 Lucky 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.609
 but today you see that separates them for the earrings 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.549
 is simply to cut it with the finite committee 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.419
 and put the slice to hit the red yes no 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.749
 on the Canary slopes 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 you see that almost instantly 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.599
 also several political models not even that the previous ones did not have 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.339
 land to these he put a living stone 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.689
 is that behind this leave us you can see what you have 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 august dean 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.599
 by then you know very easy yes I do if you want to make some video 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.810
 more extensive explaining the process well done 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.510
