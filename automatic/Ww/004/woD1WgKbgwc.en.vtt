00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
make an amplifier that we believe is

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.790 
make an amplifier that we believe is

Elvis and the Tupelo which are both very

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.940 
Elvis and the Tupelo which are both very
unique<00:02:34.390> designs<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.079> came<00:02:35.320> from<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.680> lost

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
unique designs that came from a lost

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.860 
unique designs that came from a lost
prototype<00:02:36.549> from<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> 60s<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.540> had<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
prototype from the 60s that we had the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.770 
prototype from the 60s that we had the
good<00:02:38.079> fortune<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.590> coming<00:02:38.620> across<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:40.060> they're

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
good fortune of coming across so they're

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.720 
good fortune of coming across so they're
similar<00:02:41.530> amps<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.579> same

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
similar amps in that they have the same

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.520 
similar amps in that they have the same
functionality<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:43.540> different<00:02:44.049> circuits<00:02:44.410> and

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
functionality but different circuits and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.740 
functionality but different circuits and
different<00:02:44.829> transformers<00:02:45.519> that's<00:02:46.510> very

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
different transformers that's very

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
different transformers that's very
unique<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.230> very<00:02:47.290> fun<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> big<00:02:48.370> amp<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.850> a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
unique and very fun it's a big amp and a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.120 
unique and very fun it's a big amp and a
small<00:02:49.180> package<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.560> move<00:02:50.739> up<00:02:50.919> through

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
small package then you move up through

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.430 
small package then you move up through
the<00:02:51.250> blue<00:02:51.400> line<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.820> see<00:02:52.030> our<00:02:52.180> Empire<00:02:52.660> which

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
you're a British amp guy then you move

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.520 
you're a British amp guy then you move
on<00:03:01.240> up<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.420> our<00:03:01.630> producer<00:03:02.110> which<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.410> our

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
on up to our producer which is our

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.559 
on up to our producer which is our
top-of-the-line<00:03:02.800> amp<00:03:03.490> which<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> first

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
top-of-the-line amp which is the first

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.600 
top-of-the-line amp which is the first
one<00:03:04.750> we've<00:03:04.930> done<00:03:05.140> what<00:03:05.350> we<00:03:05.740> call<00:03:05.980> high<00:03:06.220> current

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
one we've done what we call high current

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.330 
one we've done what we call high current
low<00:03:06.670> voltage<00:03:07.240> so<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.110> tubes<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.530> running

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
low voltage so the tubes are running

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.610 
low voltage so the tubes are running
very<00:03:09.700> comfortably<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.569> very<00:03:11.020> well<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:11.440> so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
very comfortably and very well but so

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.650 
very comfortably and very well but so
they'll<00:03:11.770> live<00:03:12.010> for<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.310> long<00:03:12.520> time<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.510> show

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
they'll live for a long time and show

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.170 
they'll live for a long time and show
astonishing<00:03:14.470> functionality<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:15.910> do<00:03:16.060> the
