00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.420
 hi how about i am luis this is magical 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.430
 Tours welcome long ago 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.220
 I presented a routine that I liked 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.529
 much in particular the truth 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.740
 It seemed like a nice routine 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.350
 transform letters that is here by 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.630
 please go to this link if you remember the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.080
 name maybe you already saw it but 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.900
 go make sure you have seen this 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.920
 I hope you like it if you have not seen it and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.040
 we bring the first part of that trick 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.750
 revealed here then I hope they 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.820
 like this video is a revelation 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.820
 and then I leave them there 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 very well presents the effect 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 quickly to then move on to the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.309
 revelation we give you to choose a letter 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.670
 the viewer 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.040
 let's say you choose the 4 of spades and you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.190
 We ask that you place it here on the top of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.810
 the deck we're going to cut to lose the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.250
 letter let's cut well cutting 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.549
 is well lost we can even 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.549
 Mix 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 and so it's completely lost its 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.340
 load 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.360
 let's see what the letter is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.680
 here in top 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.670
 is the ace of hearts and then we are going to 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.250
 take it and let's go through 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.720
 our deck 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.490
 magic and once it crosses it transforms 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 in our letter 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.310
 this is the effect we are going to the revelation 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.220
 very well the revelation 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.080
 we have already done something similar on my channel 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.660
 manipulations like that let's 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 leave the viewer's letter here about 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.300
 the deck we are going to cut approximately 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.650
 a third of the deck this way of 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.730
 cut 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.790
 we take as a pincer with short or with the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 middle finger and with the thumb like that on the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.390
 short songs of the deck and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.269
 we separate a piece to the side if the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.269
 we can move it with the thumb 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.040
 as pivot then we take this third 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.860
 of the deck we remember that here is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.390
 our choice and 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.840
 and we drop but leaving a 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 break of pinkie and little finger is there 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.080
 put such is a little less a little more 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.840
 and the truth is quite disguised 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.730
 front you practically can not see 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.599
 and we are going to make this cut that is to go 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.849
 dropping the deck to pieces 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.190
 then we drop like a third 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.989
 part of the deck maybe a little less 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.700
 in this case it was a quarter 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.110
 then I will drop another one 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 fourth part as well and for the next or 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 be at some point we drop from 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.140
 the break 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 I do not know how to make this look 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.450
 ok but it's something like that from the break 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.070
 here at this moment there is only my 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.190
 thumb and my index stopping the deck 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.740
 then naturally it falls from the break 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.280
 and we continue 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.080
 then we have the address here 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 of the viewer so we let that 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.780
 complete this piece and we complete 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.550
 we show it here is the cut is 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.610
 relatively simple what can 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.340
 practice first without breaking and leaving him 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.640
 fall to pieces the thumb goes like that 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.550
 traveling to drop a piece 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.440
 and we turn it on, we just push it 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.069
 go another little to drop a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.150
 little more and we push it 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.660
 and we push it ok very well once 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.419
 we control the letter again here we go 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.900
 to perform a double lift or double 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:28.669
 lift consisting of two letters 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.419
 take us to the hand 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.820
 ok then instead of just one we take 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.110
 two we show as if this were the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.650
 letter from above we return it and we are going to 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.340
 take this time only one if we do it from 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.180
 this way like taking a 2 that is 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.090
 a pretty simple way 1 2 and we what 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.150
 we carry 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.870
 and also if we can bend a bit, it's not 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.030
 see that there are two letters 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.500
 we do it in the same way if we 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.449
 we do so we do it the same 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.930
 way later to take a single 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.490
 in this way it disguises very well that 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.139
 we are doing a double lifting 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.220
 I'm going to change the letter here because it 's 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.960
 the other 4 black 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.260
 but the way that I just 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.720
 do is 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.720
 I just grab 12 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.230
 extends the letters a little like that so 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.470
 be easier and I grab 1 2 and I squeeze 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.870
 so that it looks like a single letter flipped 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.639
 I show them as if it were the letter of 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.939
 up the return 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.810
 and I repeat the movement but this time 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.810
 he just raised one 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.080
 and it will already be the letter that the 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.400
 viewer we just do it 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.360
 go through because it's a nice game and it 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.270
 transformed 7 diamonds on 4 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.920
 picas to conclude we can make a 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.260
 cut either with one hand or with two then 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.560
 so that the letter they had seen the 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.370
 viewer is not up to the top that's 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.260
 all 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.210
 in the first manipulation that 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.750
 we made in this video yes no 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.730
 but again 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.720
 and I hope you liked to see you 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.720
 The following bye
