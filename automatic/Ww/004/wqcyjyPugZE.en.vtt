00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
just type of training Doug gave me a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.610 
just type of training Doug gave me a
more<00:00:47.240> code<00:00:47.420> or<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.630> know<00:00:47.900> I<00:00:48.110> came<00:00:48.290> up<00:00:48.410> with<00:00:48.440> this

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
more code or I know I came up with this

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.270 
more code or I know I came up with this
idea<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.130> hey<00:00:49.280> let<00:00:49.520> me<00:00:50.770> train<00:00:51.800> let<00:00:52.160> me

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
idea that hey let me train let me

ranges<00:00:54.440> five<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.980> eight<00:00:55.130> reps<00:00:55.400> for<00:00:56.060> about<00:00:56.270> four

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
ranges five to eight reps for about four

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.690 
ranges five to eight reps for about four
weeks<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.079> move<00:00:57.680> on<00:00:57.860> with<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.250> same<00:00:58.489> way

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
weeks and then move on with the same way

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.160 
weeks and then move on with the same way
that<00:00:58.910> I'm<00:00:59.030> used<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.210> five<00:00:59.450> to<00:00:59.540> eight<00:00:59.690> reps<00:00:59.900> try

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that I'm used to five to eight reps try

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.840 
that I'm used to five to eight reps try
to<00:01:00.230> get<00:01:00.440> stronger<00:01:00.710> used<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.100> way<00:01:01.310> for<00:01:01.520> ten<00:01:01.700> to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
to get stronger used that way for ten to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.280 
to get stronger used that way for ten to
twelve<00:01:02.030> reps<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.480> next<00:01:02.720> four<00:01:02.870> weeks<00:01:02.899> and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
twelve reps in the next four weeks and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.289 
twelve reps in the next four weeks and
then<00:01:03.350> after<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.460> try<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.729> use<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.059> same

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
then after that I try to use that same

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.180 
then after that I try to use that same
way<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:05.659> fifteen<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.020> twenty<00:01:06.049> reps<00:01:06.470> this<00:01:06.950> way

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
way for fifteen to twenty reps this way

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.410 
way for fifteen to twenty reps this way
I've<00:01:07.340> used<00:01:07.370> in<00:01:07.670> one<00:01:07.820> way<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.000> I'm<00:01:08.180> getting

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
I've used in one way and I'm getting

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.200 
I've used in one way and I'm getting
progressively<00:01:08.570> stronger<00:01:09.430> with<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.970> also

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
progressively stronger with it and also

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.420 
progressively stronger with it and also
I<00:01:11.330> get<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.540> experiment<00:01:11.690> different<00:01:12.070> rep<00:01:13.070> ranges

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
I get to experiment different rep ranges

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.750 
I get to experiment different rep ranges
and<00:01:13.610> by<00:01:14.330> accident<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.229> know<00:01:15.490> stumbled<00:01:16.490> you

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
and by accident you know stumbled you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.070 
and by accident you know stumbled you
know<00:01:16.880> upon<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:17.360> thing<00:01:17.510> I<00:01:17.600> realized<00:01:17.960> that

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
know upon this thing I realized that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.380 
know upon this thing I realized that
when<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.260> was<00:01:18.440> doing<00:01:18.560> uh<00:01:18.830> 15<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:19.610> 20<00:01:19.850> range<00:01:19.970> is

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
when I was doing uh 15 to 20 range is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.600 
when I was doing uh 15 to 20 range is
some<00:01:21.049> muscles<00:01:21.500> remain<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.950> same<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.400> didn't

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
some muscles remain the same and didn't

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.430 
some muscles remain the same and didn't
even<00:01:22.700> budge<00:01:23.060> after<00:01:23.479> four<00:01:23.630> weeks<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.049> know<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
even budge after four weeks you know and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.020 
even budge after four weeks you know and
some<00:01:25.159> people<00:01:25.190> say<00:01:25.430> what<00:01:25.549> forward<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.909> not

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
some people say what forward is not

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.399 
some people say what forward is not
enough<00:01:26.270> force<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:26.630> enough<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.990> see<00:01:27.110> changes

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
enough force is enough to see changes

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.390 
enough force is enough to see changes

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
fifteen and twenty rep range I noticed a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.039 
fifteen and twenty rep range I noticed a
lot<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.890> different<00:01:37.400> muscles<00:01:37.820> were<00:01:38.570> growing<00:01:38.960> a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
lot of different muscles were growing a

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.690 
lot of different muscles were growing a
lot<00:01:39.260> faster<00:01:39.740> than<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.950> rest<00:01:40.100> some<00:01:40.400> would<00:01:40.580> like

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
lot faster than the rest some would like

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.039 
lot faster than the rest some would like
not<00:01:40.880> moving<00:01:41.150> at<00:01:41.270> all<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.450> some<00:01:41.750> even<00:01:41.930> got

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
not moving at all and some even got

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.380 
not moving at all and some even got
smaller<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.680> some<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.700> blew<00:01:43.940> up

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
smaller and some just blew up

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.420 
smaller and some just blew up
now<00:01:45.020> stinky<00:01:45.350> damn<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.920> know<00:01:46.040> what's<00:01:46.280> there

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
now stinky damn you know what's there

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.130 
now stinky damn you know what's there
for<00:01:46.460> like<00:01:46.820> I'm<00:01:46.939> doing<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.240> same<00:01:47.420> thing<00:01:47.659> I've

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.429 
always been the one don't mean I change
the<00:01:49.520> rep<00:01:49.670> ranges<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.570> anyway<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.049> number<00:01:51.260> one

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
the rep ranges but anyway the number one

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.289 
the rep ranges but anyway the number one
I<00:01:51.590> moved<00:01:51.979> on<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> FAFSA<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.640> web<00:01:52.939> branch<00:01:53.150> you

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
I moved on to the FAFSA a web branch you

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.550 
I moved on to the FAFSA a web branch you
know<00:01:53.390> cuz<00:01:53.540> it's<00:01:53.689> a<00:01:53.750> cycle<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.200> up<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.409> eight

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
know cuz it's a cycle for up to eight

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.679 
know cuz it's a cycle for up to eight
but<00:01:54.890> moving<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> five<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> eight<00:01:56.540> which

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
but moving on to the five to eight which

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.870 
but moving on to the five to eight which
is<00:01:56.840> heavy<00:01:57.110> power<00:01:57.650> you<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.340> explosive

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
years like before I didn't nine ten

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.289 
years like before I didn't nine ten
months<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.829> started<00:02:35.730> my<00:02:35.849> book<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.269> I

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
months when I started my book but I

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.309 
months when I started my book but I
never<00:02:36.569> pay<00:02:36.690> attention<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.230> I

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
never pay attention to it and I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.830 
never pay attention to it and I
remembered<00:02:37.650> wow<00:02:37.829> it's<00:02:38.579> true<00:02:38.849> slow<00:02:39.599> twitch

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
remembered wow it's true slow twitch

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600 
remembered wow it's true slow twitch
muscle<00:02:40.170> fibers<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.769> endurance<00:02:41.190> muscles

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
muscle fibers are you endurance muscles

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.089 
muscle fibers are you endurance muscles
and<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:41.909> required<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> lot<00:02:42.450> more<00:02:42.629> volume<00:02:43.099> in

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
and they required a lot more volume in

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.339 
and they required a lot more volume in
order<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.549> fatigued<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.810> grow<00:02:46.079> as

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
order to be fatigued and to grow as

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.500 
order to be fatigued and to grow as
opposed<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.099> fast<00:02:47.459> twitch<00:02:47.670> muscle<00:02:48.030> fibers<00:02:48.329> who

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
opposed to fast twitch muscle fibers who

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.030 
opposed to fast twitch muscle fibers who
need<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.079> know<00:02:49.200> power<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.680> intensity

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
need just you know power and intensity

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.380 
need just you know power and intensity
and<00:02:50.129> things<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:50.970> also<00:02:51.150> fun

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and things like that it's also fun

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.900 
and things like that it's also fun

should about I was just doing 3 sets of
10<00:04:04.650> 3<00:04:04.889> sets<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.160> 10<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.030> realizing<00:04:06.329> I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
10 3 sets of 10 and I was realizing I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.030 
10 3 sets of 10 and I was realizing I
was<00:04:06.629> like<00:04:06.720> whoa<00:04:06.900> man<00:04:07.139> how<00:04:07.319> come<00:04:07.440> some<00:04:07.709> purpose

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
was like whoa man how come some purpose

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.860 
was like whoa man how come some purpose
of<00:04:08.220> growing<00:04:08.459> as<00:04:08.549> someone<00:04:08.819> not<00:04:08.970> what<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.660> fuck

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
of growing as someone not what the fuck

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.409 
of growing as someone not what the fuck
is<00:04:10.019> Ahmad<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.609> turn<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:11.970> realized

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
is Ahmad so I got to turn so I realized

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.460 
is Ahmad so I got to turn so I realized
that<00:04:12.540> man<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:12.900> thing<00:04:13.079> works<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that man this thing works and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.920 
that man this thing works and
coincidentally<00:04:14.400> when<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.120> looked<00:04:15.359> at<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.599> slow

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
coincidentally when I looked at the slow

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.300 
coincidentally when I looked at the slow
twitch<00:04:16.169> fibers<00:04:16.470> which<00:04:16.620> are<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
twitch fibers which are you you know the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.400 
twitch fibers which are you you know the
shoulders<00:04:17.699> forms<00:04:18.269> whatever<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.780> realized<00:04:19.260> that

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
shoulders forms whatever I realized that

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.979 
shoulders forms whatever I realized that
those<00:04:19.680> were<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.070> same<00:04:20.370> muscles<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.630> grew

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
those were the same muscles that grew

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.320 
those were the same muscles that grew
when<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.229> was<00:04:22.349> doing<00:04:22.560> 15<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.949> 20<00:04:23.219> reps<00:04:23.430> they<00:04:23.969> blew

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
when I was doing 15 to 20 reps they blew

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
when I was doing 15 to 20 reps they blew
up<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.260> looked<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.620> first<00:04:25.860> was<00:04:26.099> muscle

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
up then I looked at the first was muscle

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.170 
up then I looked at the first was muscle
fibers<00:04:26.729> there<00:04:27.150> were<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.390> same<00:04:27.690> ones

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
fibers there were the same ones

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.180 
fibers there were the same ones
coincidentally<00:04:29.050> grew<00:04:29.410> when<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.770> was<00:04:29.889> doing<00:04:30.009> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
coincidentally grew when I was doing the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.670 
coincidentally grew when I was doing the
heavy<00:04:30.400> lifting<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.810> I'm<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.320> know<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.530> you're

negative<00:06:02.139> sanctions<00:06:02.320> did<00:06:02.680> this<00:06:02.830> one<00:06:02.979> actually

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
negative sanctions did this one actually

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.969 
negative sanctions did this one actually
needs<00:06:03.510> more<00:06:04.510> repetitions<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.409> to<00:06:05.830> actually

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
needs more repetitions to to actually

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.040 
needs more repetitions to to actually
grow<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:06.849> hope<00:06:06.970> this<00:06:07.330> thing<00:06:07.539> helps<00:06:07.870> guys

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130 
some gains so all right guys use this

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.200 
some gains so all right guys use this
but<00:07:17.130> yeah<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:17.340> strategies<00:07:17.729> fatigue<00:07:18.060> the

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
but yeah the strategies fatigue the

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.330 
but yeah the strategies fatigue the
