without<00:00:40.530> without<00:00:41.520> making<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> too<00:00:42.149> weak<00:00:42.600> there

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
without without making it too weak there

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.670 
without without making it too weak there
you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.660> we'll<00:00:46.289> turn<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you have it and then we'll turn it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.330

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
around see I didn't get all of it so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340 
around see I didn't get all of it so
just<00:00:50.340> very<00:00:50.820> carefully<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.170> don't

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
just very carefully because you don't

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.670 
just very carefully because you don't
want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> work<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.910> too<00:00:54.329> thin<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
want to work that too thin because it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
want to work that too thin because it
loses<00:00:55.860> strength<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:56.850> it'll<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.210> wilty

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
loses strength and then it'll get wilty

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.310 
loses strength and then it'll get wilty
