elevated rail so today i'll be showing

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.679 
elevated rail so today i'll be showing
you<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:25.080> two<00:00:25.500> buildings<00:00:26.330> i'll<00:00:27.330> save<00:00:27.660> that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you these two buildings i'll save that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
you these two buildings i'll save that
that<00:00:28.470> white<00:00:28.710> building<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:30.210> next<00:00:30.390> time

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that white building there for next time

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
that white building there for next time
but<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.710> kinda<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.250> twisty

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
but this is it's kinda like two twisty

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.860 
but this is it's kinda like two twisty
buildings<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:34.130> notice<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:36.420> twisty

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
buildings i notice that this twisty

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
buildings i notice that this twisty
design<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.770> been<00:00:38.120> popular<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:40.969> architecture

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
design has been popular in architecture

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.750 
design has been popular in architecture
recently<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:44.399> smaller

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
recently so it's just a little smaller

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
recently so it's just a little smaller
so<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.719> made<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> white<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.379> black<00:00:46.620> black<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so i made a white and black black and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
so i made a white and black black and
white<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:50.180> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> yin

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
white as you can see kind of like a yin

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
white as you can see kind of like a yin
yang<00:00:52.020> thing<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.850> don't

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
yang thing going now they don't

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
yang thing going now they don't
intertwine<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.840> each<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.649> just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
intertwine with each other they just

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.760 
intertwine with each other they just
intertwined<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> ground<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.570> they're

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
intertwined on the ground so they're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.479 
intertwined on the ground so they're
stable<00:00:59.000> I<00:01:00.800> didn't<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:01.890> anything<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
stable I didn't put anything on the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.200 
stable I didn't put anything on the
inside<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.650> find<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.939> although<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> looks

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
inside I find that although it looks

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.219 
inside I find that although it looks
great<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.689> stuff<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> inside

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
great when you put stuff on the inside

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.390 
great when you put stuff on the inside
like<00:01:07.470> um<00:01:09.049> let's<00:01:10.049> say<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.250> you're

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
like um let's say let's say you're

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
like um let's say let's say you're
building<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.939> office<00:01:12.930> tower<00:01:13.170> something<00:01:13.680> like

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
building a office tower something like

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.030 
building a office tower something like
that<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> looks<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:16.500> takes<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> lot

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that it looks good but it takes up a lot

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.270 
that it looks good but it takes up a lot
of<00:01:17.070> time<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> fill<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> inside<00:01:18.450> with

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
of time to fill up the inside with

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.289 
of time to fill up the inside with
everything<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> fill<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> up

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
everything that you want to fill it up

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.109 
everything that you want to fill it up
with<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> floors<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.000> much

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
with so all the floors are pretty much

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
with so all the floors are pretty much
the<00:01:24.180> same<00:01:25.729> very<00:01:26.729> simple<00:01:30.049> there's<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the same very simple there's a lot of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.170 
the same very simple there's a lot of
grass<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> might<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> might<00:01:32.820> put

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
grass I don't know I might I might put

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.870 
grass I don't know I might I might put
some<00:01:33.420> trees<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.380> front<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.979> haven't<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
some trees out front I haven't really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.800 
some trees out front I haven't really
quite<00:01:36.180> decided<00:01:36.570> yet<00:01:37.939> once<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.090> once<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.479> fill<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
quite decided yet once I once I fill in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.399 
quite decided yet once I once I fill in
this<00:01:39.960> area<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.240> might<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:43.049> something

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this area here I might put something

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
this area here I might put something
here<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> matches<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.549> put<00:01:44.700> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
here that matches so if I put like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240 
here that matches so if I put like
certain<00:01:45.149> type<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> trees<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.960> something<00:01:46.350> for

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
certain type of trees or something for

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
certain type of trees or something for
this<00:01:47.369> area<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.970> might<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.570> trees<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.520> next<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this area I might put trees in next to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.389 
this area I might put trees in next to
these<00:01:50.729> buildings<00:01:51.770> these<00:01:52.770> buildings<00:01:53.130> actually

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
these buildings these buildings actually

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.560 
these buildings these buildings actually
when<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.549> built<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:53.970> we're<00:01:54.119> probably<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
when I built them we're probably the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
when I built them we're probably the
most<00:01:54.990> mathematical<00:01:55.829> buildings<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.369> built

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
most mathematical buildings have built

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.370 
most mathematical buildings have built
so<00:01:56.759> far<00:01:57.000> rather<00:01:57.930> than<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.710> by<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> I

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
so far rather than just going by I I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530 
so far rather than just going by I I
used<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.619> bit<00:02:01.680> math<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> simple<00:02:02.369> math<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
used a little bit math to simple math to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
used a little bit math to simple math to
build<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.649> order<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
build this so in order to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.589 
build this so in order to
curve<00:02:09.649> look<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.799> here<00:02:14.569> when<00:02:15.569> I

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
curve look good you can see here when I

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.729 
curve look good you can see here when I
would<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.659> is<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:19.049> one

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
would put in like where this is back one

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.479 
would put in like where this is back one
here<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:21.319> would<00:02:22.319> make<00:02:22.530> sure<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.159> in

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
here I would make sure that this is in

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.839 
here I would make sure that this is in
the<00:02:23.790> center<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.299> then<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.860> three

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
the center and then this is like three

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.759 
the center and then this is like three
equal<00:02:27.239> parts<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.049> can<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.620> then

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
equal parts here as you can see and then

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.280 
equal parts here as you can see and then
this<00:02:29.069> levels<00:02:29.790> four<00:02:30.239> equal<00:02:30.629> parts<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this levels four equal parts and this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
this levels four equal parts and this
it's<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.280> simple<00:02:32.790> math<00:02:32.940> right<00:02:33.739> very<00:02:34.739> simple

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's just simple math right very simple

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.509 
it's just simple math right very simple
but<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.750> think<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.049> came<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.349> good<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.950> looks<00:02:38.159> I

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
but I think it came out good it looks I

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.119 
but I think it came out good it looks I
feel<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> looks<00:02:39.480> good<00:02:39.659> I<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
feel it looks good I kind of like this

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.490 
feel it looks good I kind of like this
to<00:02:41.370> those<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:42.420> building's<00:02:42.930> themselves<00:02:43.079> are

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
to those the building's themselves are

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.979 
to those the building's themselves are
actually<00:02:43.799> two<00:02:44.040> bricks<00:02:44.340> apart<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.629> when<00:02:45.810> you're

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
actually two bricks apart so when you're

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.670 
actually two bricks apart so when you're
you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:46.980> up<00:02:47.280> top<00:02:47.549> or<00:02:47.849> down<00:02:48.000> below<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:49.470> looks

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you know up top or down below it looks

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.750 
you know up top or down below it looks
like<00:02:49.739> they're<00:02:49.980> really<00:02:50.250> close<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:50.730> another

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
like they're really close to one another

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
like they're really close to one another
but<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.079> middle<00:02:52.290> because<00:02:52.560> it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
but if you're in the middle because it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.559 
but if you're in the middle because it
twists<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.609> it<00:02:56.760> looks<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.180> looks<00:02:57.329> like

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
twists you know it looks it looks like

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.180 
twists you know it looks it looks like
there's<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.780> large<00:02:58.079> gap<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.500> between<00:02:58.769> I<00:03:01.190> don't

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
there's a large gap in between I don't

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.110 
there's a large gap in between I don't
know<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> thought<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.670> thought<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.970> looked

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
know I thought I thought that looked
