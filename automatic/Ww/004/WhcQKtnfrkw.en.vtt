00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.480
hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars.com and if
you didn't know this was a toyota

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.639
corolla well I wouldn't blame you

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.759
the corolla has been redesigned for 2009
but the styling actually looks a lot

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.509
like a mix between the outgoing model
and the current toyota camry now the new

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.270
corolla is about the same size as the
outgoing model but toyota says there's a

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.260
little bit more room inside as well as
in the trunk and finish inside is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.859
generally good there do seem to be a few
more misaligned panels here and there

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.280
then in the toyota matrix that we had
last week that's also been redesigned

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.480
for 2009 when we does look nice is the
contrasting trim pieces that kind of

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.440
liven up the center portion of the
dashboard there's fake wood trim and

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.110
silver painted plastic but they're
actually used sparingly enough they

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.129
really kind of a little bit of color
here that's generally nice the radio

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.839
controls have simple black plastic the
dials feel pretty high quality and it's

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.690
integrated into the dashboard pretty
nicely one of annoying feature is that

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.129
the clock here is actually integrated
into the instruments it cycles through

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.070
with an outside temperature display a
few other things if you want to see what

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.330
temperature it is outside

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.720
you won't know what time it is because
the radio doesn't tell you the a/c

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.500
controls are simple they fall kind of
easily to hand they're awfully clunky

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.710
though they don't feel very precise at
all we actually like the controls in the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.700
previous corolla better and the controls
in the honda civic generally blows out

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.480
of the water but the crow comes roaring
back in storage space and I can't

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.000
believe I just said corolla and war in
the same sentence

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
anyhow it's everywhere there's upper and
lower club compartments each one's

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200
pretty big as you can see there's also a
little tiny pockets to either side of

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.860
the center controls the center console
actually has two different compartments

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.190
an upper one lower one lower is pretty
big and like in the honda civic the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.640
armrest moves forward and backward for
drivers of different sizes taller people

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.460
will want to know how far back the
driver's seat moves I've got it all the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.280
way back in its rear most position the
upholstery in the seats actually like

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.220
pretty well couple of the cars that
commenters that it felt a little bit

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.909
dated leather seats with heated front
seats are optional and back legroom and

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.729
Headroom a little bit tight i have a
little bit better headroom actually then

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.409
I have legroom notice there's no center
armrest year the honda civic the mazda3

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.430
and even the hyundai elantra after one
cup holders are up here they kind of

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.090
flip out right here is a lot of moving
parts small families kids are gonna

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.659
shove their juicy juice boxes and sippy
cups in there there's gonna be the first

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.959
things to go like many of its
competitors the corolla has little

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.610
release pins right here

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.840
help

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.069
lower the back seat opening itself is
pretty wide total cargo volume is about

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.810
little over 12 cubic feet

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.300
it's on the low side for this segment
but it's still relatively competitive

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.110
and the crawl is abundant storage areas
and 35 miles per gallon on the highway

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.340
is just the ticket for a lot of small
car shoppers are the safety features six

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.430
airbags and anti-lock brakes are
standard and stability control and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.510
affordable 250 dollar option whether all
of that is enough to sway bars for a car

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.319
that may not be as outwardly appealing
as a honda civic or mitsubishi lancer is

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.209
still anybody's guess

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.310
