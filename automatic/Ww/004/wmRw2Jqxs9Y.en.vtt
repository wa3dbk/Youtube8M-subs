 [Music] 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.240
 Wow are you there 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.250
 hi people i'm julia rodrigues and here it is 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.210
 the girl and we will put together two 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:21.250
 delights in a single fruit and chocolate 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:24.010
 [Music] 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.050
 the coil today's recipe will need 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.800
 of your favorite fruits and very 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.420
 chocolate 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.840
 You can use remnants of Easter eggs. 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.430
 or bar of chocolate then people I already 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 I tried the chocolate 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.960
 indeed I have eaten enough of it I put 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.790
 this bowl of video because now the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.760
 people will have to melt chocolate and 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.160
 The trick is to put a video 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.199
 pan with hot water on the stove but this 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.390
 It's not a task for us, it's our mother. 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.590
 in short you will tell your mother that 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.719
 You have to stop the chocolate in a water bath 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.850
 then folks how much in the chocolate melts 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.590
 We'll get the barbecue kits and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 put the fruits that we like the most 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.629
 they will then put strawberry on a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.629
 Strawberry All I Spit 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.240
 I also like bananas but bananas 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.250
 I did not cut myself 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.190
 I cut her in half and now I'll do the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.039
 last of the street, I'm going to use a 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.080
 spoon and we'll pass the chocolate 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.299
 on the fruit but does not have to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.189
 a good tip is to turn to get the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.390
 over the fun part the ornament looks 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.770
 how beautiful it was 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 You know why I did not cut the band. 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.360
 has won lines because that's how it gets 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.909
 firm and safer starts to 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.369
 face her big pink lake and I go 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.130
 spend a little bit of that finish core 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.229
 But the important thing is not, it looks beautiful. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.979
 to be tasty but if you want to 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.630
 to make with other fruits apple kiwi 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.360
 Tangerine Mango looks how it got 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.030
 flashy 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:04.130
 [Music] 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.200
 so people after I let it cool 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.200
 I put it like this here and you can 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.540
 eat but before you will enroll in 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.540
 our channel and do not forget to enjoy 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.260
 this was very good
