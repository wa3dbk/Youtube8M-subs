00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
default base expresso setup so we have

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
default base expresso setup so we have
our<00:00:35.579> two<00:00:36.300> different<00:00:36.660> materials<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.010> so

what colors you want and then here's our
grid<00:00:43.350> maker<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> click<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.430> have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
grid maker and if we click on it we have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
grid maker and if we click on it we have
the<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.390> tab<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.230> side<00:00:46.469> which

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the little tab on the right side which

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.160 
the little tab on the right side which
houses<00:00:47.160> kind<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> expresso<00:00:48.480> rig<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
houses kind of all the expresso rig so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
houses kind of all the expresso rig so
here<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> options<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.000> can

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
here are all of the options so we can

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.630 
here are all of the options so we can
change<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.020> amount<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.440> rows<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> amount

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
change the amount of rows and the amount

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
change the amount of rows and the amount
of<00:00:53.730> columns<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> expand<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
of columns and we can kind of expand the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
of columns and we can kind of expand the
width<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.789> thing<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.030> easily<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.960> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
width of this thing very easily and then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.049 
width of this thing very easily and then
we<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> change<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> thickness

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
we can change the thickness

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
we can change the thickness
I<00:01:00.359> will<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.930> bump<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> too<00:01:01.680> high

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I will not bump this up too high

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
I will not bump this up too high
otherwise<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.520> starts<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> distorting

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
otherwise it starts kind of distorting

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
otherwise it starts kind of distorting
and<00:01:03.899> running<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.379> each<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.820> we

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and running into each other but then we

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
and running into each other but then we
have<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> whole<00:01:06.299> size<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
have the whole size and you can make the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
have the whole size and you can make the
mesh<00:01:08.130> tighter<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.510> weave<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:10.049> bit

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
mesh tighter or the weave a little bit

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.859 
mesh tighter or the weave a little bit
looser<00:01:10.520> if<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> our<00:01:12.390> preview

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
looser if we actually go to our preview

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
looser if we actually go to our preview
mode<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.979> things<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.430> bogging<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.000> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
mode if things are bogging down you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.460 
mode if things are bogging down you can
use<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.360> preview<00:01:15.750> mode<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.229> you'll<00:01:16.350> be

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
use your preview mode and then you'll be

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
use your preview mode and then you'll be
able<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.040> fluctuation<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.850> doing

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
able to see what fluctuation is doing

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.399 
able to see what fluctuation is doing
and<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.450> basically<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.990> raising<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and it's basically just raising the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.270 
and it's basically just raising the
height<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:19.979> splines<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
height of these splines now for the the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.530 
height of these splines now for the the
display<00:01:23.280> type<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.450> our

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
display type we have you know our

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
display type we have you know our
standard<00:01:24.990> subdivisions<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.490> have

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
standard subdivisions and then we have

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
standard subdivisions and then we have
grids<00:01:26.909> subdivisions<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> hypernurbs<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
grids subdivisions and hypernurbs you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
grids subdivisions and hypernurbs you
can<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.619> ahead<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.829> play<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> if

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can go ahead and play with all that if

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
can go ahead and play with all that if
you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.840> here's<00:01:31.079> where<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> put

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.310 
completely new material just drag it
drop<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.549> into<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.939> slot<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
drop it into this slot now we have this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
drop it into this slot now we have this
animation<00:01:37.979> tab<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.060> ahead<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
animation tab and if you go ahead and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.340 
animation tab and if you go ahead and
kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> play<00:01:39.720> around<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> you're

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
kind of play around with this you're

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
kind of play around with this you're
gonna<00:01:40.470> realize<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.000> nothing's<00:01:42.000> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
gonna realize that nothing's really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.289 
gonna realize that nothing's really
doing<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:43.079> right<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> bit

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
doing anything right so it's a bit

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.120 
doing anything right so it's a bit
confusing<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:46.049> how<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> animate<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
confusing to know how to animate this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
confusing to know how to animate this
thing<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> twirl

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
thing well what you have to do is twirl

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.740 
thing well what you have to do is twirl
this<00:01:49.079> down<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.540> what

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this down and this right here is what

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.539 
this down and this right here is what
you<00:01:51.780> need<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.079> animate<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you need to animate so actually you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
you need to animate so actually you
can't<00:01:53.759> even<00:01:53.939> click<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.390> once<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.439> need

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
can't even click on this once you need

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
can't even click on this once you need
to<00:01:55.680> actually<00:01:55.920> double<00:01:56.189> click<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.850> double

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to actually double click on it so double

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.789 
to actually double click on it so double
click<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.500> we're<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
click on that and then we're going to

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.429 
click on that and then we're going to
get<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.820> object<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> have

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
get this object and it's going to have

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
get this object and it's going to have
all<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:02.340> different<00:02:02.729> properties<00:02:03.180> so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
all these these different properties so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.609 
all these these different properties so
you<00:02:03.570> don't<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> play<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you don't really want to play with the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.139 
you don't really want to play with the
strength<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.369> kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> jack<00:02:05.939> all

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
strength that's gonna kind of jack all

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
strength that's gonna kind of jack all
up<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.530> offset<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.160> something<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
up but the offset is something that you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
up but the offset is something that you
can<00:02:08.819> animate<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.360> from

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can animate and it's going to and from

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
can animate and it's going to and from
now<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.310> able<00:02:14.460> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
now you can see that we're able to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.210 
now you can see that we're able to
animate<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.690> splines<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.500> which<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.980> really

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
animate these splines on which is really

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.390 
animate these splines on which is really
cool<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.880> let's<00:02:17.910> start<00:02:18.300> at<00:02:18.450> zero<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.130> we'll

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
cool so let's start at zero and we'll

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 
cool so let's start at zero and we'll
make<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> keyframe<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.810> end<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.500> go

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
make a keyframe and go to the end and go

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.980 
make a keyframe and go to the end and go
ahead<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.920> make<00:02:23.160> keyframe<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.910> zero<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.450> now

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
ahead and make keyframe for zero and now

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.770 
ahead and make keyframe for zero and now
we're<00:02:25.170> getting<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.680> nice<00:02:25.950> animation<00:02:26.550> right

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
we're getting that nice animation right

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.390 
we're getting that nice animation right
so<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> cool<00:02:28.260> thing<00:02:28.470> about<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.890> animation

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so the cool thing about this animation

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.430 
so the cool thing about this animation
is<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> our<00:02:31.200> grid

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
is that now if we go back to our grid

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.950 
is that now if we go back to our grid
maker<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.730> these<00:02:32.850> animation<00:02:33.540> options

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
maker we have these animation options

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.780 
maker we have these animation options
which<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.650> we've<00:02:34.770> animated<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.520> these

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
which now that we've animated it these

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
which now that we've animated it these
are<00:02:36.060> now<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.420> place<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> growth<00:02:37.230> delay<00:02:37.590> if

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
are now in place so the growth delay if

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.930 
are now in place so the growth delay if
we<00:02:37.800> turn<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:38.460> basically

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
we turn that on that's basically

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
we turn that on that's basically
staggering<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> start<00:02:40.110> times<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.470> these

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
staggering the start times of these

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.010 
staggering the start times of these
different<00:02:41.010> splines<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.570> looks<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.870> we

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
different splines and that looks like we

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.090 
different splines and that looks like we
actually<00:02:43.110> need<00:02:43.410> some<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.680> time<00:02:43.860> because

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
actually need some more time because

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.910 
actually need some more time because
it's<00:02:44.460> staggering<00:02:45.450> them<00:02:45.750> by<00:02:45.840> 50<00:02:46.260> frames<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.890> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's staggering them by 50 frames so I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
it's staggering them by 50 frames so I
guess<00:02:47.130> we'll<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.580> down<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.850> 20<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.270> see

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
guess we'll just go down to 20 and see

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.880 
guess we'll just go down to 20 and see
what<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.630> looks<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.800> kind

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
what that looks like so now we're kind

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.710 
what that looks like so now we're kind
of<00:02:49.980> getting<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.400> staggered<00:02:51.000> growing<00:02:51.570> on

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
of getting that staggered growing on

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.180 
of getting that staggered growing on
look<00:02:51.990> which<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.200> pretty<00:02:52.590> sweet<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.130> can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
look which is pretty sweet so you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.760 
look which is pretty sweet so you can
have<00:02:53.280> these<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:54.240> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.630> weaves<00:02:54.960> just

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
have these these kind of weaves just

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.400 
have these these kind of weaves just
slowly<00:02:56.100> building<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.960> delay

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
slowly building and then we have a delay

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.290 
slowly building and then we have a delay
random<00:02:58.890> which<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.490> kind<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.150> add

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
random which is going to kind of add

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.420 
random which is going to kind of add
some<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.780> randomness<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.860> which<00:03:02.280> is

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
some more randomness into it which is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.090 
some more randomness into it which is
really<00:03:02.580> great<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.300> then<00:03:04.020> we<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.440> our<00:03:04.620> spring

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
really great and then we have our spring

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.830 
really great and then we have our spring
which<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.460> going<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.090> kind<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.450> make<00:03:06.600> them

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
which is going to kind of make them

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960 
which is going to kind of make them
bounce<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.040> bit<00:03:08.250> once<00:03:08.430> they<00:03:08.580> get<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
bounce a little bit once they get to the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.670 
bounce a little bit once they get to the
end<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.900> have<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> little<00:03:10.350> bit<00:03:10.440> more

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
end so that they have a little bit more

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560 
end so that they have a little bit more
life<00:03:10.950> when<00:03:11.190> they're<00:03:11.340> animating<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.420> is

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
life when they're animating so that is

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.330 
life when they're animating so that is
