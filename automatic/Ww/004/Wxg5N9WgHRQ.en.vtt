00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.079
 with the automatic testing system alternately per year 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.079
 various materials are tested 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.529
 a plastic and 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 on the other hand 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.939
 The following film will explain how the two test systems work 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 more ala 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.090
 no test system Indications of their construction consist of the consequences 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.000
 infectious diseases 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.800
 the big screen decade for system 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 the magazine table with the samples straps 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
 «The cross-section it device and the barcode reader 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.240
 like the testing machine 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 and change the length 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.840
 thereon 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 ca 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 the operation of the test system it is very simple 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.940
 the operator stores the test-relevant data of the samples in 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 a database 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 put the samples in the tropics tear gas 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 Plastic samples are accepted in stacks 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.480
 the sample material is variable and to the custom samples geometries 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.910
 customizable 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.970
 the operator put stocked thoben carriers on the magazines 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.610
 according to the magazine their leads allowed the testing facility 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.509
 this is tax program in Beijing's first trial order from the database 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.960
 and the associated bober with a vacuum gripper from the magazine 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 by measuring the evolution today 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 will calculate the samples cross section 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:16.319
 The samples previously system can with each Zwick testing machine up to 250 kilos and 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 Eutin be combined 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.909
 after the correct saving is set longer, the sample from the 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.840
 Handling system clamped in the samples and the experiment started 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.350
 To protect against splinters to the samples is a protective screen 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.350
 entered in the test report 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.069
 the width and length change recording will automatically reach after 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.189
 put in front of power 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.450
 Depending on the material's behavior and romp stretching can be of different lengths 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.449
 other things are always used on the program 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.959
 the demolition process at the plant had noted Istria 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.040
 For this, the half-height are stored individually to the magazine 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.519
 1 attacker is used for the removal 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.739
 this brings the samples to the cross-section measuring device 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.229
 The wide and length change transducer automatically replaces 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.229
 reach the front of strength 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.079
 for control, the operator can track the move on the screen 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.810
 after the trial 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.460
 The samples will be leftovers with special gripper arm Post »test holders 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 withdrawn 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.990
 the results are displayed on the screen by Torsten Roth 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.710
 they can be transferred to a host computer 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.960
 In addition to the automatic check are always on manual check 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.629
 For this purpose, the sample is decoupled from the gud system for system 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.869
 The operator can control the expiration of the migratory band by remote control 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.650
 Due to the compact structure of the automation unit it only becomes 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.240
 a small footprint needed 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.840
 subjective influences are due to the high positioning accuracy of the 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840
 automatic samples to guide excluded 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.000
 the traceability of the test conditions after the so 9001 is 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 ensured 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:00.339
 check with mind
