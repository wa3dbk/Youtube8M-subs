00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
toys over here i want to make sure that
this<00:01:28.710> expansion<00:01:29.189> does<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this expansion does not get up and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
this expansion does not get up and
running<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.950> skeleton

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
running so this is more of a skeleton

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.780 
running so this is more of a skeleton
crew<00:01:32.579> hoping<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.380> draw<00:01:34.650> his<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
crew hoping that it will draw his and a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
crew hoping that it will draw his and a
balata<00:01:36.450> engrave<00:01:37.259> i'm<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.799> perhaps<00:01:38.369> i<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.759> be

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
balata engrave i'm not perhaps i will be

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.100 
balata engrave i'm not perhaps i will be
able<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> perhaps<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.220> will<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.549> able<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
able to and perhaps i will be able to

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
able to and perhaps i will be able to
push<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.470> push<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.820> he<00:01:44.970> tries<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> move<00:01:45.540> some

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
push and push as he tries to move some

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.840 
push and push as he tries to move some
of<00:01:45.750> his<00:01:45.930> units<00:01:46.200> over

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.490 

so<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> comes<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.570> medevac<00:01:51.960> medevacking<00:01:52.410> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so in comes this medevac medevacking to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710 
so in comes this medevac medevacking to
go<00:01:52.560> ahead<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> drop<00:01:53.010> on<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.730> he<00:01:54.300> has<00:01:54.480> he

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
go ahead and drop on down and he has he

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.750 
go ahead and drop on down and he has he
does<00:01:54.870> not<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.530> expansion<00:01:56.340> really

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
does not have this expansion really

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.100 
does not have this expansion really

really<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.130> macro<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:05.239> also<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.319> should<00:04:06.350> have

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
really a macro up also I should have

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.559 
really a macro up also I should have
more<00:04:07.040> production<00:04:07.610> buildings<00:04:07.970> at<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.299> time

for<00:04:09.260> some<00:04:09.410> reason<00:04:09.709> I'm<00:04:09.830> still<00:04:10.220> not<00:04:10.459> getting

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
for some reason I'm still not getting

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.030 
for some reason I'm still not getting
the<00:04:10.910> same<00:04:11.209> amount<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.660> gas<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.530> really

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
the same amount of gas that I really

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.000 
the same amount of gas that I really
need<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.640> perhaps<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.599> and<00:04:14.840> yeah<00:04:15.530> perhaps<00:04:15.769> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
need and perhaps I and yeah perhaps I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.940 
need and perhaps I and yeah perhaps I
needed<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.989> better<00:04:17.989> unit<00:04:18.380> combination<00:04:18.859> I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
needed more a better unit combination I

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.159 
needed more a better unit combination I
was<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> very<00:04:19.850> very<00:04:20.090> heavy<00:04:20.389> gas<00:04:20.780> build

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
was going to a very very heavy gas build

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.200 
was going to a very very heavy gas build
producing<00:04:21.889> thor's<00:04:22.250> early<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.150> then

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
producing thor's early on and then

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.180 
producing thor's early on and then
medevacs<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.800> reason<00:04:24.830> why<00:04:25.070> I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
medevacs so that is the reason why I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.010 
medevacs so that is the reason why I
