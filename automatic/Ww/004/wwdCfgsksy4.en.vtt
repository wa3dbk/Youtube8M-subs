notification<00:00:58.399> came<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.579> very<00:01:00.030> slow<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.960> I've

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
notification came up very slow so I've

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930 
notification came up very slow so I've
been<00:01:01.170> using<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.590> m16<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.219> red<00:01:02.430> thought<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
been using the m16 with red thought and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
been using the m16 with red thought and
the<00:01:03.510> Python<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> pistol<00:01:04.890> which<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> just

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the Python as the pistol which is just

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
the Python as the pistol which is just
like<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> Magnum<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.090> modern<00:01:06.330> warfare<00:01:06.479> 2<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
like the Magnum and modern warfare 2 and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.980 
like the Magnum and modern warfare 2 and
the<00:01:07.710> Python<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.610> half-decent<00:01:08.970> pistol<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the Python is only half-decent pistol so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.859 
the Python is only half-decent pistol so
far<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.310> knowledge<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.360> game<00:01:12.570> as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
far and to my knowledge on this game as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859 
far and to my knowledge on this game as
that<00:01:13.409> I've<00:01:13.500> unlocked<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.150> m16<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that I've unlocked so the m16 is just a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450 
that I've unlocked so the m16 is just a
standard<00:01:16.080> gun<00:01:16.439> everyone<00:01:16.830> knows<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> it's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
standard gun everyone knows that it's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
standard gun everyone knows that it's
kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> powerful<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.650> powerful<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
kind of powerful it's not as powerful in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
kind of powerful it's not as powerful in
this<00:01:20.369> game<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:22.500> something<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this game but it's just something you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.109 
this game but it's just something you
can<00:01:23.369> use<00:01:23.600> pretty<00:01:24.600> easily<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.400> next<00:01:26.820> class<00:01:26.970> I'm

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
can use pretty easily the next class I'm

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
can use pretty easily the next class I'm
moving<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> mp5<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.159> extended

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
moving on to is the mp5 with extended

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.210 
moving on to is the mp5 with extended
mags<00:01:29.970> I'd<00:01:30.689> recommend<00:01:31.170> using<00:01:31.350> steady<00:01:31.770> aim<00:01:31.979> with

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
mags I'd recommend using steady aim with

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
mags I'd recommend using steady aim with
this<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.329> using<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this you can see that I'm just using the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440 
this you can see that I'm just using the
same<00:01:33.720> perks<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.490> only<00:01:35.490> swap<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> second

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
same perks and only swap in the second

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
same perks and only swap in the second
perk<00:01:36.659> around<00:01:36.990> occasionally<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:37.950> custom

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
perk around occasionally on these custom

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
perk around occasionally on these custom
glasses<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.850> I'd<00:01:39.720> used<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.259> steady<00:01:40.710> aim<00:01:40.920> just

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
glasses and I'd used the steady aim just

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
glasses and I'd used the steady aim just
because<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.520> gun<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.119> for

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
because this gun is pretty good for

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
because this gun is pretty good for
spraying<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.500> actually<00:01:43.799> better<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.520> screen

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
spraying it's actually better a screen

being like a really easy to use gun to a
really<00:02:34.420> frustrating<00:02:34.930> gun<00:02:35.139> and<00:02:35.349> in<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.700> last

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
really frustrating gun and in the last

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.309 
really frustrating gun and in the last
matchup<00:02:37.180> late<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> year<00:02:37.959> before<00:02:38.019> it

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.099 
matchup late just the year before it
came<00:02:38.469> offline<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:39.359> picked<00:02:40.359> up<00:02:40.480> gun<00:02:40.719> well<00:02:41.079> I

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
came offline I picked up gun well I

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.500 
came offline I picked up gun well I
picked<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.469> this<00:02:41.650> con<00:02:41.889> with<00:02:42.249> grip<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.359> was

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
picked up this con with grip and it was

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.509 
picked up this con with grip and it was
an<00:02:43.599> absolute<00:02:43.900> beast<00:02:44.139> it<00:02:44.829> was<00:02:45.069> really<00:02:45.370> accurate

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
an absolute beast it was really accurate

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.030 
an absolute beast it was really accurate
kill<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.389> enemies<00:02:46.659> a<00:02:46.689> lot<00:02:46.930> faster<00:02:47.469> so<00:02:47.889> I<00:02:47.919> think

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
kill the enemies a lot faster so I think

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.349

as I've been seen as more than one four
to<00:03:37.930> one<00:03:38.139> but<00:03:38.919> it's<00:03:39.459> still<00:03:39.609> alright<00:03:39.819> I'm<00:03:40.150> gonna

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
to one but it's still alright I'm gonna

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.659 
to one but it's still alright I'm gonna
change<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.989> L<00:03:41.199> is<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.799> early<00:03:42.069> 96

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669

change it to the L is it the early 96
sniper<00:03:43.479> but<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.349> don't<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.650> I'll<00:03:44.799> be<00:03:44.889> using<00:03:45.009> a

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
sniper but I don't think I'll be using a

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.679 
sniper but I don't think I'll be using a
lot<00:03:45.189> of<00:03:45.310> snipers<00:03:45.729> in<00:03:45.759> this<00:03:46.000> game<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.389> be<00:03:46.419> honest

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
lot of snipers in this game to be honest

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:47.939 
lot of snipers in this game to be honest
just<00:03:46.870> cause<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.139> quick<00:03:47.379> scope<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.769> being

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
just cause of the quick scope and being

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.280 
just cause of the quick scope and being
nerfed<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.120> there's<00:03:49.629> not<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:49.870> much<00:03:50.019> point

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
nerfed so there's not really much point

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.909 
nerfed so there's not really much point
or<00:03:50.530> enjoyment<00:03:50.799> using<00:03:51.489> them<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.470> last<00:03:53.709> English

we hear is the kill streak sale I've
been<00:03:56.919> using<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.189> spy<00:03:57.400> plane<00:03:57.699> just<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:58.030> help

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
been using the spy plane just to help

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.649 
been using the spy plane just to help
I'm<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.389> team<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:58.900> just<00:03:59.530> because<00:03:59.680> easy<00:04:00.659> easier

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
I'm a team and just because easy easier

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.789 
I'm a team and just because easy easier
when<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.019> know<00:04:02.109> where<00:04:02.259> the<00:04:02.349> enemies<00:04:02.620> are

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
when you know where the enemies are

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.939 
when you know where the enemies are
I've<00:04:03.159> been<00:04:03.549> used<00:04:03.699> an<00:04:03.790> attack<00:04:04.060> helicopter

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
I've been used an attack helicopter

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.649 
I've been used an attack helicopter
attack<00:04:05.949> helicopter<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> chopper<00:04:07.479> gunner

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
attack helicopter and the chopper gunner

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.659 
attack helicopter and the chopper gunner
I<00:04:08.259> wouldn't<00:04:08.919> really<00:04:09.009> recommend<00:04:09.129> that

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
I wouldn't really recommend that

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.189 
I wouldn't really recommend that
actually<00:04:09.969> I<00:04:10.000> need<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.209> change<00:04:10.389> this<00:04:10.599> around<00:04:10.810> I

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
actually I need to change this around I

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.469 
actually I need to change this around I
probably<00:04:11.379> use<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.819> napalm<00:04:12.819> strike

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
probably use a napalm strike

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.449 
probably use a napalm strike
I<00:04:13.780> think<00:04:13.989> that's<00:04:14.139> what's<00:04:14.289> called<00:04:14.560> an<00:04:14.829> attack

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
I think that's what's called an attack

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.640 
I think that's what's called an attack
helicopter<00:04:15.639> just<00:04:16.419> because<00:04:17.079> it's<00:04:17.320> more<00:04:17.440> useful

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
helicopter just because it's more useful

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.560 
helicopter just because it's more useful
and<00:04:18.159> you're<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.430> likely<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.820> get<00:04:18.969> that<00:04:19.030> then

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and you're more likely to get that then

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.959 
and you're more likely to get that then
the<00:04:20.289> chopper<00:04:20.680> gunner<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.549> have<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.789> wait

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
the chopper gunner and you have to wait

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.730 
the chopper gunner and you have to wait
for<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.360> chopper<00:04:22.510> done<00:04:22.840> for<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.409> attack

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
for the chopper done for the attack

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.690 
for the chopper done for the attack
helicopter<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.400> cool

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
helicopter it's cool

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.840 
helicopter it's cool
to<00:04:24.940> use<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.180> chopper<00:04:25.510> gunner<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:27.580> can<00:04:27.730> use

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
to use the chopper gunner so you can use

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.950 
to use the chopper gunner so you can use
that<00:04:28.000> if<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.150> want<00:04:28.210> I've<00:04:28.660> not<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:28.930> seen

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
that if you want I've not really seen

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.600 
that if you want I've not really seen
