of bulk as you can tell it's speed is
pretty<00:00:41.850> bad<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.690> looks<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> it'd<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
pretty bad but it looks like it'd be a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.819 
pretty bad but it looks like it'd be a
hard<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.860> heavy<00:00:44.460> revenge<00:00:45.210> hitting

now I think could be an issue too
bulk<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.160> too<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
bulk is pretty good too so in the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.410 
bulk is pretty good too so in the
diancie<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.670> course<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.060> gonna<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.680> 175

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
diancie of course it's gonna have 175

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.670 
diancie of course it's gonna have 175
defense<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> special<00:01:10.020> defense<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
defense and special defense which is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.240 
defense and special defense which is
ridiculous<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.900> only<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.200> 50<00:01:13.500> HP<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ridiculous but it only has 50 HP so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
ridiculous but it only has 50 HP so
maybe<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> chuckle<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.930> probably<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
maybe like a chuckle but probably a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
maybe like a chuckle but probably a
little<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.560> better<00:01:16.619> than<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.390> that's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
little bit better than that so that's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789

mention<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.110> last<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.340> into

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
mention one last thing when you go into

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
mention one last thing when you go into
the<00:01:51.329> vs<00:01:51.570> recorder<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.470> something

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the vs recorder and you have something

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.020 
the vs recorder and you have something
using<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.700> Norse<00:01:54.030> fear<00:01:54.390> there's<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:55.409> frames<00:01:56.030> in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
using a Norse fear there's two frames in

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.050 
using a Norse fear there's two frames in
there<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.549> hard<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> see

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
there that will it's very hard to see

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
there that will it's very hard to see
but<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.420> easy<00:02:00.600> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> point<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
but it's easy kind of to point out but

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.709 
but it's easy kind of to point out but
there's<00:02:01.680> two<00:02:01.829> frames<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.119> during

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
there's two frames in there that during

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.780 
there's two frames in there that during
our<00:02:04.020> sphere<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:04.829> show<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> bottom<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
our sphere it will show the bottom of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.109 
our sphere it will show the bottom of
the<00:02:05.939> vs<00:02:06.270> recorder<00:02:06.869> which<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.710> weird<00:02:08.119> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the vs recorder which is really weird so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
the vs recorder which is really weird so
I've<00:02:09.599> never<00:02:09.959> seen<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> before

the Nintendo 2ds with Pokemon X&amp;Y these

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.059 
the Nintendo 2ds with Pokemon X&amp;Y these
will<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.939> cheaper<00:02:27.599> probably<00:02:28.109> range<00:02:28.319> about<00:02:28.590> I

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
will be cheaper probably range about I

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.720 
will be cheaper probably range about I
don't<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:30.590> $130<00:02:31.590> 140-something<00:02:32.400> like

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
don't know like $130 140-something like

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.030 
don't know like $130 140-something like
that<00:02:32.939> I'm<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.719> doing<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.260> random<00:02:34.530> estimates

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that I'm just doing my random estimates

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.470 
that I'm just doing my random estimates
they're<00:02:35.639> not<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.090> changing<00:02:36.420> anything

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
they're not actually changing anything

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.899 
they're not actually changing anything
to<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> 3d<00:02:37.230> asset<00:02:37.500> or<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.129> 2d<00:02:38.370> s<00:02:38.459> at<00:02:38.609> all<00:02:38.700> like

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
to a 3d asset or to the 2d s at all like

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.449 
to a 3d asset or to the 2d s at all like
no<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.719> design<00:02:40.349> changes<00:02:40.829> which<00:02:41.069> i<00:02:41.189> think<00:02:41.250> is

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
no like design changes which i think is

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.679 
no like design changes which i think is
kind<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.700> stupid<00:02:41.879> because<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.329> know<00:02:42.450> when<00:02:42.599> you

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
kind of stupid because you know when you

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.089 
kind of stupid because you know when you
release<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.019> fondle<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.530> usually<00:02:43.829> have<00:02:43.950> like

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
release the fondle you usually have like

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.649 
release the fondle you usually have like
some<00:02:44.310> sort<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.549> design<00:02:44.819> impact<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.389> but<00:02:45.540> who

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
some sort of design impact on it but who

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.390 
some sort of design impact on it but who
knows<00:02:45.840> they're<00:02:46.379> just<00:02:46.620> not<00:02:46.709> decide<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.129> do<00:02:47.250> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
knows they're just not decide to do that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.669 
knows they're just not decide to do that
so
