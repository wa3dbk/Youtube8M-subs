00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.979
 hello friends how were you welcome to 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.230
 how to play and play on the guitar 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.910
 and good this time I'm going to meet 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.830
 with the order that Antonio Garcia made me 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.440
 the young man two hands left that rope 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 well he asked me to see if he could 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.520
 show him how the rhythm of the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.980
 song by silvio rodrÃ­guez detail of 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 a woman with a hat ok let's see 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.020
 how is we going to see the first tones 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.329
 how it sounds more or less and with the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.399
 first part doing the rhythm that 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.079
 does it already serves you for the rest of the 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.090
 song because after what you have to 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.500
 varies are the accents that are leading to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.530
 the chords within the sung melody 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.640
 ok then pulling at this rate you 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.579
 it's much easier for later 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.719
 continue the whole subject I do not know whether to have 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.460
 the score and everything but anything 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.680
 then its the complete subject 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.790
 then let's see what would be the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.790
 first part would be like this 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.289
 alright then the pace is like this we're going to 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.289
 do the C major 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.320
 deceleration 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.020
 and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.020
 ah 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.040
 so what I recommend is that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.409
 touch with the index and the thumb I say 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.990
 these two in what the strings so very 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 casualties are all those who work and only 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.090
 you take off your thumb when you're going to do 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 the bass is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.050
 if suddenly the thumb the hammer 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.940
 of the thumb it is very difficult for you 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 you can do is make the basses with the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 index or when you're here if so 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.470
 the bass you mark it with the index 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.250
 what marks that is the agreement of 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.810
 full 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.810
 with the bass of the chord 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.209
 but cuter if you do it with the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.209
 thumb not knowing everything 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.860
 after a detail that sometimes does not 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.720
 Take into account is that if you play here 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.360
 when you make the thumb hammer 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.970
 you play more back it will not sound so ugly 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.709
 what hurts you more what would be the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.709
 part of this from here 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.420
 that's where the yolk part hurts the most 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.800
 of the finger that is hurting you but you 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.800
 it sounds better when you play we take out 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.459
 and it sounds like c 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.380
 well this has been everything I hope you 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.750
 serve you out and anything to 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.750
 the orders we see good luck
