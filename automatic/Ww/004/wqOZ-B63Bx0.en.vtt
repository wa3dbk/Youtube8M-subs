00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.100
 minecraft basket but a way of cubes 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.110
 with its 160 needs to calculate 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.960
 both seasons is really that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.270
 which lasted longer 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.090
 I will leave myself a way of q of 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.060

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.659
 the two guys that even though it was n't 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.539
 the serchio lasted a long time was the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.489
 cashier let's say he started 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.220
 the one we have today, guys 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.600
 mycup second because it is a series that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 I'm really enjoying it a lot 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.420
 because all the farms I like to do 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.100
 I build them I take the time there 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.680
 even if it were needed there will be a 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.320
 make me very beautiful and anyway guys 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.519
 I continue to make factories is 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.280
 basically what I like to do 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.340
 in minecraft he is the first teen body 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 this is no between downloads 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.060
 main one you will find here description 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.900
 however, there is no lack of one from the map 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.230
 bases in the updated booklet map 10 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.750
 place a map that you are found with 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 steve miner bros and it really is there 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:02.019
 enjoy that crazy way that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.019
 they study but no, no, no 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.920
 guys I would say that for these stacks everything 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:29.070
 close the boxes millions of blogs 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:32.160
 no no no eye behind bay giving that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.490
 we'll try because maybe not by who it is 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.140
 came out of the ass, that is, out of it 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.030
 groom that I decided to start one 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.080
 series with hicks but in stock market which I have 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.910
 asked in my normal and monica clip 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.520
 81 what will be the sequel of tricks 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.950
 weighed on the web and not always with that 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.850
 name however is this smog that is 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.850
 developing a lemons 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.330
 I think he doesn't have actors yet 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.160
 so none of this way to anyone then 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 announced the beginning of this new series 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.750
 try for the special one thousand members 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.630
 and about minecraft guys for 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.250
 this special one thousand subscribers 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.190
 I wanted to build in our world he 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.350
 michael ii ferre this like you is one 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.940
 written of which depicts precisely the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.470
 thousand number but it was not written 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.419
 any as it may seem 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.910
 actually there is a rai circuit behind it 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.000
 trade that is every episode of the day 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.780
 and allows you to cut with the inscription in 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.700
 up to the blue number 1999 in fact it is behind 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.669
 at every curve you see hanging there is a 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.889
 piston that can print all numbers from 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.479
 1 to 9 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.639
 maybe we will see in operation and a 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.139
 another episode of michael cited loses 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.389
 but it is always very secretive of 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.820
 guns with associated delegations ea 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.030
 depending on the combination we give 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.350
 inside or the panel from the outside 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.290
 I see 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.990
 it didn't seem right to do this 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.520
 like that moment because this is the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.290
 series that I like best about my channel 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.760
 and finally guys to finish this 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.710
 special thousand subscribers but you have it 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.340

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.470
 mascini but basins but it is one of the networks 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.840
 bigger ones present on youtube counts well 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.640
 11 million members and according to 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.920
 many for gaming is the best because 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.460
 other youtuber that they practice 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.480
