00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
our skills off as a team I think we've

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.849 
our skills off as a team I think we've
played<00:00:28.839> some<00:00:28.990> great<00:00:29.080> cricket<00:00:29.439> over<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.679> last

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
two years and there's no reason why

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.329 
two years and there's no reason why
we're<00:00:32.379> not<00:00:32.410> going<00:00:32.650> to<00:00:32.710> go<00:00:32.830> into<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:33.100> this

we're not going to go into that this
game<00:00:33.519> confident<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:35.230> we've<00:00:35.320> got<00:00:35.440> every

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
right to be yeah I think during the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140

team<00:00:40.089> that<00:00:40.239> have<00:00:40.629> played<00:00:40.839> beautifully

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
team that have played beautifully

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.569 
team that have played beautifully
throughout<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.620> World<00:00:41.860> Cup<00:00:42.070> obviously

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
throughout this World Cup obviously

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.119 
throughout this World Cup obviously
undefeated<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:43.239> far<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.840> team<00:00:44.379> who's<00:00:44.530> grown

in<00:00:45.280> confidence<00:00:45.399> going<00:00:45.879> throughout<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.629> I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
in confidence going throughout and I

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.709 
in confidence going throughout and I
think<00:00:47.920> when<00:00:48.100> when<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:49.000> look<00:00:49.180> down<00:00:49.329> our<00:00:49.539> team

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
think when when you look down our team

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.689 
think when when you look down our team
we<00:00:49.870> match<00:00:50.260> up<00:00:50.289> quite<00:00:50.649> well<00:00:50.680> they<00:00:51.460> match<00:00:51.670> up

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
we match up quite well they match up

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.099 
we match up quite well they match up
well<00:00:51.969> against<00:00:52.239> us<00:00:52.359> too<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.750> it's<00:00:52.870> going<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.020> be

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
well against us too so it's going to be

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.170 
well against us too so it's going to be
a<00:00:53.170> great<00:00:53.379> game<00:00:53.590> but<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:54.820> something

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
a great game but it's it's something

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.819 
a great game but it's it's something
that<00:00:55.329> terms<00:00:55.899> of<00:00:56.019> psychological<00:00:56.649> stuff

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
that terms of psychological stuff

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.349 
that terms of psychological stuff
there's<00:00:57.039> with<00:00:57.340> they've<00:00:57.789> been<00:00:57.940> playing<00:00:58.149> well

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
there's with they've been playing well

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.319 
there's with they've been playing well
so<00:00:59.079> I've<00:00:59.199> way<00:00:59.350> so<00:00:59.559> i<00:00:59.590> don't<00:01:00.129> i<00:01:00.370> don't<00:01:00.940> think

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
so I've way so i don't i don't think

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.450 
so I've way so i don't i don't think
that<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.690> I<00:01:02.350> think<00:01:02.829> I'll<00:01:02.920> move<00:01:03.129> on<00:01:03.280> pretty

wicked<00:01:13.660> it's<00:01:13.780> been<00:01:13.959> quite<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> bit<00:01:14.440> but<00:01:14.950> it

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
wicked it's been quite a bit but it

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:16.589 
wicked it's been quite a bit but it
didn't<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.369> played<00:01:15.550> really<00:01:15.819> true<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.240> was<00:01:16.569> a

00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:16.599 
didn't it played really true and was a

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.020 
didn't it played really true and was a
good<00:01:16.810> wicket<00:01:16.959> but<00:01:17.490> still<00:01:18.490> two<00:01:18.640> days<00:01:18.819> out<00:01:18.970> from

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
good wicket but still two days out from

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.089 
good wicket but still two days out from
the<00:01:19.240> game<00:01:19.390> it's<00:01:19.569> hard<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> tell<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.950> the

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
the game it's hard to tell that the

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.160 
the game it's hard to tell that the
wicket<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.520> change<00:01:21.759> quite<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.060> bit<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.479> here

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
wicket can change quite a bit of it here

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
wicket can change quite a bit of it here
in<00:01:23.289> sydney<00:01:23.560> especially<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.039> a<00:01:24.369> couple<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.610> days

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.410 

they've<00:01:29.259> gone<00:01:29.410> with<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.700> game<00:01:30.700> plan<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:31.000> seems

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
they've gone with a game plan that seems

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.449 
they've gone with a game plan that seems
to<00:01:31.569> be<00:01:31.720> clicking<00:01:32.319> for<00:01:32.470> them<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:32.739> i<00:01:32.920> think

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
to be clicking for them now i think

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.999 
to be clicking for them now i think
after<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.330> after<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.259> test<00:01:35.560> series<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
after the after the test series and the

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.070 
after the after the test series and the
tri-series<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.759> was<00:01:36.910> then<00:01:37.630> we<00:01:37.660> played<00:01:37.959> em

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
tri-series it was then we played em

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.830 
tri-series it was then we played em
again<00:01:38.319> in<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.950> warm-up<00:01:39.250> game<00:01:39.599> their<00:01:40.599> plan

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
again in a in a warm-up game their plan

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.059 
again in a in a warm-up game their plan
hasn't<00:01:41.080> looked<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.500> changed<00:01:41.890> too<00:01:42.039> much

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
hasn't looked to have changed too much

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.430 
hasn't looked to have changed too much
but<00:01:42.459> i<00:01:42.789> suppose<00:01:43.479> have<00:01:43.780> just<00:01:43.959> spent<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.259> lot<00:01:44.410> more

factor<00:01:58.989> i<00:01:59.200> suppose<00:01:59.560> for<00:01:59.830> for<00:02:00.759> them<00:02:00.849> at<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
factor i suppose for for them at the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
start of the innings I think so yeah

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.109 
start of the innings I think so yeah
they've<00:02:03.069> just<00:02:03.190> played<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.429> lot<00:02:03.670> more<00:02:03.789> cricket

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
conditions and the length your bowl and

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.080 
conditions and the length your bowl and
stuff<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.929> it's<00:02:08.349> no<00:02:08.910> rocket<00:02:09.910> soaring

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
