00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.029 
easy I mean even breaking it down as
simple<00:01:47.840> as<00:01:47.930> they<00:01:48.049> possibly<00:01:48.290> could<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.860> only

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
simple as they possibly could it's only

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.639 
simple as they possibly could it's only
four<00:01:49.220> steps<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.030> not<00:01:50.299> only<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.110> app<00:01:51.229> really

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
four steps so not only is the app really

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.899 
four steps so not only is the app really
useful<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:52.700> also<00:01:52.909> extremely<00:01:53.590> user<00:01:54.590> friendly
