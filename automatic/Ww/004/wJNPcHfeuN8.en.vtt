my class and little bead caps that will
be<00:01:06.500> great<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.280> cover<00:01:08.610> those<00:01:09.030> big<00:01:09.510> hole<00:01:09.810> beads

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
be great to cover those big hole beads

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.640 
be great to cover those big hole beads
ok<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.430> let<00:01:14.430> me<00:01:14.670> show<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.030> quickly<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ok so let me show you quickly what I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.600 
ok so let me show you quickly what I
have<00:01:17.159> done<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:18.260> so<00:01:19.260> this<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:22.610> beads

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
have done here so this are just beads

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
have done here so this are just beads
and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:25.049> even<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.729> cover<00:01:27.240> design<00:01:27.750> for

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and I don't even like cover design for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.860 
and I don't even like cover design for
them<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.920> connect<00:01:29.520> them<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.120> just

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
them I just connect them I just

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.770 
them I just connect them I just
alternate<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.010> colors<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:33.030> everything<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
alternate the colors and everything and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.280 
alternate the colors and everything and
they<00:01:33.960> came<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.860> nice<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:37.770> example<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
they came out nice for example it's the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.140 
they came out nice for example it's the
design<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:43.159> have<00:01:44.299> bigger<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.690> loop

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
design is that I have bigger and loop

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.660 
design is that I have bigger and loop
bigger<00:01:48.150> why<00:01:49.159> why<00:01:50.159> wrapped<00:01:50.610> loops<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:53.250> adds

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
bigger why why wrapped loops so it adds

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.890 
bigger why why wrapped loops so it adds
to<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.890> design<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.820> makes<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.049> look<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.900> have

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
to the design it makes it look that have

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.210 
to the design it makes it look that have
that<00:02:01.200> lazy<00:02:01.740> look<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.900> example<00:02:03.930> even<00:02:04.830> if

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
that lazy look so for example even if

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.320 
that lazy look so for example even if
the<00:02:05.909> smallest<00:02:06.540> bead<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:08.129> here<00:02:08.330> with

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the smallest bead that i have here with

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.690 
the smallest bead that i have here with
a<00:02:09.360> bigger<00:02:09.869> loop<00:02:11.269> it's<00:02:12.769> nice<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:14.129> comes<00:02:14.430> out

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
a bigger loop it's nice it comes out

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.360 
a bigger loop it's nice it comes out
nice<00:02:14.969> so<00:02:15.389> this<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.319> Rondo

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
nice so this is just to Rondo

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.440 
nice so this is just to Rondo
beads<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.739> I'm<00:02:20.739> sure<00:02:21.069> most<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.330> already

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
beads so I'm sure most of you already

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.509 
beads so I'm sure most of you already
knows<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.099> i<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:25.330> want<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.629> show<00:02:25.959> you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
finish this necklace and just using my

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.660 
finish this necklace and just using my
round<00:02:45.549> nose<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.569> just<00:02:47.730> bend<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:49.870> wire

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
round nose you will just bend your wire

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.440 
round nose you will just bend your wire
at<00:02:51.670> an<00:02:51.910> angle<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.790> l<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:57.220> i<00:02:57.640> will

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
at an angle like that l and then i will

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.309 
at an angle like that l and then i will
put<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.819> wire<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:02.110> bigger<00:03:02.500> portion<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.670> your

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
put the wire the bigger portion of your

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.130 
put the wire the bigger portion of your
chain<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.590> your<00:03:06.099> round<00:03:06.370> nose<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.180> get<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
chain of your round nose so you get the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:19.580 
chain of your round nose so you get the
bigger<00:03:09.090> loop<00:03:10.709> ok<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.209> then<00:03:17.200> i<00:03:17.519> will

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
bigger loop ok like that and then i will

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:28.259 
bigger loop ok like that and then i will
connect<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:21.190> my<00:03:25.709> here<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> beads<00:03:28.030> that

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
connect it to my here to the beads that

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.610 
connect it to my here to the beads that
i<00:03:28.690> already<00:03:29.230> made<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.760> don't<00:03:31.329> forget<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:32.200> do

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
i already made so don't forget to do

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.379 
i already made so don't forget to do
that<00:03:32.650> before<00:03:33.220> closing<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.299> up<00:03:34.450> because<00:03:34.840> that

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
that before closing it up because that

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.370 
that before closing it up because that
can<00:03:37.389> be<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.599> problem<00:03:37.660> i<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:40.150> made<00:03:40.780> that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
can be a problem i have made that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.740 
can be a problem i have made that
mistake<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:43.349> ok<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:44.410> just<00:03:45.989> wire<00:03:46.989> wrap

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
mistake so I know ok so just wire wrap

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.110 
mistake so I know ok so just wire wrap
around<00:03:50.849> three<00:03:51.849> times<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:53.319> I'm<00:03:53.709> using<00:03:54.040> 24<00:03:54.849> gauge

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
around three times so I'm using 24 gauge

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.839 
around three times so I'm using 24 gauge
wire<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.739> wire<00:03:57.069> is<00:03:58.049> very<00:03:59.049> soft<00:03:59.560> soft<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
wire so the wire is very soft soft and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.140 
wire so the wire is very soft soft and
pliable<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.930> work<00:04:02.109> with<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:03.400> don't<00:04:03.609> even<00:04:03.790> have

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
pliable to work with you don't even have

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.509 
pliable to work with you don't even have
to<00:04:04.209> use<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:06.690> chain<00:04:07.690> nose<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.319> wrap<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:09.040> but<00:04:09.310> I

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
to use the chain nose to wrap it but I

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.339 
to use the chain nose to wrap it but I
prefer<00:04:10.060> doing<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.750> cut<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.139> close<00:04:11.380> and

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
prefer doing that you cut it close and

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.300 
prefer doing that you cut it close and
just<00:04:14.430> kind<00:04:16.019> chuck<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.500> ok

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310
