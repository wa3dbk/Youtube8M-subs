me<00:05:53.610> out<00:05:53.789> of<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.000> round<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.479> guess<00:05:54.659> I<00:05:54.840> lost

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
me out of the round I guess I lost

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.080 
me out of the round I guess I lost
connection<00:05:55.500> or<00:05:55.620> something<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:56.310> that's<00:05:56.819> just

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
connection or something but that's just

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.749 
connection or something but that's just
a<00:05:57.270> quick<00:05:57.479> look<00:05:57.949> hopefully<00:05:58.949> maybe<00:05:59.129> later<00:05:59.430> on<00:05:59.520> or

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
a quick look hopefully maybe later on or

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.860 
a quick look hopefully maybe later on or
something<00:06:00.000> like<00:06:00.060> that<00:06:00.150> I'll<00:06:00.449> try<00:06:00.690> it<00:06:00.719> again

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
something like that I'll try it again

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.990 
something like that I'll try it again
and<00:06:01.229> maybe<00:06:01.500> I<00:06:01.620> have<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:01.949> better<00:06:02.129> connection<00:06:02.340> but

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
and maybe I have a better connection but

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.459 
and maybe I have a better connection but
