the<00:00:01.079> purpose<00:00:01.410> of<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.070> to

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
the purpose of this video is to

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.510 
the purpose of this video is to
demonstrate<00:00:03.200> how<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.259> gas<00:00:04.740> gauge<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.220> his<00:00:05.310> car

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
demonstrate how the gas gauge in his car

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.950 
demonstrate how the gas gauge in his car
works<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:06.319> will<00:00:07.970> attempt<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> start<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.510> car<00:00:09.719> as

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
works I will attempt to start the car as

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.470 
works I will attempt to start the car as
you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.650> see<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.340> gas<00:00:11.550> gauge<00:00:11.790> reads<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
you can see the gas gauge reads a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.400 
you can see the gas gauge reads a
quarter<00:00:13.349> tank<00:00:14.330> put<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> key<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.930> starts

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
quarter tank put the key in it starts

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.400 
quarter tank put the key in it starts
and<00:00:19.560> sputters<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:22.640> will<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:24.410> gas

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and sputters out will not start gas

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.820 
and sputters out will not start gas
gauge<00:00:25.680> isn't<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.279> moving<00:00:27.410> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
gauge isn't really moving this is the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.279 
gauge isn't really moving this is the
exact<00:00:29.130> same<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.750> happening<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
exact same thing that was happening the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.770 
exact same thing that was happening the
day<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> bought<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> car<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.510> will<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:34.910> put<00:00:35.910> some

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
day I bought the car I will now put some

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:57.450 
day I bought the car I will now put some
gas<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:39.090> gas<00:00:39.270> tank

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:45.890 

good

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:02:02.970 

okay<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.180> now<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.780> will<00:01:56.050> start<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.530> car<00:02:01.980> I'm

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
okay and now I will start the car I'm

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay and now I will start the car I'm
just<00:02:03.220> cycling<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> fuel<00:02:03.850> pump<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> couple

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
just cycling the fuel pump on a couple

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.669 
just cycling the fuel pump on a couple
times<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:05.020> clear<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> air<00:02:05.470> out<00:02:05.620> of<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.800> system

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
times to clear the air out of the system

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.660 
times to clear the air out of the system
and<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.970> car<00:02:10.470> should<00:02:12.420> start<00:02:13.420> right<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:14.670> give

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and the car should start right up give

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:25.190 
and the car should start right up give
it<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.910> couple<00:02:16.300> tries

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.860 

still<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.380> turning<00:02:26.680> system<00:02:33.480> there<00:02:34.480> with<00:02:34.720> me

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
still out a turning system there with me

00:02:34.870 --> 00:03:01.030 
still out a turning system there with me
here

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:28.510 

it<00:03:02.040> will<00:03:02.280> start<00:03:02.610> financially<00:03:05.030> almost<00:03:06.030> there

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.180 

and<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.810> gas<00:03:30.020> gauge<00:03:30.290> never<00:03:30.680> moves

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:43.200 

so<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.770> car<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.100> running<00:03:42.250> out<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.910> see

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
so and the car is running out you see

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.100 
so and the car is running out you see
the<00:03:43.300> tachometer

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
the tachometer

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.000 
the tachometer
and<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:45.520> gas<00:03:45.700> gauge
