00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.240
 clio mod 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.250
 this moon palace ugt-a san andreas is a 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.270
 So I liked it a lot, I hope that 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.490
 you too good let's start once 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.530
 already downloaded in winrar file of the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.200
 description of the video will click 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.540
 right to extract here is going to leave you two 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.790
 folders of text files where 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.470
 come the creators of the mod if they want 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.470
 eliminate it because it will not need 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.230
 and 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.070
 all right 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 well now open the folder that I read 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.110
 copy inside and stick it on the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.510
 folder that I read from your gta san andreas 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.510
 u2 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 well now open i am the editor axis 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.380
 preferred in my case is the al cis ing 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.630
 but I do not know why shit does not open like that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.560
 to use the graffiti mg editor now 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.560
 follow my steps 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.510
 they open file and look for the folder 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.450
 models of your gta san andreas and open the 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.850
 I file called 3 point and then mg 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.460
 They give cement to rep and they look for the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
 folder gta 3 freshly extracted and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.110
 they select the two files and they give 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.120
 open and that would be everything now I will leave you 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.830
 a small demonstration of what it is about 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.830
 the game we see ourselves in the game 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.859
 let's see 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.640
 and a lot 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.739
 to the houses 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.320
 good the very simple way to use only 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.330
 they write gum and the weapon will come out later 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.460
 you already point to any person and 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.920
 you shoot as you shoot any weapon and 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.840
 will start dancing together with a music 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.060
 very good I hope and the mod has them 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.980
 liked a greeting see you 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.980
