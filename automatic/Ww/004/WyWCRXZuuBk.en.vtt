00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.590
 that is never because never return to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.080
 purpose of fiction and sketch 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.970
 or whatever it was of conflicts like 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.519
 example what was shot between wanda 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.079
 nara and evangelina anderson yes because of 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.669
 somehow it affects you because it is 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.039
 within your orbit to within your 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:24.249
 program and where there is an internal 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.649
 staff that then goes out and ends in 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.349
 a generational conflict 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.390
 because not to talk fire but not 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.660
 talks that with whom with evangelina or 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.490
 with guards please say it was the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.150
 problem of it and it's still problem 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.150
 from her 3 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.010
 exploding your house clear but it was but 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.630
 why happened what happened between to for a 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.600
 disconnection of mine with my production 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.850
 simply that's why he understood sir never 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 it would have happened but because you wanted to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 one 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.579
 it did not matter that wanda nara cite the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.910
 where in wonderful Europe filled with 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.910
 euros 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.670
 what killed me was having had a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.380
 quilombo with my production for these two 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.360
 them with what I told myself not what 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.950
 I can believe after what happened 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.220
 but this time because it went through the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 disconnections with this we 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.750
 it served and a lot a lot in teles and the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.399
 production was on one side and you 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.929
 thought went by another no no the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.939
 this thought 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.770
 went through a disconnection simply in 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.600
 Right now we are a year and a half 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.909
 that we are working together this is a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.640
 marriage this is a marriage word 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:47.439
 with which I forgive the carpet because 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.240
 you do not have to chat just have to 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.329
 chat but I annoy you gospelina 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 Anderson directly but that the 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:01.149
 treated badly nothing happened with what 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 happened in nothing because in a place that the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.630
 true that we had a bomb that is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610
 all divine but it has to do with that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.319
 with which the heads can not be no 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.389
 They can go through different places 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.680
 so if I have a work group 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.579
 wonderful 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.340
 mariana we all have our things 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.680
 but we are all growing in this is 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.019
 our first the first I first 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.640
 protagÃ³nico to 100 television then to 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.400
 12 noon for a lot of people 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.439
 It is also a challenge among the staff 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.549
 then it is a growth and one as I know 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.680
 who is learning everything that you 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.840
 what happened to you was surprised or was it something 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.730
 foreseeable what happened to me with whom 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.730
