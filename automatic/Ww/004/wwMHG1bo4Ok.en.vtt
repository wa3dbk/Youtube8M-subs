00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
you might see something like this don't

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.100 
you might see something like this don't
worry<00:02:37.240> about<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:38.350> that's<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.830> then

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110

way<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:51.040> our<00:02:51.160> back<00:02:51.550> once<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.990> finished

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
way so our back once this is finished

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.680 
way so our back once this is finished
okay<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.010> guys<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.940> see<00:02:55.150> these<00:02:55.420> are

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
okay so guys as you can see these are

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.900 
okay so guys as you can see these are
like<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.930> fastest<00:02:56.530> render<00:02:56.860> settings<00:02:57.220> because

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
like the fastest render settings because

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.300 
like the fastest render settings because
it<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.720> taking<00:02:59.670> 17<00:03:00.670> seconds<00:03:01.180> per<00:03:01.660> furring<00:03:02.310> even

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
it is taking 17 seconds per furring even

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.710 
it is taking 17 seconds per furring even
less<00:03:03.610> than<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.850> sometimes<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.410> come<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.720> use

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
less than that sometimes so come on use

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.720 
less than that sometimes so come on use
