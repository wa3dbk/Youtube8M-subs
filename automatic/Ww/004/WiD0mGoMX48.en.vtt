00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 as the one as you are all today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.000
 apart from showing you those little birds 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 that you always hear at the bottom of my 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 videos that as you will see are three canaries 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.599
 and two mandarin diamonds I want 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.980
 show you the benefits of having 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.980
 plants at home 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 now 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.829
 nothing else 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 nature is wise has it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.410
 proven for centuries and continues 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 doing it today flowers and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.610
 plants with which we decorate our 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 houses are not just to make them more 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 show the benefits they generate 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.210
 these living beings are indispensable 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.580
 for our health our state of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.220
 encouragement and in general to maintain a 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.410
 quality of life in a simple way and 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.600
 natural its physical properties and 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.240
 Chemicals bring many advantages 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.759
 but to enjoy them first 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 what we have to do is include them in 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.560
 our home and take care of the plants 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.720
 renew the air quality by filtering 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 this through a vital process 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 called photosynthesis dioxide 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.640
 carbon is absorbed and transformed into 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.979
 oxygen that will again be expelled at 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.539
 outside, thus renewing the quality of the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.820
 air the usual cycle of 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.979
 photosynthesis takes place by day 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 since they take advantage of sunlight to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.479
 said activity but there are others 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 groups of plants belonging to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 hot environments that invest in the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.480
 order and perform it at night this is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.390
 the case of orchids 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.550
 or the bromeliads there is a false myth 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 that if you sleep with plants in the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 These rooms will rob you of oxygen 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.990
 at night one plant per large that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.570
 will not steal even a tenth of the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 oxygen that if someone else would take you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 that he slept in the same room and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.900
 think that if the plants robbed us of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.330
 oxygen at night all those people 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.550
 who live in villages or cabins surrounded 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 of leafy forests would not have oxygen 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.390
 to breathe 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 the plants increase the humidity of the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.440
 this benefits us because 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.630
 helps us to maintain our 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.450
 mucous throat and skin well 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.390
 hydrated preventing future discomfort 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.150
 or illnesses the sick too 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.460
 recover faster surrounded by plants 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.260
 the plants are also a remedy 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.510
 natural against pollution or 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.210
 air pollution of our homes 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 absorb harmful gases particles 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.390
 chemical removes the smoke microorganisms 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.910
 pathogens and volatiles and picks up dust 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.010
 reducing its presence in the air until 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.000
 by 20 percent thanks to this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.800
 cleaning 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.510
 feeling of fatigue that we experience 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 as a result of an atmosphere 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.760
 charged decreases generating from this 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 way great feeling of wellbeing 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.140
 even improving the mood 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.690
 absorb and reduce electricity 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.570
 static our houses are every time 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.459
 more overcrowded electrical appliances and 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.130
 computer equipment that create fields 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.800
 electrical systems responsible for pain 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.320
 tiredness head tension among others 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.450
 many ailments reduce the noise on 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.820
 all in enclosed spaces and with floors 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.739
 hard although this acoustic alteration is 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.080
 perceive more when the frequency of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.080
 sound is very high definitely 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.120
 can say that they drown the sounds and for 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.060
 Last to say that plants are beings 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.470
 alive who also feel and suffer 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.200
 acquire a plant since childhood 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.720
 take care to water it and watch it grow 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.930
 the self-esteem of people and reinforces 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.239
 the responsibility of them good 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.090
 I hope you liked this video in 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.430
 company of my canaries and my diamonds 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.710
 Mandarin by the way, stop making yourself 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.140
 a question you have plants at home 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.140
 see you in the next video chao

 no no 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.770
 no no no
