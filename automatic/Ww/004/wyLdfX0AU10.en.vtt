00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello everyone in hell youtube side 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.770
 screens and we are at an exhibition 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.230
 computex 2013 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.590
 this is a draw and expensive and on the stand and mass 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.030
 you can poboksirovat real 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.710
 thailand champion champion here 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 this boxing with such inflatable 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.410
 pears 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 but besides this here is shown very much 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.109
 funny device now i will take this off 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.720
 a piece and here these amusing device 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.820
 called ipad mini here you are 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 watch ipod mini right on the stand and we 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.099
 in fact of course this is not a mini ipad 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's just a copy of it or rather not a copy 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 and sleep 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.460
 separate devices that produce 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 companies mass she's going too 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.770
 run it not only on sale in 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 China and Taiwan there and in general on 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 Worldwide Worldwide told us 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.890
 company representative want as you can see 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 and besides that he said that all the tablets 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 the same therefore 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.949
 why not he does not look like ipad 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.350
 mini he's another little let's see 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.750
 a little bit the body is called a tablet 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.420
 armhole 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.829
 81 let's twist his body like this 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 he looks like a lot down here 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.700
 there are connectors with dima there is micro usb 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.950
 there is also a separate charging connector 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 headphone jack card slot 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.070
 of memory 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.479
 This is the way I will generally give in ipad mini 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 you can insert a memory card and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.610
 add megabytes more accurate gigabytes 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.220
 there are three buttons on top of it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 power and volume control at the back 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.310
 we are traditionally located behind us 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 camera and speaker so well now let's 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 do all the same what we need 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.850
 naturally here make it comparable to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 This ipad is not this device 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.999
 ipad mini look 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.819
 find 10 differences i found 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:47.939
 There are no buttons in front of the rest 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.990
 it seems even seems to me a small screen 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 Right here straight butt stand screen here 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.319
 7 point eighty five tenths of an inch 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.409
 1024 by 768 resolution example is the same 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.959
 which sub menu if i attach the device 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.149
 we will see what thickness is even 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.560
 matches look and even here these 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.930
 the borders are the same 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.110
 shiny are the same beveled so 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.780
 most likely this device will cost 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 much cheaper with ipad not because 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.970
 how else was he with him 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.160
 compete 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.989
 it works naturally on android on 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.849
 android 4 2 jellybin by the way 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.599
 works pretty fast look all 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.250
 flipping itself is quite inside all worth while 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.170
 r mass as a representative told us 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.010
 besides the processor itself the processor is here 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 allwinner a31s 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.810
 quad he is probably quite good i 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.150
 By the way, this processor is the first time. 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.430
 I see devices have not used yet 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.340
 I know how compatible it is with various 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.739
 toys but basically as seen from 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.419
 just scrolling through desktops all 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.370
 works pretty fast so 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.160
 Most likely the device will also work 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.230
 let's try everything run the camera 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.329
 what kind of camera do we have here 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.769
 she is 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.190
 we take pictures of a pretty girl with a boxing 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.319
 pear 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.319
 very difficult to turn around and of course 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.620
 here and see what happened 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.110
 ok so but basically like this 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.769
 The quality of the camera is tolerable enough for 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.450
 tablet bright beautiful photo that's all 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.810
 thanks of course the girls are droid 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.090
 mature exhibition high computer 2013 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.920
 Of course see our reviews we still 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.920
 there will be a lot so here
