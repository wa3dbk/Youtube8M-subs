00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.559 
actually quite a bit of variability
between<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:24.430> knives<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:25.030> how<00:02:25.209> early<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
between the knives of how early the

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.869 
between the knives of how early the
lock-up<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.140> but<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.800> could<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.580> this

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
lock-up was but I could see that this

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.520 
lock-up was but I could see that this
one<00:02:28.060> had<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> really<00:02:28.480> good<00:02:28.599> lockup<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.380> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
one had a really good lockup so this is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.580 
one had a really good lockup so this is
the<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> picked

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the one I picked

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.680 
the one I picked
real<00:02:32.590> easy<00:02:32.769> one-handed<00:02:33.400> operation<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:34.540> got

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
real easy one-handed operation it's got

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.110 
real easy one-handed operation it's got
a<00:02:34.720> nice<00:02:34.930> strong<00:02:35.319> pocket<00:02:35.800> clip<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.880> goes

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
a nice strong pocket clip on it it goes

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.030 
a nice strong pocket clip on it it goes
in<00:02:37.300> with<00:02:37.560> three<00:02:38.560> screws<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.569> again<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.920> know

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
in with three screws and again you know

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.120 
in with three screws and again you know
these<00:02:42.220> screws<00:02:42.700> are<00:02:42.730> going<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.390> these<00:02:43.690> are

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
these screws are going in these are

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.039 
these screws are going in these are
nylon<00:02:45.130> or<00:02:45.610> polycarbonate<00:02:45.940> handles<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
nylon or polycarbonate handles and

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.080 
nylon or polycarbonate handles and

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
got this carabiner built into it so you

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.690 
got this carabiner built into it so you
can<00:03:04.810> clip<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> pack<00:03:05.650> or<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.069> belt<00:03:06.370> loop<00:03:06.519> or

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
can clip it to a pack or a belt loop or

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.539 
can clip it to a pack or a belt loop or
something<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.269> then<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:07.900> also<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.549> bottle

I<00:04:07.480> picked<00:04:08.169> the<00:04:08.260> straight<00:04:08.530> edge<00:04:08.680> version

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
I picked the straight edge version

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.440 
I picked the straight edge version
because<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.310> easier<00:04:12.609> for<00:04:12.669> us<00:04:12.849> to<00:04:12.910> sharpen

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450
