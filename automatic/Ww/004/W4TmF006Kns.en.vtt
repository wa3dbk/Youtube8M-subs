00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.769
 we go 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.690
 hello good everyone is smart I'm going to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.450
 tell you something that is in the latter 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.540
 days is talking a lot about everything 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.160
 in the USA and what and how we have spent 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.340
 this information because they know you very 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.590
 pending of these things 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.620
 so I said there have been boys a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.550
 man an illustrator that in a designer 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.590
 of concept 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.239
 so that you understand ideas and then 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.220
 he draws them that is why this is called fruit and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.770
 has complained that it has crashed 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.220
 copied his drawings for the fourth of 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.920
 times 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.970
 I want you to see the images of those 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.230
 drawings and the stars and now we're going to 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.200
 see comment 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.690
 this is your website you are watching him 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.570
 has a cover has a good drawing 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 for there you see the complaint of the saying 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 which star has been copied as of its 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.020
 draft 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.530
 that the drawing the drawing of the first 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.320
 world war and in which a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.560
 giant a giant robot and they left 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.710
 certain things that he says that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.010
 star has copied completely and here 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 the drawing must be done from the f 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.990
 star of tlc and now is the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.170
 cover of your drawing as you can see it 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.560
 the robot sees is a giant that is 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.480
 almost as you understand back you see the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 trenches on the bridge you see 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.570
 especially xavi up a tank is worth 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 then it is very similar to what he 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.580
 did 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.729
 here you can see the two images of the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.710
 trailer of trelles and the one of its drawing there 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.260
 you see the bridge of him 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.720
 and now here is this bridge that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.600
 supposedly it's the same as he did 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 then they look 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.000
 all rays all rays equal 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.150
 that all the rays of temperature 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 that there was the tank the tank that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 It is also here and the tank was 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.960
 above the tank as you can be 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.960
 watching there 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.720
 people 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.910
 you see what I said you see all the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 rays on the planes light aircraft 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.270
 flying 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.550
 the same temperature with the thing of 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.400
 all the rays and that afterwards you see and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.360
 up the zeppelin the zeppelin that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.440
 I would see also because there is also seen and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.230
 these are all the images worth 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.900
 there you can see how the robot 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.900
 take all the planes good 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 what does this mean this man says 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.940
 that have been copied 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.000
 I 'm going to say my opinion, I do not think 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.000
 it can be because 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.569
 it already had prepared ago from 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.590
 that went out word war vale 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.499
 since I was the radios of the risk vale 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.599
 then on the radio of dellys already 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:24.290
 he was talking about a giant's project 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.409
 and then I think that of course this man 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.530
 has done this a year ago a year ago 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:34.099
 just then if this man created this 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.750
 a year ago it can not be because 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.810
 they already had this prepared to do 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.580
 much more time people here I leave it 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.130
 it is information 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.010
 or I leave it for you to think 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.710
 say you comment everything that happens to you 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.900
 by the head it's worth 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.590
 give a like to subscribe and until the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.590
 next video
