00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
way the way it was laid out and that's

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.470 
way the way it was laid out and that's
what<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:22.530> figured<00:06:22.890> out<00:06:23.010> you<00:06:23.250> know<00:06:23.280> what<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.820> am

NOT<00:06:24.720> going<00:06:24.930> to<00:06:24.960> get<00:06:25.140> to<00:06:25.320> where<00:06:25.440> I<00:06:25.470> want<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.800> be<00:06:25.980> I

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
NOT going to get to where I want to be I

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.210 
NOT going to get to where I want to be I
need<00:06:26.640> to<00:06:27.000> stay<00:06:27.450> in<00:06:27.720> that<00:06:27.750> bulk<00:06:28.320> phase<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.010> put

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
need to stay in that bulk phase and put

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.100 
need to stay in that bulk phase and put
on<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.430> size<00:06:29.850> and<00:06:30.210> put<00:06:30.360> on<00:06:30.450> that<00:06:30.480> weight<00:06:30.870> and

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
on that size and put on that weight and

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.570 
on that size and put on that weight and
and<00:06:31.980> bulk<00:06:32.370> up<00:06:32.630> using<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:34.560> proper<00:06:34.950> supplements

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
and bulk up using the proper supplements

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.030 
and bulk up using the proper supplements
to<00:06:36.390> get<00:06:36.600> me<00:06:36.780> there<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.230> had<00:06:37.560> to<00:06:37.620> figure<00:06:37.800> that<00:06:37.980> out

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
to get me there I had to figure that out

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.350 
to get me there I had to figure that out
and<00:06:38.400> and<00:06:39.330> then<00:06:40.020> at<00:06:40.200> that<00:06:40.320> point<00:06:40.380> I<00:06:40.980> can<00:06:41.669> then<00:06:42.150> go

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
and and then at that point I can then go

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.210 
and and then at that point I can then go
through<00:06:42.390> the<00:06:42.720> lean<00:06:42.900> phase<00:06:43.230> and<00:06:43.650> get<00:06:43.860> shredded

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
through the lean phase and get shredded

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.880 
through the lean phase and get shredded
and<00:06:44.490> that's<00:06:45.330> exactly<00:06:45.690> what<00:06:46.050> I<00:06:46.080> did<00:06:46.320> I<00:06:46.470> stayed

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
and that's exactly what I did I stayed

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.420 
and that's exactly what I did I stayed
in<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.880> phase<00:06:48.180> longer<00:06:48.900> until<00:06:49.890> I<00:06:49.919> got<00:06:50.160> to<00:06:50.340> where

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
in the phase longer until I got to where

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.190 
in the phase longer until I got to where
I<00:06:50.460> wanted<00:06:50.790> to<00:06:50.850> be<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:51.240> I<00:06:51.450> was<00:06:51.540> like<00:06:51.720> wow<00:06:51.990> okay
