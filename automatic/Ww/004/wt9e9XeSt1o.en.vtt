00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 a dossier 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.399
 it's impressive 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.570
 12 years 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.800
 I did not lose anything 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.900

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 fourteen anon 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.500
 it is not recent 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.320
 fortnight 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.849
 fortnight 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.089
 5:10 a.m. 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.089
