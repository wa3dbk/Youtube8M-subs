00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
inside the fences and then we will make

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
inside the fences and then we will make
it<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> finish<00:01:03.989> line<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> right

here and then at the finish line I'm
going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.820> special<00:01:10.220> wielding<00:01:11.220> sword

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610

do<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:15.300> here's<00:02:15.810> our<00:02:15.990> studying

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
do that and then here's our studying

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.580 
do that and then here's our studying
line<00:02:17.120> ok<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:18.510> we're<00:02:18.690> ready<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.440> took<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
line ok now we're ready it just took a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.760 
line ok now we're ready it just took a
second<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:19.980> had<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> change<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.960> game<00:02:22.410> mode<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
second I had to change the game mode to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
second I had to change the game mode to
survival<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.300> know

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
survival so that we can you know

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320 
survival so that we can you know
actually<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.380> makes<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.130> Betsy<00:02:26.970> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
actually I think it makes the Betsy you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.060 
actually I think it makes the Betsy you
know<00:02:27.450> Betsy<00:02:27.660> she<00:02:28.020> can't<00:02:28.260> jump<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.710> much<00:02:28.920> on

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
know Betsy she can't jump as much on

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.860 
know Betsy she can't jump as much on
survival<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.730> definitely<00:02:29.910> want<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.270> for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
