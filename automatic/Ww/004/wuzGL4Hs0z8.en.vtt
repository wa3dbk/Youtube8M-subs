00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Christmas has not even arrived but the preparations 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.580
 for the carnival that same the carnival of the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 next year have begun 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 villagers and village merchants 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 Madalena mobilize to try 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.560
 decentralize the revelry and take the blocks 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.020
 to other regions of the city 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.019
 good memories of the carnival a lot of people 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 You're very much going to want to stay like 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 River and only smaller and is cheaper than 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.679
 people were not going to talk 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.219
 this year the street carnival of são paulo 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.309
 seems to have been rediscovered until whom 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 not very close to batucada is over 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.489
 joking around 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 the amount of people is very large 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 people participate until I go behind 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.539
 of blocks but on success hit 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.600
 several complaints have also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 lack of chemical toilets 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 dirt and light congestion with the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.250
 noise 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.830
 English Tom Green leads a group of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.100
 residents of the madalena village who dialogue 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.840
 with the city hall they fight 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.080
 especially for the party to be 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 distributed to other areas herein are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.270
 muds behave half dozen 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.820
 blocks in maxson now we see that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.400
 each block is bringing 5,000 10,000 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.290
 Sao paulo people are very big folks 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 Let's do in the other neighborhoods too. 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 because more than 100 registered blocks 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.979
 to pass our narrow streets is not 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.560
 simply not feasible 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.130
 the carnival in São Paulo counted this year 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.040
 with 200 blocks of street good part of them 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.950
 passed by the streets of the village madalena 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.090
 for next year 100 associations already 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.280
 are entered 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.299
 the promise of the city hall is that until the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 the end of this year is already 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.490
 carnival regulation 2015 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.640
 The changes aim to improve the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.939
 and improve mobility but this is 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.430
 just the fear of those who live here 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.729
 more organization would mean more 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.150
 investments more people on the streets and more 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 therefore another request from the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.780
 alive 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.720
 is so the party does not extend through the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.239
 whole month was a few days event 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.870
 now we see is a carnival one month 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.019
 it's medium 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.370
 this is by decree of the secretary of the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.190
 São Paulo culture 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.620
 but there are also those who argue that the revelry 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.370
 street can not stop 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 the street carnival is a practice that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.319
 ancient times occurred much later with 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 a little off and now it's coming back to me 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.250
 I think street carnival has been 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.019
 encouraged and organized so that it 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.700
 occurs in the best possible way in 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.549
 how people keep complaining about 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.799
 too much of these things is not part of 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.569
 Anywhere in Brazil you go has 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.569
 a carnival has a party
