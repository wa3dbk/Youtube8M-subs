00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
right left right 16s all the way just

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.050

so what I sometimes do is to play God
with<00:01:36.790> strokes<00:01:37.090> instead<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.810> going<00:01:38.020> right<00:01:38.590> left

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
with strokes instead of going right left

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.850 
with strokes instead of going right left
right<00:01:39.189> left<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.729> go<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:41.170> faster<00:01:41.530> anything

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860

still just six things but I go to rights
and<00:01:44.470> two<00:01:44.710> left's<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> let's<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and two left's so let's just do the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.919 
and two left's so let's just do the
alternating<00:01:48.939> pattern<00:01:49.119> first<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.600> know<00:01:49.720> right

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
left right left all the way around then

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.080 
left right left all the way around then
do<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.390> double<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.130> can<00:01:54.280> play<00:01:54.429> it<00:01:54.610> properly

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
do the double if I can play it properly

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.740 
do the double if I can play it properly
it<00:01:55.390> sounds<00:01:55.960> exactly<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.710> same<00:02:03.569> maybe<00:02:04.569> it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
it sounds exactly the same maybe it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.139 
it sounds exactly the same maybe it
feels<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.080> little<00:02:05.259> different<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:07.000> good

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
feels a little different but the good

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.229 
feels a little different but the good
thing<00:02:07.179> about<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.780> groove<00:02:08.080> or<00:02:09.009> dis<00:02:09.369> sticking

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
your right hand on the hi Tom I do that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.190 
your right hand on the hi Tom I do that
a<00:02:35.500> lot<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.769> times<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.220> looks<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.760> play

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130 

and<00:02:41.970> that's<00:02:42.970> basically<00:02:43.240> what<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.050> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and that's basically what you do if you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.500 
and that's basically what you do if you
play<00:02:44.350> eighth<00:02:44.590> notes<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.400> would<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:49.360> now

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510

it's<00:02:49.750> doubles<00:02:50.140> always<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:55.569> our<00:02:55.720> improve<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
it's doubles always in our improve it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.780 
it's doubles always in our improve it
would<00:02:56.770> sound<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.400> I'll<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.490> do

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
would sound like this so I'll just do

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.730 
would sound like this so I'll just do
the<00:02:57.820> regular<00:02:57.970> around<00:02:58.600> first<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.140> then<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
the regular around first and then the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.570 
the regular around first and then the
virus<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:02.140> one<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.830> with

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
virus and then that one with there with

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:26.729 
virus and then that one with there with
the<00:03:03.730> double<00:03:04.120> thing<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> top

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:34.390 

so<00:03:28.480> what<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> like<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.709> do<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.890> snare

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
like that's one B and up and then you do

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.490 
like that's one B and up and then you do
the<00:05:59.880> reverse<00:06:00.270> thing<00:06:00.569> like<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:02.400> e<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:03.360> that<00:06:04.110> so

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
the reverse thing like to e and that so

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:22.570
