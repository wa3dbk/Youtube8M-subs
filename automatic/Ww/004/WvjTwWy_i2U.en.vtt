00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
processor as the s3 so you still get in

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.789 
processor as the s3 so you still get in
that<00:03:51.079> dual-core<00:03:51.560> 1.5<00:03:52.480> Krait<00:03:53.480> processor<00:03:53.799> very

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
that dual-core 1.5 Krait processor very

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.530 
that dual-core 1.5 Krait processor very
quick<00:03:55.099> but<00:03:55.340> only<00:03:55.579> like<00:03:55.669> i<00:03:55.819> said<00:03:55.970> one<00:03:56.150> gigabyte

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
quick but only like i said one gigabyte

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.330 
quick but only like i said one gigabyte
of<00:03:56.690> ram<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:56.989> it's<00:03:57.109> not<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.530> fast<00:03:58.010> as<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:59.359> s3<00:03:59.840> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
of ram so it's not as fast as the s3 and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.879 
of ram so it's not as fast as the s3 and
like<00:04:01.340> i<00:04:01.400> said<00:04:01.459> 199<00:04:02.090> on<00:04:02.329> a<00:04:03.230> two-year<00:04:03.590> probably
