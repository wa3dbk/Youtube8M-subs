really<00:01:04.920> fun<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> play<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.600> to

rewatching myself play controlling all

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.470 
rewatching myself play controlling all
the<00:01:24.800> units<00:01:25.160> I<00:01:25.400> don't<00:01:25.670> know<00:01:25.760> everything<00:01:26.390> in

the units I don't know everything in
brood<00:01:26.630> war<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:26.990> seems<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.200> lot<00:01:27.350> more

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
brood war just seems a lot more

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.470 
brood war just seems a lot more
rewarding<00:01:28.040> every<00:01:28.520> time<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.790> want<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.030> game<00:01:29.210> it

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
rewarding every time you want a game it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.510 
rewarding every time you want a game it
felt<00:01:29.750> like<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.530> was<00:01:30.650> all<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:31.040> your<00:01:31.160> efforts

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
felt like it was all of your efforts

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.630 
felt like it was all of your efforts
during<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.000> game<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:33.200> ended<00:01:33.470> up<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.800> lead<00:01:34.520> it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
during the game the ended up to lead it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480 
during the game the ended up to lead it
up<00:01:34.760> light<00:01:35.090> up<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:35.540> winning<00:01:36.050> that<00:01:36.080> game<00:01:36.490> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
up light up to you winning that game so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.270 
up light up to you winning that game so
I<00:01:37.520> think<00:01:37.910> reward<00:01:38.570> was<00:01:38.870> in<00:01:39.170> fact<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.770> more

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
I think reward was in fact a more

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.890 
I think reward was in fact a more
enjoyable<00:01:40.400> game<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.300> not<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:41.600> say<00:01:41.750> that

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
enjoyable game that's not to say that

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.260 
enjoyable game that's not to say that
starcraft<00:01:42.230> 2<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.770> not<00:01:42.950> fun<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:43.220> itself<00:01:43.790> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
starcraft 2 is not fun in itself and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.100 
starcraft 2 is not fun in itself and
actually<00:01:44.930> I<00:01:45.200> think<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.980> both<00:01:46.730> games<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
actually I think that both games the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.690 
actually I think that both games the
most<00:01:48.380> fun<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:49.580> people<00:01:50.510> have<00:01:50.750> is<00:01:51.520> just<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
most fun that people have is just the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.350 
most fun that people have is just the
act<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.000> improving<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.770> up<00:01:55.000> higher<00:01:56.000> on

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
act of improving and going up higher on

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.310 
act of improving and going up higher on
the<00:01:56.690> ladder<00:01:57.370> etc<00:01:58.370> so

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
the ladder etc so

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.040 
the ladder etc so
it's<00:02:00.830> really<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.520> mean<00:02:02.330> like<00:02:02.510> it's<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.780> stressful

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's really I mean like it's a stressful

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.680 
it's really I mean like it's a stressful
game<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.860> compared<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.760> league<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.000> legends<00:02:05.360> or

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
game so compared to league of legends or

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.390 
game so compared to league of legends or

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
also very committed the alleged stew but

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.150 
also very committed the alleged stew but
those<00:02:11.540> games<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> lot<00:02:12.320> more<00:02:12.350> casual<00:02:12.980> if

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
those games are a lot more casual if

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.770 
those games are a lot more casual if
you're<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> casual<00:02:13.670> player<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.390> you're<00:02:14.540> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you're a casual player but if you're a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.180 
you're a casual player but if you're a
starcraft<00:02:15.230> there<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.680> actually<00:02:15.980> really

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
starcraft there it's actually really

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.620 
starcraft there it's actually really
really<00:02:16.370> stressful<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.060> game<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:17.510> it's

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
really stressful of the game so it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.870 
really stressful of the game so it's
actually<00:02:17.720> playing<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.740> game<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:19.430> that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
actually playing the game is not that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.260 
actually playing the game is not that
fun<00:02:20.860> but<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.100> active<00:02:22.490> improving<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
fun but just active improving and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.920 
fun but just active improving and
everything<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> most<00:02:24.320> fun<00:02:25.930> and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
everything I think is the most fun and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.690 
everything I think is the most fun and
then<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.530> some<00:02:27.680> other<00:02:27.800> things<00:02:28.160> about<00:02:28.400> game

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
then just some other things about game

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.960 
then just some other things about game
design<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.480> think<00:02:29.720> blizzard<00:02:30.970> implemented

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
design but I think blizzard implemented

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.350 
design but I think blizzard implemented
in<00:02:32.180> starcraft<00:02:32.600> 2<00:02:33.190> which<00:02:34.190> makes<00:02:34.520> starcraft<00:02:35.209> 2<00:02:35.330> a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
in starcraft 2 which makes starcraft 2 a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.199 
in starcraft 2 which makes starcraft 2 a
little<00:02:35.600> bit<00:02:35.690> less<00:02:35.870> fun<00:02:36.140> than<00:02:36.170> brood<00:02:36.500> war<00:02:37.209> for

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
little bit less fun than brood war for

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.750 
little bit less fun than brood war for
example<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.950> fact<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.220> all<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> units

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
example the fact that all the units

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.420 
example the fact that all the units
clump<00:02:41.090> together<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.950> obviously<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.190> hockey

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
clump together and obviously one hockey

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.040 
clump together and obviously one hockey
and<00:02:43.640> we'll<00:02:43.820> take<00:02:43.970> Poli<00:02:44.209> Sci<00:02:44.390> close<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.840> skills

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
and we'll take Poli Sci close the skills

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.620 
and we'll take Poli Sci close the skills
are<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.410> stealing<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.830> lot<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.360> fact<00:02:47.570> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
are you stealing a lot but the fact that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.110 
are you stealing a lot but the fact that
the<00:02:47.750> units<00:02:48.050> come<00:02:48.230> together<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.880> really

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the units come together is really really

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.509 
the units come together is really really
bad<00:02:50.209> for<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> game<00:02:50.780> because<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.350> means<00:02:51.519> any

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
bad for the game because it means any

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.090 
bad for the game because it means any
type<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:52.880> strong<00:02:53.510> spells<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.830> splash

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
type of strong spells that do splash

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.740 
type of strong spells that do splash
damage<00:02:55.370> or<00:02:55.640> whatever<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.300> be<00:02:56.360> really

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
damage or whatever have to be really

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.229 
damage or whatever have to be really
really<00:02:56.870> nerve<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.769> see<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.519> say

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
really nerve and you can see that in say

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.170 
really nerve and you can see that in say
the<00:02:59.269> storm<00:03:00.070> nerves<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.400> happen<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.760> lot<00:03:01.790> in

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the storm nerves that happen a lot in

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.660 
the storm nerves that happen a lot in
early<00:03:02.570> beta<00:03:02.980> there's<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.040> lot<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.220> nerves<00:03:04.489> on

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
early beta there's a lot of nerves on

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.540 
early beta there's a lot of nerves on
those

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
those

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.190 
those
there<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.940> really<00:03:08.360> really<00:03:08.720> good<00:03:08.930> thread

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
there was this really really good thread

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.740 
there was this really really good thread
on<00:03:09.470> Team<00:03:09.860> Liquid<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.210> of<00:03:11.240> my<00:03:11.360> favorites

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
on Team Liquid it is one of my favorites

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.990 
on Team Liquid it is one of my favorites
actually<00:03:11.960> record<00:03:12.500> regarding<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.820> subject

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
actually record regarding this subject

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500 
actually record regarding this subject
and<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:15.230> called<00:03:15.500> dynamic<00:03:16.310> unit<00:03:17.000> movements

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
and it's called dynamic unit movements

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.040 
and it's called dynamic unit movements
and<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.190> idea<00:03:19.190> behind<00:03:19.460> it<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.630> sort<00:03:20.960> of

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
and the idea behind it is it sort of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.230 
and the idea behind it is it sort of
makes<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> passing<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:22.070> starcraft<00:03:22.970> 2<00:03:23.210> a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
makes the passing of starcraft 2 a

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.450 
makes the passing of starcraft 2 a
little<00:03:23.840> bit<00:03:23.960> more<00:03:24.110> similar<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.710> include<00:03:25.190> war

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
little bit more similar to include war

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.720 
little bit more similar to include war
although<00:03:26.000> not<00:03:26.270> as<00:03:26.390> dumb<00:03:26.600> but<00:03:27.440> basically<00:03:28.310> units

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
although not as dumb but basically units

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.820 
although not as dumb but basically units
spread<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.360> more<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:33.170> has<00:03:33.440> several

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
spread out more and it has several

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.290 
spread out more and it has several
several<00:03:34.130> good<00:03:34.970> benefits<00:03:35.420> for<00:03:36.080> example<00:03:37.300> army

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
several good benefits for example army

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.120 
several good benefits for example army
sizes<00:03:38.630> just<00:03:38.660> look<00:03:39.080> way<00:03:39.290> bigger<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:39.800> right

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
sizes just look way bigger because right

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.540 
sizes just look way bigger because right
now<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.550> starcraft<00:03:41.030> two<00:03:42.250> armies<00:03:43.250> actually

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
now in starcraft two armies actually

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.140 
now in starcraft two armies actually
look<00:03:43.670> really<00:03:43.700> really<00:03:44.300> small<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:46.820> doesn't

thoughts on the this topic here but both

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.649 
thoughts on the this topic here but both

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
and I definitely enjoyed both but I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.520 
and I definitely enjoyed both but I
might<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.439> might<00:04:48.120> think<00:04:49.120> about<00:04:49.300> doing<00:04:49.810> some

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
might I might think about doing some

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.459

more food or the future sometime just
for<00:04:53.620> fun<00:04:53.740> because<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.669> remember<00:04:55.120> having<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.139> lot

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319
