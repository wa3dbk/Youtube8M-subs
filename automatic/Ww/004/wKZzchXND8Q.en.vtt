memory<00:00:15.389> card<00:00:15.770> this<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:17.280> replace<00:00:17.640> your<00:00:17.850> vmu

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
memory card this can replace your vmu

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.630 
memory card this can replace your vmu
because<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> has<00:00:19.260> four<00:00:19.740> times<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.220> much<00:00:20.340> space

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
because it has four times as much space

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.990 
because it has four times as much space
but<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.110> does<00:00:22.290> not<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.770> a<00:00:22.830> screen<00:00:23.160> which<00:00:23.820> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
but it does not have a screen which is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.320 
but it does not have a screen which is
unfortunate<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.200> it's<00:00:25.350> well-made<00:00:26.330> basically

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
unfortunate but it's well-made basically

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.580 
unfortunate but it's well-made basically
the<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.600> would<00:00:27.690> work<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.110> you'd<00:00:28.260> plug<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the way it would work is you'd plug it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
the way it would work is you'd plug it
in<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.710> controller<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.970> each<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.870> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
in your controller and you each one of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
in your controller and you each one of
these<00:00:31.110> lights<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.740> would<00:00:31.890> light<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.070> each

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
these lights these would light up each

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.200 
these lights these would light up each
one<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.759> orange

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one would be orange

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
one would be orange
it<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.539> also<00:00:33.780> light<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.019> down<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.670> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
it would also light up down there and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
it would also light up down there and
the<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.179> one<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:36.929> memory

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the first one would be your first memory

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
the first one would be your first memory
card<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:37.800> once<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.949> was<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.460> could

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
card and then once that was up you could

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
card and then once that was up you could
just<00:00:38.609> push<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> button<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> your

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
just push this button and go to your

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
just push this button and go to your
second<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.589> third<00:00:40.949> or<00:00:41.129> fourth<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.909> doesn't

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
second or third or fourth or it doesn't

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.009 
second or third or fourth or it doesn't
even<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.390> filled<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.989> just

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
even have to be filled up you can just

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.899 
even have to be filled up you can just
move<00:00:43.260> around<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.609> put<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
move around it's not like you put this

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:45.829 
move around it's not like you put this
in<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.269> of<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.359> sudden<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.659> eight

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.239 
in and all of a sudden you have eight
you<00:00:46.109> know<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.319> sorry<00:00:46.559> four<00:00:46.769> times<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.159> much

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
space you have just basically four cards

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.349 
space you have just basically four cards
on<00:00:51.359> one<00:00:52.079> card<00:00:52.499> our<00:00:53.190> willing<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.760> plastic

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
on one card our willing one plastic

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.910 
on one card our willing one plastic
shell<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> were<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.499> I<00:00:55.589> said<00:00:55.649> there's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
shell as it were but like I said there's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
shell as it were but like I said there's
no<00:00:56.039> screen<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.429> stuff<00:00:56.609> so<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:56.969> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
no screen and stuff so that's kind of a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
no screen and stuff so that's kind of a
loss<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.949> plug<00:00:59.159> it<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.210> want

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
loss you can plug it in here if you want

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
loss you can plug it in here if you want
so<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.229> will<00:01:01.440> light<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.800> during<00:01:02.069> play<00:01:02.370> but

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so those will light up during play but

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.350 
so those will light up during play but

here<00:01:21.229> anyway<00:01:22.229> here's<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> compared<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.369> BM

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
here anyway here's it compared to a BM

you read in case you're curious no this

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.289 
you read in case you're curious no this
does<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.399> fit<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.119> little

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
does not fit because there's this little

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
does not fit because there's this little
plastic<00:01:30.689> tab<00:01:30.899> thing<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:32.399> would<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.609> cool<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
plastic tab thing that would be cool to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.050 
plastic tab thing that would be cool to
have<00:01:33.090> four<00:01:33.390> times<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.960> memory<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.649> this

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
have four times as much memory on this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.910 
have four times as much memory on this
they<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.359> that<00:01:36.539> for<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.409> stop<00:01:37.890> you

for some reason oh yeah here's its box

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
for some reason oh yeah here's its box
as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.859> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> box<00:01:44.869> boxes<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.020> cool

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
as you can see it's a box boxes are cool

as you can see it's a box boxes are cool
the<00:01:46.829> only<00:01:47.219> memory<00:01:47.490> card<00:01:47.789> you'll<00:01:47.969> ever<00:01:48.119> need

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
the only memory card you'll ever need

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.090 
the only memory card you'll ever need
that's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.590> lie

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that's a lie

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
that's a lie
because<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> plus<00:01:51.479> others<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because I have this one plus others I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.599 
because I have this one plus others I
didn't<00:01:52.829> need<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.340> wouldn't<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.670> them

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
didn't need them I wouldn't have them

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.469 
didn't need them I wouldn't have them
yeah<00:01:57.799> hmm<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.549> used<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> tandem<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.359> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
yeah hmm it can be used in tandem with a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
yeah hmm it can be used in tandem with a
VM<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.950> well<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.039> I<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.249> proved<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.729> can't

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
VM you well as I just proved you can't

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.819 
VM you well as I just proved you can't
actually<00:02:03.090> connect<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.749> to<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> VM<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.679> that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
actually connect it to a VM you so that

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.499 
actually connect it to a VM you so that
can't<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.249> they<00:02:05.369> mean<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.329> they're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
can't be what they mean so they're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.290 
can't be what they mean so they're
basically<00:02:06.630> saying<00:02:06.929> that<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> put<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
basically saying that when you put it in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.210 
basically saying that when you put it in
your<00:02:09.450> controller<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.289> put<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> VM<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
your controller and put a VM you and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.150 
your controller and put a VM you and
your<00:02:11.340> controller<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:12.239> won't<00:02:12.420> fight

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
your controller they won't fight

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.490 
your controller they won't fight
I<00:02:14.190> mean<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.670> guess<00:02:15.540> that's<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:16.050> must<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.350> what

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I mean I guess that's that must be what

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.660 
I mean I guess that's that must be what
they<00:02:16.590> mean<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> can't<00:02:17.220> connect<00:02:17.550> them

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
they mean because you can't connect them

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.890 
they mean because you can't connect them
I<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.790> showed<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.980> yeah<00:02:19.980> let's<00:02:20.310> hear

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the way to go this is good but then

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.090 
the way to go this is good but then
again<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:52.230> don't<00:02:52.320> really<00:02:52.440> need<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
again you don't really need this you

again you don't really need this you
should<00:02:53.250> could<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> muse<00:02:53.730> they're<00:02:53.970> cheap

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
should could be a muse they're cheap

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.540 
should could be a muse they're cheap
easy<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.080> get<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.650> screen<00:02:55.920> back

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
easy to get and you have the screen back

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.940 
easy to get and you have the screen back
then<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.000> kind<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.300> made<00:02:57.450> sense<00:02:57.950> because

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
then this kind of made sense because

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.220 
then this kind of made sense because
then<00:02:59.220> you'd<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.490> space<00:02:59.760> or<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.450> don't<00:03:01.110> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
then you'd have space or I don't know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.340 
then you'd have space or I don't know
you<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.590> need<00:03:01.800> space<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:03.690> taking<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> look<00:03:04.260> at
