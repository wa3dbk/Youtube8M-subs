it's<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.080> I<00:05:39.110> think<00:05:39.289> it's<00:05:39.530> incremental<00:05:39.889> things

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
it's so I think it's incremental things

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.379 
it's so I think it's incremental things
like<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:40.639> so<00:05:40.699> they're<00:05:40.940> going<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.180> it

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
like this so they're going to it

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.089 
like this so they're going to it
certainly<00:05:41.900> damaging<00:05:42.440> whether<00:05:42.800> this<00:05:42.949> in

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
certainly damaging whether this in

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.529 
certainly damaging whether this in
itself<00:05:43.550> is<00:05:43.729> going<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:43.969> be<00:05:44.060> sufficiently

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
itself is going to be sufficiently

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.730 
itself is going to be sufficiently
damaging<00:05:44.900> but<00:05:44.990> it's<00:05:45.110> certainly<00:05:45.229> damaging

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
damaging but it's certainly damaging

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.700 
damaging but it's certainly damaging
