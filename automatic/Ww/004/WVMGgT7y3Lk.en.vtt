way<00:03:22.020> out<00:03:22.050> kind<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.739> push<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.790> bit<00:03:24.150> so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
way out kind of push in a little bit so

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.990 
way out kind of push in a little bit so
it's<00:03:25.530> definitely<00:03:25.890> got<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.069> be<00:03:26.700> aware<00:03:26.849> I'm

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
it's definitely got to be aware I'm

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.330 
it's definitely got to be aware I'm
trying<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.360> pick<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.650> rut<00:03:28.650> that's<00:03:28.860> not<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.160> deep

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
trying to pick a rut that's not as deep

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.330 
trying to pick a rut that's not as deep
and<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.790> little<00:03:30.420> bit<00:03:30.510> flatter<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.920> about

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and a little bit flatter so just about

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.130 
and a little bit flatter so just about
lime<00:03:32.610> choice<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.840> definitely

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
lime choice and I think it's definitely

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.470 
lime choice and I think it's definitely

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.640 
ended up p11 or something like that as
well<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:55.060> about<00:04:56.060> normal<00:04:56.479> just<00:04:56.780> go<00:04:57.350> out<00:04:57.470> there
