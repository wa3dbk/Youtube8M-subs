it's very expensive to do individual
workouts<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.409> teams<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.920> interested<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
workouts and if teams are interested in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.770 
workouts and if teams are interested in
somebody<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.420> bring<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.689> along

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
somebody then they can bring them along

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.499 
somebody then they can bring them along
and<00:01:37.200> probably<00:01:37.530> work<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.509> further

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and probably work them out then further

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.700 
and probably work them out then further
if<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.840> feel<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> need<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.619> they'll

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
if they feel the need to and they'll

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.840 
if they feel the need to and they'll
definitely<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.100> their<00:01:41.220> own<00:01:41.250> physicals<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
definitely do their own physicals and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.050 
definitely do their own physicals and
stuff<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:43.130> they're<00:01:44.130> saying<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.759> hundred

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
stuff but they're saying about a hundred

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.590 
stuff but they're saying about a hundred
free<00:01:45.479> agents<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.930> expected<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.420> think

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
free agents as expected and I think

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.819 
free agents as expected and I think
that's<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:48.990> awesome<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.590> could<00:01:49.710> have

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that's really awesome you could have

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.819 
that's really awesome you could have
