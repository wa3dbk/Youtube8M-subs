00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
things that's first learned is foliage

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.520 
things that's first learned is foliage
okay<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.630> same<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.140> true<00:04:07.170> with

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
okay and that's the same is true with

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.310 
okay and that's the same is true with
any<00:04:07.710> perennial<00:04:08.310> you'll<00:04:08.540> you'll<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.020> short

any perennial you'll you'll have a short
bloom<00:04:10.620> period<00:04:10.860> but<00:04:11.220> you'll<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.520> a<00:04:11.580> long

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850

period foliage so you want to learn how
to<00:04:14.310> contrast<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.270> group<00:04:15.510> foliage<00:04:16.130> probably

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
to contrast and group foliage probably
