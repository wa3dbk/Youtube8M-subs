00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
bad so here he's pushing on my flank and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
bad so here he's pushing on my flank and
all<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:45.149> hold<00:01:45.360> them

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
all I'm going to do is just hold them

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
all I'm going to do is just hold them
off<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> move<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:46.920> troops<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.640> going

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
off so I move some troops and I'm going

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
off so I move some troops and I'm going
to<00:01:47.820> redirect<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.329> artillery<00:01:48.570> fire<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to redirect my artillery fire to just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
to redirect my artillery fire to just
hold<00:01:49.560> his<00:01:49.799> men<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> again<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> unit

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
hold his men off and again I have a unit

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.929 
hold his men off and again I have a unit
of<00:01:51.720> land<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.079> shoots<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.640> they're

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
of land and shoots in here so they're

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.389 
of land and shoots in here so they're
going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:55.049> able<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> fire<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.710> his<00:01:55.860> infantry

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
going to be able to fire at his infantry

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.910 
going to be able to fire at his infantry
from<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> great<00:01:57.060> range<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
from a great range and that's going to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
from a great range and that's going to
force<00:01:59.130> him<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> make<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> attack<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.329> give<00:02:00.600> me

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
force him to make the attack and give me

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.709 
force him to make the attack and give me
that<00:02:01.170> advantage<00:02:01.640> now<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:03.060> opponent<00:02:03.149> did<00:02:03.570> not

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that advantage now my opponent did not

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.069 
that advantage now my opponent did not
bring<00:02:03.960> any<00:02:04.079> cavalry<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.790> i

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
bring any cavalry and because of this i

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.290 
bring any cavalry and because of this i
needed<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.229> push<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.619> advantage<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.879> i<00:02:08.910> charged

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
needed to push my advantage so i charged

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.220 
needed to push my advantage so i charged
my<00:02:09.390> cavalry<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.080> disrupt<00:02:10.470> his<00:02:10.619> men

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
my cavalry in to disrupt his men

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.320 
my cavalry in to disrupt his men
and<00:02:11.800> he<00:02:12.220> doesn't<00:02:12.489> react<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.879> time<00:02:12.909> because

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and he doesn't react in time because

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
and he doesn't react in time because
he's<00:02:13.480> focused<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.080> other<00:02:14.200> flank<00:02:14.379> where

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
he's focused on the other flank where

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.460 
he's focused on the other flank where
he's<00:02:15.340> making<00:02:15.640> flank<00:02:15.879> movement<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.080> although

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
he's making flank movement so although

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.619 
he's making flank movement so although
he<00:02:17.739> started<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.129> outflank<00:02:18.489> me<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:19.060> his<00:02:19.420> right

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
he started to outflank me on his right

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.320 
he started to outflank me on his right
flank<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.200> started<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.099> out<00:02:21.190> flank<00:02:21.459> him<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:22.060> my

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
flank I started to out flank him on my

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.509 
flank I started to out flank him on my
right<00:02:22.540> flank<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.709> sometimes<00:02:23.980> when<00:02:24.370> your

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
right flank so sometimes when your

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.369 
right flank so sometimes when your
opponent<00:02:24.879> begins<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> flank<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.989> counter

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
opponent begins to flank you can counter

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.380 
opponent begins to flank you can counter
flank<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.159> because<00:02:27.459> they<00:02:27.549> had<00:02:27.700> my<00:02:27.819> cavalry<00:02:28.239> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
flank and because they had my cavalry to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.869 
flank and because they had my cavalry to
run<00:02:28.629> distraction<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.470> was<00:02:30.220> able<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.610> make<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
run distraction I was able to make it

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.869 
run distraction I was able to make it
more<00:02:31.000> effective<00:02:31.299> flanking<00:02:31.930> maneuver<00:02:32.349> and

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
more effective flanking maneuver and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.390 
more effective flanking maneuver and

that's pretty interesting to me that I

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.070 
that's pretty interesting to me that I
bring<00:04:05.470> some<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.829> lowest<00:04:05.980> quality<00:04:06.280> units

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.020 
one of the things I like about medium
funds<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.370> gives<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.940> ability

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
funds is that it gives you the ability

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.290 
funds is that it gives you the ability
