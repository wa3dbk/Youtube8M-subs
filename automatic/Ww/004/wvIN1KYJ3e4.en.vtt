00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
 E 'strong e'to 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Already... 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
 I come in a "bacano" romance 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 Already... 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 Pa 'to' the people who follow the Lester 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Already... 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 In dubstep mambo metal 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Already... 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 And featuring a "montra" there 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
 You ere 'my little piece' of earth 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 Where I can sow 'dream' that do not wake up 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260
 Your 'hand' is palm tree 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.620
 Your 'fruit' are water and although you have to take 'a peel 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.880
 I want to stay 'with you 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.580
 Although I stayed to 'life ra'cándome my navel 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.040
 I know that you do not have 'much pa' da ' 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.660
 But with what you have 'gives me pa' illusion ' 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 And even if I leave, I have to go back. ' 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.600
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.560
 Préndeme like the Sun 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.840
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.040
 Hold my heart 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.300
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.480
 Préndeme like the Sun 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.960
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.820
 Hold my heart 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.940
 And although with you one does not know 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.640
 What one goes to dinner ', if e' with bread or with casabe 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.080
 Here nobody has died of hunger 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.740
 Behind any brown door there is a café 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.640
 And if the 'little stick' does not fall, there is mountain 'de má' 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.740
 Malecón pa 'mira', grama 'pa' forget ' 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.040
 I do not have na 'pa' regala'te 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.600
 I made it up to 'the' day 'for your la'o I'm left 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.720
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 Préndeme like the Sun 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.840
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.140
 Hold my heart 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.480
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 Préndeme like the Sun 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.900
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.900
 Hold my heart 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
 Métele flow, Popokartépobut! 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.740
 I know that there are more 'paíse' 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.000
 But none like you, none like you 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.040
 What e 'what? 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 Préndeme like the Sun 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.620
 Turn me on! Turn me on! 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.140
 Hold my heart 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.740
 Throw him cachimbo! 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.240
 Na '... 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.860
 He put his hand in the Lester 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.160
 Already...
