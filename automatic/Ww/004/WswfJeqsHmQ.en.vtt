00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
tradition to have a model and I always

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.820 
tradition to have a model and I always

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
not have an athlete and so it all

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.550 
not have an athlete and so it all
started<00:03:03.690> from<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.260> didn't<00:03:04.470> really

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
started from there and I didn't really

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
started from there and I didn't really
expect<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.280> pictures<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.209> how<00:03:06.420> they

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
expect the pictures to get out how they

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.090 
expect the pictures to get out how they
did<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.380> was<00:03:08.070> excited<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> poster<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
did but I was excited to the poster and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
did but I was excited to the poster and
keep<00:03:11.100> bringing<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> tradition<00:03:12.239> instead<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
keep bringing the tradition instead of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.460 
keep bringing the tradition instead of
having<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.050> model<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.560> an<00:03:13.739> athletic<00:03:14.670> model<00:03:15.000> so

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
having a model have an athletic model so

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.260
