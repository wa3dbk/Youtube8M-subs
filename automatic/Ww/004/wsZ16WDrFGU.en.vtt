00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
chunky we like to have it smooth so we

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.980 
chunky we like to have it smooth so we
put<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.859> in<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.100> blender<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.719> already

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
put it in the blender and so I already

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.999 
put it in the blender and so I already
did<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:32.979> then<00:01:33.759> add<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.329> together<00:01:34.479> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
did that and then add that together and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.749 
did that and then add that together and
basically<00:01:36.009> just<00:01:36.340> warm<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:37.030> up<00:01:37.329> until<00:01:37.780> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
basically just warm this up until it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.969 
basically just warm this up until it's
pretty<00:01:39.759> much<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> boil<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.810> once<00:01:41.799> the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
pretty much to a boil so once the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.370 
pretty much to a boil so once the
chicken<00:01:42.159> broth<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.789> salsa<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.630> nice<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.229> hot

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
chicken broth and salsa is nice and hot

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.349 
chicken broth and salsa is nice and hot
you're<00:01:44.560> going<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.740> want<00:01:44.859> to<00:01:44.950> add<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.429> rice<00:01:45.969> and

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
you're going to want to add the rice and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.749 
you're going to want to add the rice and
pretty<00:01:47.350> much<00:01:47.500> cook<00:01:47.829> it<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.310> way<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
pretty much cook it the way the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.609 
pretty much cook it the way the
direction<00:01:49.090> stays<00:01:49.450> for<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.750> rice<00:01:49.929> so<00:01:50.439> if

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
direction stays for the rice so if

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.039 
direction stays for the rice so if
you're<00:01:50.770> using<00:01:51.119> instant<00:01:52.119> rights<00:01:52.360> don't<00:01:52.659> take

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
you're using instant rights don't take

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.690 
you're using instant rights don't take
like<00:01:53.200> five<00:01:53.500> minutes<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:56.549> jasmine<00:01:57.549> rice

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
like five minutes I have jasmine rice

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.130 
like five minutes I have jasmine rice
and<00:01:57.969> I<00:01:58.030> think<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.360> cooking<00:01:58.659> directions<00:01:58.840> say

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and I think the cooking directions say

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.319 
and I think the cooking directions say
like<00:01:59.289> 15<00:01:59.709> or<00:01:59.739> 20<00:02:00.189> minutes<00:02:00.219> so<00:02:01.060> I'm<00:02:01.119> just<00:02:01.209> going

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
like 15 or 20 minutes so I'm just going

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.240 
like 15 or 20 minutes so I'm just going
to<00:02:01.390> let<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:01.719> simmer<00:02:02.079> on<00:02:02.409> low<00:02:03.959> for<00:02:04.959> 15<00:02:05.739> or<00:02:05.770> 20

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
to let this simmer on low for 15 or 20

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.559 
to let this simmer on low for 15 or 20
minutes<00:02:06.280> or<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:08.489> I'm<00:02:09.489> also<00:02:09.849> going<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.329> add

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
minutes or so and I'm also going to add

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.170
