00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.180

allocating<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.290> time<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:26.740> battled<00:01:27.070> in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
allocating the time that we battled in

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.240 
allocating the time that we battled in
last<00:01:27.369> time<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:29.380> croc<00:01:29.680> can<00:01:29.860> take<00:01:30.040> him

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
last time but I think croc can take him

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.190 
last time but I think croc can take him
even<00:01:30.369> though<00:01:30.610> he<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.000> weak<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.720> elekid

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
even though he is weak to elekid

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.960 
even though he is weak to elekid
electrical<00:01:32.950> attack<00:01:33.250> if<00:01:33.880> he<00:01:34.150> has<00:01:34.299> any<00:01:34.600> level<00:01:35.409> 7

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
electrical attack if he has any level 7

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.160 
electrical attack if he has any level 7
let's<00:01:36.970> keep<00:01:37.150> water<00:01:37.390> gunning<00:01:37.780> him<00:01:37.900> till<00:01:38.110> he

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
goes down all right there we go that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.910

we'll just scratch it we don't want a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.499 
we'll just scratch it we don't want a
water<00:01:50.770> gun<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.159> because<00:01:51.400> we<00:01:51.670> do<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.479> a

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
water gun it because we do not have a

type<00:01:52.780> advantage<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.460> actually<00:01:54.820> a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
type advantage it is actually a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.649 
type advantage it is actually a
disadvantage<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:57.070> right<00:01:57.250> yeah<00:01:58.210> he's<00:01:58.479> not

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
disadvantage all right yeah he's not

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.719 
disadvantage all right yeah he's not
gonna<00:01:58.840> hurt<00:01:59.020> us<00:01:59.170> very<00:01:59.259> much<00:01:59.650> just<00:02:00.549> keep
