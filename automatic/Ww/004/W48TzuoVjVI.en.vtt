00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hey hello people from the internet 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.189
 today you are going into a new trick 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.389
 teach you an SLR camera 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.000
 it's a trick that takes you whole 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.290
 cheap and very easy a macro 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.290
 can take pictures like this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.250
 and instead of having a lot of money 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.380
 you can also spend on a macro lens 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.820
 very easy just that launcher 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.279
 and pick it up the other way around 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.010
 so you get a cheap simple 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.440
 macrowland before i explain how 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.450
 I want you to do it exactly 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.300
 has to say it is not necessarily 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.239
 wise to remove your lens because 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.120
 your camera stands and grandfather 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.010
 well and all are lucky so you can 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.600
 santing coming can dust income and it 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.910
 you should really try to prevent 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.090
 it's not good for a camera like you 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.450
 for example sand or dust on the sensor 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.250
 so if you are going to do it care 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.880
 make sure you are in an environment with 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 few 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.750
 dust 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.610
 before you start you go 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.110
 of course think of which you have a photo 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.210
 want to make into the black mare 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.020
 take the macro photo and I have a moment 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.850
 simple 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.950
 50 cent took what you're doing is you 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.940
 him of course like I said and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.210
 you go under 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.660
 stop it and the disadvantage is that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.410
 So you constantly put your lens against your camera 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.390
 must adhere to 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.180
 and so you have to shoot that you can't 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.820
 you need as the two hands 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.260
 you can buy the special rings 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.210
 those are kind of that that between those 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.070
 things how diverse ring jacket from google 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.800
 and I 'm just going to get you there 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 turning that bit easier but me 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.369
 don't think it is necessary to be there 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 spend money on it 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.860
 unless it really likes it 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.290
 natural in friend's way 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.550
 if you have to shoot such a photo we have to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.710
 you the manual 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.690
 use manual mode since 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 your lens has no contact with your 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.130
 you can't use a camera too 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.660
 make aperture and what me 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.180
 I recommend that I arrive as quickly as possible 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.210
 set shutter speed because of course 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.090
 you must be very close to something is coming 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.070
 every every move becomes very bad 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.530
 perceived by your sensor that they too 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.239
 sand and see if you go through you 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.070
 feel fine ' look it is whole 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.900
 hard to also you you me then mint 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.780
 to find you really have to be very close 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.900
 must sit down and make sure you get that fast 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.209
 your shutter speed still uses aperture 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.260
 will be completely open so that we 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:40.269
 look at me so that those fucking are there 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.239
 from 3 point 5 and for the iso I use 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.950
 preferably as low as possible 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 you have a lot for that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.900
 need light but I notice most anyway 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 just a little more beautiful is a photo that I 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.870
 you know what you got fischeri 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.910
 can that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.650
 Gray what you get, we looked forward 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 keep it photoshop mark well i had to 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 so sentences 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.349
 ok well let's start the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.299
 settings that I will use is and 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.989
 shutter speed of a two hundredth 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.760
 second and an iso value of 800 this is 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.560
 not ideal but i have here in my 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.549
 room not very much light yourself 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.500
 the three 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.200
 outside of a flower with bright 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.109
 sunlight you can set this much higher 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.879
 and fortum errors I think just a little nicer 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.010
 just a bit sharper 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.769
 but start so i have to cam 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.720
 settings I can have had the lens 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:36.180
 a little bit of fall falls this correct 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.919
 in the right place and you can do that too 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.930
 nothing more with you can new focus you 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.599
 just have to move yourself with the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.340
 camera so eventually you will see that 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.549
 you here that that screen is in 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.549
 statue 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.900
 yes i have a good one i will never 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.640
 leave see the video 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.810
 well as you become so you can see 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.360
 that you actually have very few 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.400
 can be focused 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.950
 and that has to do with the aperture 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.360
 is so big that you have a very small one 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.579
 focus point it i find him 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.639
 yes of course nice if you like this one 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.109
 flower looks like from an insect 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.030
 but you just have to take it a little bit 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.889
 play what fun things are about 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.169
 to photograph 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.590
 a nice example is the later 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.180
 for winter and first ice on you on your window 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.110
 then you can handle the feel and spain 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.520
 adhere to this and vice versa so and 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.180
 then you can get beautiful ice crystals 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.180
 to photograph 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.039
 well i hope it will help you 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.840
 let let know and like this like 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.310
 doesn't matter i just want to be very happy 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.430
 feedback 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.259
 imagine suggestions for other tips 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.800
 or many more of these old tricks 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.560
 know 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.479
 let me hear yourself if you understand 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.210
 nothing about your camera you knew 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.560
 whether I will explain the camera first 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.960
 level 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.650
 something like a partly true and let me 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.110
 know 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.099
 think that many people have such a room 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.870
 but knowing that thing works so I go 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.259
 now without 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.259
 letter
