some<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> technical<00:01:52.890> aspects<00:01:53.520> behind

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
some of the technical aspects behind

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
some of the technical aspects behind
bringing<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.659> character<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> life<00:01:55.290> you're

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
bringing a character to life you're

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
bringing a character to life you're
going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> learn<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:55.740> rigging<00:01:56.340> what's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
going to learn about rigging what's

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.179 
going to learn about rigging what's
required<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.600> give<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.140> character<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.860> means

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
required to give the character the means

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.340 
required to give the character the means
of<00:01:59.520> coming<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> life<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.049> he<00:02:01.200> will

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of coming to life so that he will

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.190 
of coming to life so that he will
basically<00:02:02.250> provide<00:02:02.969> an<00:02:03.479> easy<00:02:03.750> means<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
basically provide an easy means of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
basically provide an easy means of
animation<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> way<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> take<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
animation it's like a way to take the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119 
animation it's like a way to take the
model<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.719> you've<00:02:06.899> constructed<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.770> turn

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
model that you've constructed and turn

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010 
model that you've constructed and turn
it<00:02:08.280> into<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.580> digital<00:02:08.879> puppet<00:02:09.569> how<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
it into a digital puppet how do you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.570 
it into a digital puppet how do you
throw<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> skeleton<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
throw a skeleton in it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
throw a skeleton in it
and<00:02:11.790> hook<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> wires<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.380> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and hook up all the wires you need to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.290

we're going to be able to paint all of

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.410 
we're going to be able to paint all of
our<00:03:49.920> objects<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.640> scene<00:03:50.790> once<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:51.180> these

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
our objects in the scene once all these

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.880 
our objects in the scene once all these
things<00:03:51.690> are<00:03:51.840> done<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.170> they're<00:03:52.290> done<00:03:52.440> inside

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
things are done and they're done inside

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.920 
things are done and they're done inside
of<00:03:53.040> Maya<00:03:53.250> then<00:03:53.910> we're<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.209> render<00:03:54.570> out

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
of Maya then we're going to render out

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.570 
of Maya then we're going to render out
our<00:03:55.290> images<00:03:55.830> that's<00:03:56.160> right<00:03:56.280> which<00:03:56.459> means

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
our images that's right which means

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.130 
our images that's right which means
we're<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.000> take<00:03:57.209> our<00:03:57.390> images<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.959> let

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
we're going to take our images and let

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.199 
we're going to take our images and let
Maya's<00:03:58.709> rendering<00:03:59.160> engine<00:03:59.489> calculate<00:04:00.090> how

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
Maya's rendering engine calculate how

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.910 
Maya's rendering engine calculate how
shadows<00:04:00.690> are<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.080> fall<00:04:01.320> we're

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
shadows are going to fall we're

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.680 
shadows are going to fall we're
specularity<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.940> going<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.330> appear<00:04:03.630> on

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
specularity is going to appear on

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020 
specularity is going to appear on
surfaces<00:04:04.440> when<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.280> light<00:04:05.430> needs<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.880> reflect

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
surfaces when the light needs to reflect

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.470 
surfaces when the light needs to reflect
refract<00:04:06.930> through<00:04:07.620> surfaces<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:09.120> other<00:04:09.299> words

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
refract through surfaces in other words

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.580 
refract through surfaces in other words
the<00:04:09.600> lights<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.019> been<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.440> give<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the lights can have been to give a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.770 
the lights can have been to give a
distorted<00:04:11.220> look<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:11.820> reflect<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.510> works

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
distorted look I like reflect that works

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.350 
distorted look I like reflect that works
reflect<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.709> refract<00:04:14.190> yeah<00:04:14.640> kind<00:04:15.299> of

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
reflect and refract yeah kind of

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.960 
reflect and refract yeah kind of
combined<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.019> two<00:04:16.140> yessum<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.280> anyways<00:04:17.729> we're

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
combined the two yessum so anyways we're

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.979 
combined the two yessum so anyways we're
going<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.150> be<00:04:18.209> taking<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.570> look<00:04:18.690> at<00:04:18.840> all<00:04:18.959> of

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
going to be taking a look at all of

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.990 
going to be taking a look at all of
these<00:04:19.200> things<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.680> rendering<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.520> going<00:04:20.940> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
these things and rendering is going to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.640 
these things and rendering is going to
be<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.270> final<00:04:21.720> step<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.140> lot<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.470> people

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
be that final step that a lot of people

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.440 
be that final step that a lot of people
who<00:04:23.039> are<00:04:23.130> just<00:04:23.280> getting<00:04:23.400> into<00:04:23.700> 3d<00:04:24.000> take<00:04:24.270> for

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
who are just getting into 3d take for

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.050 
who are just getting into 3d take for
granted

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
granted

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.370 
granted
yes<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.300> do<00:04:25.419> when<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.720> go<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.930> watch<00:04:26.169> The

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
yes they do when you go to watch The

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.080 
yes they do when you go to watch The
Incredibles<00:04:26.950> in<00:04:27.130> theatres<00:04:27.550> or<00:04:27.580> wherever<00:04:27.940> you

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
Incredibles in theatres or wherever you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.730 
Incredibles in theatres or wherever you
happen<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.169> as<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> 3d

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
happen to see it you see it as a 3d

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.650 
happen to see it you see it as a 3d
movie<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.310> that's<00:04:30.880> where<00:04:31.060> your<00:04:31.180> brain<00:04:31.360> cuts

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
movie and that's where your brain cuts

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.060 
movie and that's where your brain cuts
off<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.260> don't<00:04:32.410> realize<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.950> you're

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
off you don't realize that you're

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.159 
off you don't realize that you're
looking<00:04:33.400> at<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.610> two<00:04:33.940> dimensional<00:04:34.660> rendering

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
looking at a two dimensional rendering

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.990 
looking at a two dimensional rendering
of<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:35.410> three-dimensional<00:04:35.889> scene<00:04:36.639> that's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
of a three-dimensional scene that's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.520 
of a three-dimensional scene that's
right<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.419> so<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.750> very<00:04:37.930> last<00:04:38.139> step<00:04:38.350> is

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
right and so that very last step is

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.690 
right and so that very last step is
going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.770> be<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.040> render<00:04:39.520> this

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
going to be to render this

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.100 
going to be to render this
three-dimensional<00:04:40.330> scene<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.630> turn<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> into

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
three-dimensional scene to turn it into

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.780 
three-dimensional scene to turn it into
that<00:04:41.290> 2d<00:04:41.710> movie<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.220> your<00:04:42.340> audience<00:04:42.460> can

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
that 2d movie that your audience can

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.120 
that 2d movie that your audience can
watch<00:04:42.970> yep<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.990> that's<00:04:44.169> what<00:04:44.320> Maya<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.770> yeah

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
watch yep so that's what Maya is yeah

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.360 
watch yep so that's what Maya is yeah
Maya's<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.760> very<00:04:46.030> powerful<00:04:46.360> very<00:04:47.200> capable<00:04:47.800> very

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
Maya's a very powerful very capable very

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.510 
Maya's a very powerful very capable very
flexible<00:04:49.150> application<00:04:49.980> designed<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.280> allow<00:04:51.490> a

user to easily create 3d digital content

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.450 
user to easily create 3d digital content
that's<00:04:56.080> what<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.410> all<00:04:56.530> boils<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.980> together<00:04:57.130> and

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
that's what it all boils in together and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.060 
that's what it all boils in together and
throughout<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.479> course<00:04:58.840> throughout<00:04:59.560> many

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
throughout this course throughout many

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.460 
throughout this course throughout many
many<00:05:00.520> hours<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.479> are<00:05:01.510> approaching<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.260> guys

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
many hours that are approaching you guys

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.710 
many hours that are approaching you guys
many<00:05:03.100> hours<00:05:03.520> we're<00:05:03.820> going<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.240> learn<00:05:04.389> how<00:05:04.450> to

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
many hours we're going to learn how to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.360 
many hours we're going to learn how to
put<00:05:04.990> all<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.200> this<00:05:05.500> in<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.800> motion<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:06.310> that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
put all of this in the motion so that

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.060 
put all of this in the motion so that
you<00:05:06.550> guys<00:05:06.669> can<00:05:06.940> create<00:05:07.450> three<00:05:07.990> final<00:05:08.500> projects

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
you guys can create three final projects

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.240 
you guys can create three final projects
that<00:05:09.550> all<00:05:09.910> involve<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:11.200> creation<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:11.800> models

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
that all involve the creation of models

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.750 
that all involve the creation of models
painting<00:05:13.090> lighting<00:05:13.900> animation<00:05:14.770> effects<00:05:15.460> and

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
painting lighting animation effects and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.180 
painting lighting animation effects and
of<00:05:16.120> course<00:05:16.150> final<00:05:16.810> rendering<00:05:17.139> so<00:05:17.860> that's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
of course final rendering so that's

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.320 
of course final rendering so that's
pretty<00:05:18.370> much<00:05:18.490> going<00:05:18.639> to<00:05:18.700> wrap<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:18.910> up<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:19.240> this

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
pretty much going to wrap it up for this

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.139 
pretty much going to wrap it up for this
video<00:05:19.479> thanks<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.110> lot
