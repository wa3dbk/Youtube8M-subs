00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
really you know they were forced to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.960 
really you know they were forced to
contend<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.920> if<00:01:30.069> you<00:01:30.160> want<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.729> go<00:01:30.819> in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
contend with but if you want to go in

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.090 
contend with but if you want to go in
really<00:01:31.210> slow<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.960> then<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.410> use<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.619> silent

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
really slow and then you use a silent

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800 
really slow and then you use a silent
weapon<00:01:33.399> like<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.580> bow<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:33.880> arrow<00:01:34.210> or<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.630> knife

weapon like a bow and arrow or the knife

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.320 
weapon like a bow and arrow or the knife
there<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.470> go<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.100> AI<00:01:36.250> are<00:01:36.880> reacting

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
there you go that the AI are reacting

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.930 
there you go that the AI are reacting
appropriately<00:01:37.390> they<00:01:37.810> didn't<00:01:38.259> hear<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.530> kill

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
appropriately they didn't hear that kill

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.340 
appropriately they didn't hear that kill
putting<00:01:39.940> all<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.179> together<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.929> really

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
putting all that together a really

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.120 
putting all that together a really
