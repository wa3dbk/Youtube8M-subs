00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.150
 Hello dear friends with you line 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:13.219
 this cybersportsman weekdays I will tell you 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.450
 so far about why I decided to share 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 weekdays fu extras in broad daylight on 2 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 rubrics would it happen one by one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.520
 the reason that my videos didn't look like that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.540
 were not particularly logical whether something is included 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.230
 in one video and tournament and random like that 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.449
 something is not good in general, I divided the second 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 rubus fuscus todes on the head for 2 on 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.079
 cyber sportsman 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 and tastes extras in the first version 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.800
 will be shown 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 rinks from various tournaments of various 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.980
 formats in the second version will be 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 skating rinks from random show 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.710
 Now we will begin to fight with the team 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 course in the sixth round of debts 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.519
 Syria is kind of like you saw nothing 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.749
 interesting did not happen because until 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.639
 her company began to anal maiden for all 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.799
 the minute is obviously not that time which 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:06.840
 which is enough to somehow 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.030
 move your opponent around the map 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 tank and then they are therefore all over 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.579
 naturally nothing to him had nothing 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.610
 do with it by giving on ruinberg everything was 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.670
 much more actively interesting because 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.909
 what 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.479
 course immediately went to Zelenka 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.770
 and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.790
 with the f line pushed on borrow devyastik 11 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.790
 we seized the information right away we could 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.280
 take your counteractions to their tactics 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.030
 adobe Ð•dge decided to push and tanks 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.640
 which were top due to the fact that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 we got a numerical advantage we 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.930
 Could long ago you easily top tanker 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.899
 push as it seems to me the same way 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.539
 turned out very efficiently and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.350
 effectively distribute your drum in 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.580
 aft heavy tank top and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.110
 in practice it was izi skating rink for us 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.920
 further followed NSC which was 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.280
 many interesting things we immediately got 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.690
 information about the third party opponents 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.519
 who occupied the move we did not understand 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.049
 where are weave so taken 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.709
 there is no solution to separate your tanks 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.239
 left 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.760
 all on the greens at this moment as 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.510
 We arrived there the enemy weave 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.750
 not illuminated 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.670
 drove through the city eat us purse 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.320
 and not and at this moment we actually 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.739
 accepted and here it is fatal they are correct 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.930
 decision from about loving they wanted to take and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.660
 kill and now this day that push us 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.630
 or from the city absolutely for that to us 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.310
 had 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.790
 back from the greens move through 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.340
 the entrance is absolutely we yet this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.590
 did the show wonderful times come 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.350
 distribute clear we were getting from everyone 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
 enemy tanks were open 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.490
 the terrain was not possible not 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.210
 set with one to taste and as a result 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.640
 which we were able to really get all 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.430
 the forces could not do anything with us 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.650
 Only jury two were placed and the street 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.600
 left-handed inspira who would have to 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.060
 do you for all somehow 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.880
 ideally, the enemy allowed 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.340
 a lot of mistakes and only then would 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.300
 options for winning this fight 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.050
 Well, not the fate of youth carries 11 4 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.990
 map of the cliff on which again 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.110
 the enemy again made it clear that he 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.150
 does that is they played 1 2 3 line 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.980
 occupied and we completely stood 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.570
 perimeter and essentially all actions can 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.220
 almost agree information that 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.250
 where exactly does the enemy 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.470
 we have a room there and so on realizing that to 1 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.930
 there is one devyostyak whom no one 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.940
 covers we drove it was forwarded and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.680
 became such tanks to capture and 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.080
 it all happened on the last 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.130
 seconds so for the viewer I think this 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.970
 was given a gti demanding last card 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.310
 himmelsdorf 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.700
 again , our opponent shows us that they are 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.190
 make leaving their heavy tanks 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.720
 Sazhida and completely give it to us in 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.390
 as a result I decided to go 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:17.519
 pizza and it seems to me for free this 1 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.590
 but I was caught by surprise weaving which 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.000
 did not shine which stood on rats and 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.850
 positions in 1 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.200
 and she gave me two free shots 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.530
 I can not eat anything in return 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.230
 flew this advantage she 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.360
 it has become so serious but our mistake 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.940
 beat she did not have broadcast stood out 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.630
 further something to shoot me 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.200
 on the basis of 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.169
 my teammates rebuilt and were able to 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.830
 pick open bye and 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:50.130
 x-rays are also correct with this other 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.720
 opponent's tanks have lost a lot hp in 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.669
 positioning is behind ours and the third and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.760
 It turned out this from us five children izi 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.720
 reel in minus pound them immediately minus 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.030
 many hp and 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.520
 it was a matter of technique to go and take it 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.070
 all remaining opponents we did not 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.270
 kill 1 began to capture in a quick way 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.960
 win this match 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.460
 to score trainings further you can 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.190

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.020
