00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
you think is obvious but sometimes when

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.500 
you think is obvious but sometimes when

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
you're you're at elite level the obvious

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.110 
you're you're at elite level the obvious
gets<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:04.769> like<00:04:05.370> David<00:04:05.670> said<00:04:05.790> sometimes<00:04:06.090> you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
gets like like David said sometimes you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.330 
gets like like David said sometimes you
forget<00:04:06.269> what<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.870> don't<00:04:07.049> what<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.350> knew<00:04:07.500> so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.030 
forget what you don't what you knew so
making<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.480> connection<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.380> then<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.859> can

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
making that connection and then you can

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.680 
making that connection and then you can
really<00:04:11.459> drive<00:04:11.670> with<00:04:11.819> your<00:04:11.880> hips<00:04:12.030> made<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> huge

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
you need to make that connection first

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.969 
you need to make that connection first

the muscle inserts up here when it

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.530 
the muscle inserts up here when it

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
shoulder back into the socket that is

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.160 
shoulder back into the socket that is
hugely<00:04:43.610> protective<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:45.120> shoulder<00:04:45.450> I'm

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
not going to go into shoulder anatomy

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.610 
not going to go into shoulder anatomy
because<00:04:47.640> that's<00:04:47.880> even<00:04:48.120> more<00:04:48.150> complicated<00:04:49.110> but

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
because that's even more complicated but

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.230 
because that's even more complicated but
the<00:04:49.740> bottom<00:04:50.100> line<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.310> when<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.790> shoulder

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the bottom line is when the shoulder

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.710 
the bottom line is when the shoulder
floats<00:04:51.570> up<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:53.100> biceps<00:04:53.640> gets<00:04:54.300> smashed

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
between at the roof of the shoulder so

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.850 
between at the roof of the shoulder so
