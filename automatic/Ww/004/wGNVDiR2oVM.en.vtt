that you're going to hit with your stick
the<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.410> area<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> edge<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> stick

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the first area is the edge of the stick

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
the first area is the edge of the stick
which<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.849> more<00:00:30.060> thick<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.570> abrasive<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
which is more thick and abrasive the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
which is more thick and abrasive the
second<00:00:31.980> area<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.270> middle<00:00:33.600> area<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
second area is the more middle area of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
second area is the more middle area of
the<00:00:34.050> hi-hat<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.980> bulkiest<00:00:35.340> area<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the hi-hat the bulkiest area of your

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
the hi-hat the bulkiest area of your
hi-hat<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.079> hit<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> tip

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
hi-hat and you can hit that with the tip

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.880 
hi-hat and you can hit that with the tip
of<00:00:37.770> your<00:00:37.829> stick<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.620> clean

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
of your stick to get a really clean

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
of your stick to get a really clean
sound<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.760> today<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> talk

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
sound but today we're going to talk

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.549 
sound but today we're going to talk
about<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> different<00:00:43.050> sound<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.440> get

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
about the different sound you can get

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
about the different sound you can get
from<00:00:43.800> combining<00:00:44.370> open<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> closed<00:00:45.329> hi-hat

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
from combining open and closed hi-hat

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.200 
from combining open and closed hi-hat
sounds<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.100> guess<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> best<00:00:47.789> way<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> start

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
sounds so I guess the best way to start

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
sounds so I guess the best way to start
practicing<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.860> hit<00:00:50.340> your

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
practicing for this is to hit your

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
practicing for this is to hit your
hi-hat<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> open<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> then<00:00:51.860> closes

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
hi-hat with it open and then closes

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.020 
hi-hat with it open and then closes
hyatt<00:00:53.160> quickly<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.610> hid<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:53.910> it's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
hyatt quickly and hid it well it's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.130 
hyatt quickly and hid it well it's
closed<00:00:54.270> i'm<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
closed i'm going to show you how to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.779

do is start matching your hi-hat hits
with<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.070> base<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.530> once

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
with your base just like this once

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
with your base just like this once
you've<00:01:19.680> done<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> have

hi-hat back and forth like you did the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
hi-hat back and forth like you did the
first<00:01:26.580> time<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:27.270> practicing<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
going on and you understand how to do

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
going on and you understand how to do
that<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.479> start<00:01:36.840> messing<00:01:37.200> around<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that now start messing around with it in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.690 
that now start messing around with it in
your<00:01:37.829> drum<00:01:38.040> beats<00:01:38.220> i'm<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> show<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your drum beats i'm going to show you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
your drum beats i'm going to show you
different<00:01:39.030> ways<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.110> apply<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
different ways that you can apply this

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.190 
different ways that you can apply this
and<00:01:41.700> make<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.939> differs<00:01:42.720> hound<00:01:42.869> different

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and make it differs hound different

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
and make it differs hound different
every<00:01:43.380> single<00:01:43.409> time<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.490> first<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:44.820> going

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
every single time the first we're going

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
every single time the first we're going
to<00:01:44.970> talk<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> fitting<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.320> drum

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to talk about is fitting it into a drum

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
to talk about is fitting it into a drum
an<00:01:47.100> actual<00:01:47.460> drum<00:01:47.670> beat<00:01:47.820> us<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.540> normal<00:01:48.930> for

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
an actual drum beat us is normal for

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
an actual drum beat us is normal for
four<00:01:49.350> beat<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:49.890> first<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.340> ever

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
four beat the very first one you ever

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
four beat the very first one you ever
learn<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> throw<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> very

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
learn just going to throw it at the very

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.440 
learn just going to throw it at the very
end<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> measure

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.060 

there<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.960> it<00:02:03.740> okay<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.890> you'll

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
there you go that's it okay if you'll

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.350 
there you go that's it okay if you'll
notice<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> only<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.030> thing<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.270> I'm

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
notice the only different thing that I'm

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.390 
notice the only different thing that I'm
doing<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.810> I'm<00:02:07.140> striking<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> hi-hat<00:02:08.070> as<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
doing is I'm striking the hi-hat as it

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.110 
doing is I'm striking the hi-hat as it
opens<00:02:08.730> and<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.900> closes<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.970> like

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
opens and again as it closes just like

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.540 
opens and again as it closes just like
that<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.900> there's<00:02:13.380> your<00:02:13.470> first<00:02:13.800> drumbeat

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that so there's your first drumbeat

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.370 
that so there's your first drumbeat
application<00:02:15.330> with<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> open<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.260> closed

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
application with a open and closed

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.830 
application with a open and closed
hi-hat<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.640> start<00:02:18.030> opening<00:02:18.570> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
hi-hat now you can start opening and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.300 
hi-hat now you can start opening and
closing<00:02:18.990> high<00:02:19.320> hat<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.770> times<00:02:20.040> within

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
closing high hat and more times within

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.440 
closing high hat and more times within
the<00:02:20.430> measure<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:20.790> you've<00:02:21.030> got<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.270> feel<00:02:21.420> for

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the measure now you've got to feel for

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.000 
the measure now you've got to feel for
what<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.810> feels<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.740> I'm<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:22.920> going

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
what that feels like now I'm just going

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.560 
what that feels like now I'm just going
to<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> same<00:02:23.550> thing<00:02:23.790> back<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.360 

remember<00:02:30.570> i'm<00:02:30.900> opening<00:02:31.680> hi<00:02:31.890> hat<00:02:32.100> when<00:02:32.340> I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
remember i'm opening hi hat when I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
remember i'm opening hi hat when I
strike<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.000> closing<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> same<00:02:34.050> time

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
strike and closing it at the same time

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.160 
strike and closing it at the same time
as<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.560> strike<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.880> next<00:02:36.150> time<00:02:36.300> around<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
as I strike the next time around that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.080 
as I strike the next time around that
way<00:02:37.380> you're<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:37.920> hitting<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> high<00:02:38.640> hat<00:02:38.820> over

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
way you're not hitting the high hat over

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.820 
way you're not hitting the high hat over
and<00:02:39.210> over<00:02:39.300> again<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.660> when<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> first<00:02:40.350> started

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and over again I when I first started

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.400 
and over again I when I first started
learning<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.220> technique<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:42.410> would

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
learning this technique actually I would

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.990 
learning this technique actually I would
open<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.860> high<00:02:43.980> hat<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.850> would

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
open the high hat like this and I would

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.460 
open the high hat like this and I would
strike<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.270> several<00:02:45.630> times<00:02:45.780> before<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.230> closed

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
strike it several times before I closed

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
strike it several times before I closed
it<00:02:46.790> sounds<00:02:47.790> really<00:02:47.910> bad<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.300> not<00:02:48.420> like

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it sounds really bad it's not like

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.320 
it sounds really bad it's not like
you're<00:02:48.660> slopping<00:02:48.960> around<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.470> messy<00:02:50.090> crap<00:02:51.090> load

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you're slopping around a messy crap load

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
you're slopping around a messy crap load
to<00:02:51.570> keep<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.050> clean<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.740> trick<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
to keep it really clean the trick to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.580 
to keep it really clean the trick to
this<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.790> striking<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> hi-hat<00:02:54.870> as<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.260> opens

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
this is striking the hi-hat as it opens

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
this is striking the hi-hat as it opens
as<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.100> closes<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> measure<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.450> once

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
as it closes on the measure so once

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.210 
as it closes on the measure so once
you've<00:02:57.840> done<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.890> feel<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
you've done that now you have a feel of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.040 
you've done that now you have a feel of
what<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.670> feels<00:02:59.850> like<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> open<00:03:00.480> hi-hat<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
what it feels like to open hi-hat and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.080 
what it feels like to open hi-hat and
close<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.830> hi-hat<00:03:02.190> back-to-back<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.030> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
close the hi-hat back-to-back and you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.140 
close the hi-hat back-to-back and you
remember<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:04.410> know<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> strike<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
remember you know to strike it at the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.580 
remember you know to strike it at the
same<00:03:06.300> time<00:03:06.480> as<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> opens<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.110> closes<00:03:07.260> now

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
same time as it opens and closes now

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.229 
same time as it opens and closes now
what<00:03:07.800> you're<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.400> string<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
what you're going to do is string the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.150 
what you're going to do is string the
same<00:03:09.480> process<00:03:09.959> over<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.770> over<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.040> over

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
same process over and over and over

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160 
same process over and over and over
again<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.390> constant<00:03:12.870> open

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
again so that you have a constant open

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.840 
again so that you have a constant open
and<00:03:13.290> closing<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> hi-hat<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.610> going<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
and closing of the hi-hat it's going to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.850 
and closing of the hi-hat it's going to
sound<00:03:15.000> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.480> circusy<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.590> it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
sound kind of circusy like but it's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.070 
sound kind of circusy like but it's

for instance corn does a lot of this
where<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.600> open<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> close<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.140> hi-hat

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
where you open to close the hi-hat

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.690 
where you open to close the hi-hat
continuously<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.489> show<00:03:23.580> you

only places that you can fit the hi-hat
opening<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.190> closing<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> few

opening and closing this is just a few

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.360 
opening and closing this is just a few
areas<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:40.350> kind<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.650> give<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:40.950> an<00:03:40.980> idea<00:03:41.130> of

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
incorporated into drum beats we're going

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.440 
incorporated into drum beats we're going
to<00:04:14.680> work<00:04:14.830> on<00:04:14.950> another<00:04:15.190> method<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.880> hitting<00:04:16.360> the

like this all you're going to have to do
is<00:04:25.810> just<00:04:26.190> try<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.310> practice<00:04:27.490> with<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.850> be<00:04:28.090> sure

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
sound alright you can fit that into drum

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.020 
sound alright you can fit that into drum
beats<00:04:36.730> in<00:04:37.740> coordination<00:04:38.740> with<00:04:38.890> your<00:04:39.040> base<00:04:39.400> to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
beats in coordination with your base to
