that you can take those people to and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.200 
that you can take those people to and
get<00:02:43.140> how<00:02:43.590> would<00:02:43.770> they<00:02:43.920> particularly<00:02:44.550> respond

get how would they particularly respond
to<00:02:45.420> being<00:02:45.630> out<00:02:45.780> at<00:02:45.930> sea<00:02:45.960> or<00:02:46.770> out<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.160> big

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
to being out at sea or out on this big

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.890

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
gonna work in almost any situation as

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.070 
gonna work in almost any situation as

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.959 
what's been going on today we've got the
adult<00:06:07.259> more<00:06:07.529> excited<00:06:08.009> than<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.189> kids<00:06:08.279> always

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
adult more excited than the kids always

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.860 
adult more excited than the kids always
the<00:06:09.150> way<00:06:09.300> though<00:06:11.180> we've<00:06:12.180> just<00:06:12.389> come<00:06:12.569> back<00:06:12.599> from

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
the way though we've just come back from

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:20.959 
the way though we've just come back from
Florida<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.620> that<00:06:13.740> was<00:06:13.919> that<00:06:18.979> first<00:06:19.979> day<00:06:20.310> yes

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
Florida and that was that first day yes

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.360 
Florida and that was that first day yes
so<00:06:21.330> I<00:06:21.599> think<00:06:21.900> that's<00:06:22.319> always<00:06:22.529> especially<00:06:23.129> in

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
so I think that's always especially in

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.399 
so I think that's always especially in
my<00:06:23.520> house<00:06:23.789> so<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.330> older<00:06:24.629> ones<00:06:24.810> are<00:06:24.960> much<00:06:25.169> more

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
my house so the older ones are much more

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.559 
my house so the older ones are much more
excited<00:06:25.979> than<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.249> younger<00:06:26.610> ones<00:06:26.819> bizarre

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
excited than the younger ones bizarre
