the turnbuckle is going to go into the
spot<00:02:44.239> right<00:02:44.959> there<00:02:45.410> where<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.709> took<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.040> pin

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
spot right there where we took the pin

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.110 
spot right there where we took the pin
out<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.870> place<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.440> pin<00:02:48.819> back<00:02:49.819> through

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
out and then place the pin back through

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.370 
out and then place the pin back through
the<00:02:50.209> hole<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:51.080> hook<00:02:51.440> back<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.370> pin<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the hole then hook back in the pin and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.430 
the hole then hook back in the pin and
always<00:02:54.380> stick<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.769> pin<00:02:54.950> all<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.489> way<00:02:55.519> through

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
always stick the pin all the way through

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.120 
always stick the pin all the way through
if<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:59.350> that<00:03:00.350> way<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.590> know<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.860> don't

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
if you can that way you know you don't

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.300 
if you can that way you know you don't
lose<00:03:01.400> them<00:03:02.440> all<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:03.950> three

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
lose them all right we have three

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.699 
lose them all right we have three
positions<00:03:04.519> one<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.480> that's<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.560> most

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
positions one and that's the most

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.319 
positions one and that's the most
aggressive<00:03:07.250> position<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.850> makes<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.180> rake

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
aggressive position it makes the rake

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.060 
aggressive position it makes the rake
more<00:03:08.630> vertical<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.769> then<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.680> second

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
more vertical and then to the second

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.610 
more vertical and then to the second
position<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.930> little<00:03:15.260> less<00:03:15.440> aggressive

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
position is a little less aggressive

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.060 
position is a little less aggressive
this<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.400> most<00:03:16.549> common<00:03:17.000> position<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:18.070> we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
this is the most common position that we

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.330 
this is the most common position that we
use<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.670> then<00:03:20.299> number<00:03:20.510> three<00:03:21.130> number<00:03:22.130> three

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
use and then number three number three

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.110 
use and then number three number three
position<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> little<00:03:24.130> less<00:03:25.130> vertical<00:03:25.790> and

besides the adjustment that we have the

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.340 
besides the adjustment that we have the
three<00:03:31.670> position<00:03:32.120> adjustment<00:03:32.540> we<00:03:32.840> also<00:03:33.019> have

three position adjustment we also have
two<00:03:33.590> sides<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.070> our<00:03:34.280> grading<00:03:34.519> bar<00:03:34.820> one<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.780> can

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
two sides to our grading bar one you can

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.319 
two sides to our grading bar one you can
see<00:03:36.140> what<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.680> grading<00:03:37.040> serrated<00:03:37.820> edge<00:03:38.120> is

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
see what the grading serrated edge is

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.020 
see what the grading serrated edge is
down<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.989> then<00:03:39.530> we<00:03:39.620> can<00:03:39.799> turn<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.160> over<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:43.030> if

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
down and then we can turn it over and if

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.300 
down and then we can turn it over and if
you<00:03:44.180> also<00:03:44.600> use<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.079> flat<00:03:45.350> edge<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.010> if<00:03:46.190> you

for<00:04:02.049> traveling<00:04:03.049> we<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> bail<00:04:04.100> pin<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.730> you

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
for traveling we have a bail pin and you

for traveling we have a bail pin and you
put<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.600> in<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.290> unit<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.100> castor<00:04:07.880> and

put that in the unit in the castor and

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.750 
put that in the unit in the castor and
then<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.050> allows<00:04:09.379> you<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.830> travel<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.580> that

then that allows you to travel so that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.150 
then that allows you to travel so that
it<00:04:10.940> locks<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.409> locks<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.099> place

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
it locks it locks it in place

when you're ready to use the machine

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.060 
when you're ready to use the machine

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
then you can take the Bale pin out and

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.470 
then you can take the Bale pin out and
then<00:04:22.070> put<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.490> casters<00:04:22.910> down<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:24.340> then<00:04:25.480> you

then put the casters down and then you

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.470 
then put the casters down and then you
can<00:04:26.630> either<00:04:26.780> lock<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.290> into<00:04:27.440> position<00:04:27.770> and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
can either lock it into position and

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.640 
can either lock it into position and
that<00:04:29.480> would<00:04:29.690> be<00:04:29.840> if<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.139> weren't<00:04:30.380> going<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.530> be

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
that would be if you weren't going to be

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.080 
that would be if you weren't going to be
using<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.100> rope<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.550> you're<00:04:31.669> just<00:04:31.820> going<00:04:32.000> to

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
using the rope and you're just going to

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.010 
using the rope and you're just going to
drag<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.710> use<00:04:34.220> position<00:04:34.820> we<00:04:35.540> take<00:04:35.780> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
drag in the use position we take the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.730 
drag in the use position we take the
Bale<00:04:36.260> pin<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:36.830> put<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.100> in<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.370> front<00:04:37.610> hole

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.730 

and<00:04:45.740> then<00:04:45.919> lock<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.190> over<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:48.410> they<00:04:48.560> don't

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
and then lock it over and so they don't

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.070 
and then lock it over and so they don't
fall<00:04:49.340> over<00:04:49.669> in<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.000> front<00:04:50.270> position<00:04:50.450> when

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
fall over in the front position when

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.840 
fall over in the front position when
you're<00:04:51.260> using<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.770> they'll<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.490> go

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
you're using it they'll just go

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.420 
you're using it they'll just go
partially<00:04:53.540> up<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.830> keeps<00:04:55.070> them<00:04:55.250> from

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
heavy enough to do my gravel driveway

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.800 
heavy enough to do my gravel driveway
that's<00:05:03.970> 10-12<00:05:04.970> years<00:05:05.120> old

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
that's 10-12 years old

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.320 
that's 10-12 years old
well<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.010> handles<00:05:07.400> are<00:05:07.520> specifically<00:05:08.000> made

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
well the handles are specifically made

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.860 
well the handles are specifically made
with<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:09.640> racking<00:05:10.640> system<00:05:11.060> for<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.390> cinder<00:05:11.840> block

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
with a racking system for a cinder block

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.560 
with a racking system for a cinder block
we<00:05:12.410> recommend<00:05:12.919> two<00:05:13.160> cinder<00:05:13.580> blocks<00:05:13.820> one<00:05:14.210> with

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
we recommend two cinder blocks one with

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.040 
we recommend two cinder blocks one with
that's<00:05:15.380> empty<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.240> one<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:19.600> concrete<00:05:20.600> added

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
that's empty and one with concrete added

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.580 
that's empty and one with concrete added
to<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.350> middle<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.800> we<00:05:21.890> put<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.130> rebar<00:05:23.590> piece

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
to the middle and we put a rebar piece

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.110 
to the middle and we put a rebar piece
in<00:05:24.800> there<00:05:24.950> when<00:05:25.100> we're<00:05:25.250> putting<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.640> concrete

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
in there when we're putting the concrete

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.840 
in there when we're putting the concrete
in<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.100> a<00:05:28.130> handle<00:05:28.640> because

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
in so that you have a handle because

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.400 
in so that you have a handle because
it's<00:05:29.000> hard<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.210> pick<00:05:29.419> up<00:05:29.570> without<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.020> handle

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
it's hard to pick up without the handle

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.580 
it's hard to pick up without the handle
well<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.460> weighs<00:05:31.789> 75<00:05:32.210> pounds<00:05:32.750> by<00:05:32.900> itself<00:05:33.289> and

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
well it weighs 75 pounds by itself and

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.440 
well it weighs 75 pounds by itself and
with<00:05:33.830> this<00:05:33.979> cinder<00:05:34.460> block<00:05:34.669> full<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:35.210> concrete

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
with this cinder block full of concrete

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.930 
with this cinder block full of concrete
it<00:05:35.900> adds<00:05:36.080> an<00:05:36.260> additional<00:05:36.770> 75<00:05:37.340> pounds<00:05:37.700> for<00:05:37.910> a

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
it adds an additional 75 pounds for a

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.820 
it adds an additional 75 pounds for a
overall<00:05:38.600> weight<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:39.169> hundred<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.590> fifty

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
overall weight of a hundred and fifty

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.760 
overall weight of a hundred and fifty
pounds<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.180> plenty<00:05:41.720> heavy<00:05:42.020> enough<00:05:42.350> for

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
pounds this is plenty heavy enough for

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.300 
pounds this is plenty heavy enough for
the<00:05:42.890> toughest<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.520> gravel<00:05:43.880> driveways
