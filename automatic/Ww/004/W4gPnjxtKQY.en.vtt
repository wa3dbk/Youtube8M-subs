00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 Yesterday I saw him 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.060
 Which hand is in your hands? 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.980
 Startled, I realized it wasn't you, 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.580
 Do not know where you are now? 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.060
 How long have not we met each other? 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.460
 How long does not ask a few questions? 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.500
 Any doubt he saw this today 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.100
 Did not know what to do here? 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 Not once did he run out of questions, why did you leave him? 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.020
 To continue the path of love beside him 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
 Not once did he stop thinking, what did he do wrong? 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 Or is there anything you have not equal to that person? 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.660
 Is that person good to you, love you like you used to love? 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.060
 Does that person know how to blame me or like to pamper me? 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.340
 I miss you so much ... I miss you so much ... 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.900
 Why do I have to wait for the night to wait? 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.140
 Does the person loudly or always make me sad? 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.540
 Does that person know that you love me so much? 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.820
 I miss you so much ... I miss you so much ... 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.480
 Let your heart lessen the sadness and pain in your heart. 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.180
 Is that person good to you, love you like you used to love? Let your heart lessen the sadness and pain in your heart. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.780
 I miss you so much ... I miss you so much ... 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.020
 Why do I have to wait for the night to wait? 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.780

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 Why do I have to wait for the night to wait? 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.620
