00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello today I tell you something about 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 my ears stretched meanwhile 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.179
 again grown because because 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.849
 many have asked how it is 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.100
 has come and so on 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.350
 I wanted to wait a bit now 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 because I now only times in peace 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 wanted to leave and wanted to look like her 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 They change if they are at all 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.880
 change or not and it is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.540
 somehow still so unfamiliar the chamber 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.559
 In any case, it's about yes now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 almost so as two or three months even 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 that I took her out and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 now for the first time how it happened 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 I thought at some point that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 I do not think they are beautiful or rather 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.149
 that I kind of like what 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.039
 Something else did not matter anyway 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.579
 why I just got her out then 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.079
 took 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.180
 I was not sure if she was easy 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.640
 so I can take out first 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 think about it maybe first 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 smaller sizes should reinsetzen at the end 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 i was i believe in god i have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 even we forgot greetings here i had 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.340
 I think I even had it in the end 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:31.049
 but I had eight or ten millimeters 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 i even feel sorry for ccd 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.450
 I would have eight millimeters completely different 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 and yes, I have you there than I have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 I think about smaller sizes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.259
 the oil should still settle in it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.420
 so to speak, step by step 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.729
 can contract and then I have 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 also in some forums a bit 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 researched and was in the forums 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:04.729
 They say that is partially considered 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.729
 if you stretch it again so that almost 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 hurt earlobes rather 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 contracts because it is torn up 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.450
 in a way so far approximately 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.900
 what I mean if you do it again 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 then it almost lives and then has 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.620
 it still wants more 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.230
 close as if it somehow 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.879
 healed I did not do that 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.120
 I just have my tunnels out 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:39.160
 taken and is so by itself too 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.420
 grow that and actually after me 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.329
 that was taken out of the tunnel 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.110
 ear within a short time 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:56.290
 gone together very quickly and after 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.140
 I was able to catch mine for five hours 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.870
 do not use the millimeter tunnel anymore 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.280
 there went then maybe six or 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.069
 even less and after about 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:16.630
 two weeks or three had that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.430
 earlobe then so thanks i could 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.940
 then no longer the smallest tunnel 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.790
 Actually, they are both only used 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.049
 have holes or the two yes the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.040
 have different 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.810
 regressed 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.019
 one is bigger than the other 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.790
 and obviously I'm taking time as me 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.010
 I'll show you more, I'll show you 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.680
 you what I mean 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.680
 you see such a small I stroke 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.069
 unfortunately no ruler at home why 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.200
 always 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.019
 and I suspect that maybe 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.310
 could somehow be eight millimeters 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:57.340
 it was 1 8 mm strokes you recognize 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.709
 I like it shows you the same time it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.690
 is on both ears and I do not know 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.549
 if that would even look at you so 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.090
 So maybe I stretched wrong 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.879
 it is not a cat 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.040
 butt with me to happiness has arisen 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.599
 Just this one I stroke 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.239
 partly a bit annoying though 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.739
 If I wear normal earrings then 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.440
 I do not see that either 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.040
 meanwhile again with neither 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.760
 Pearl earrings of this beautiful and yes 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.750
 So I'll keep you right now then 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.669
 all one and try to show so 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.410
 how small the clock is and I have 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.660
 actually on this ear two 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.630
 earholes because you can see quite well 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:47.780
 the difference between quasi normal in the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:51.590
 still ear and stretched probably well that way 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:56.180
 this is the stretched holiday and directly 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.580
 next to here, mother and down there 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.639
 this is a normal holidays have 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.100
 I now and then still earrings inside 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.010
 that is the difference yes and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.400
 in this borehole the formerly stretched 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.400
 only hole I had now as I said 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.169
 no 300 no more tunnels in there 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.070
 just normal earrings 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.810
 stud with what I why the evening 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:26.870
 0.8 millimeters or something not yes and 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.200
 this is that stroke that I meant yes 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.750
 So it is good right now 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.190
 Not 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.770
 and it looks much bigger too 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:46.099
 as it is ultimately, I think yes 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:47.450
 So you look right 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:52.820
 this clock is not 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:55.310
 So even if I'm going to pull out like that 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.220
 the normal holiday disappears here 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.660
 completely so this smaller one 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.330
 Holiday completely beside yes and at 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.960
 a size of eight millimeters 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:13.190
 on the other side is this line 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.000
 just like that stretched hole 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.180
 it is smaller but only minimal 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.780
 and still bigger than a normal one 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:28.270
 holiday yes that's how it looks now devices 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.650
 ears after that, at least with me 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.630
 Of course we can totally different you 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.270
 his 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.000
 Maybe you can do it quite normally 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.390
 but going to be honest I think the 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.850
 I'm not happy that my ears 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:50.530
 now look as they look white 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.480
 everything around so not so you hear 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:58.900
 Here are all stories with this 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:01.180
 cats pop and everything else there I would be 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.130
 glad that I only get the stroke 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.720
 By the way, not so nice 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.550
 but well it was basically a one 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.590
 maybe more aware before that 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.380
 it would not look like it did before 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.690
 I said so even then it is 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.510
 By the way, already for eight months 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.620
 or longer I know I can 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.800
 I expect so well 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.930
 yes, good as I hope the video has you 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.090
 a bit to be saved on respect 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.600
 your decision I will now 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.850
 take a look at this other video 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.540
 yes that was it from me to the next 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.320
 times 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.320
