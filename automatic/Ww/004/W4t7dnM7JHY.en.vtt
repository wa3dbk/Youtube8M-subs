for the power share and let's just wait

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740 
for the power share and let's just wait
what<00:03:57.190> power<00:03:57.580> sure<00:03:57.820> what<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.300> don't<00:03:58.540> even<00:03:58.570> know

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
what power sure what I don't even know

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.990 
what power sure what I don't even know
what<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:58.959> does<00:03:59.200> so<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> go<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.640> screech

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
what that does so I go for screech

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240 
what that does so I go for screech
unaware<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.019> what<00:04:02.170> power<00:04:02.440> share<00:04:02.650> does<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
unaware of what power share does so I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
unaware of what power share does so I
was<00:04:03.489> like<00:04:03.610> okay<00:04:03.850> I'm<00:04:03.910> just<00:04:04.060> gonna<00:04:04.150> like

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
was like okay I'm just gonna like

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.500 
was like okay I'm just gonna like
cripple<00:04:05.590> your<00:04:05.769> defense<00:04:06.190> bite<00:04:06.459> like<00:04:06.820> minus<00:04:07.269> 2

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
cripple your defense bite like minus 2

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.009 
cripple your defense bite like minus 2
so<00:04:08.550> his<00:04:09.550> defense<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.090> crap<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.630> just<00:04:10.810> go<00:04:10.900> for

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
so his defense is crap and I just go for

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.030 
so his defense is crap and I just go for
the<00:04:11.140> gear<00:04:11.410> saucer

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
the gear saucer

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680 
the gear saucer
it<00:04:12.280> usually<00:04:12.550> takes<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:13.090> out<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.450> the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
it usually takes it out and the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.120 
it usually takes it out and the
Crittenden<00:04:14.080> America's<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.500> first<00:04:14.769> one<00:04:14.950> did

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
Crittenden America's the first one did

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.800 
Crittenden America's the first one did
over<00:04:15.519> half<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.150> second<00:04:16.450> one<00:04:16.540> would<00:04:16.690> have

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
over half and the second one would have

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.159 
over half and the second one would have
easily<00:04:17.140> took<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.709> out<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.959> yeah<00:04:19.959> question

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
easily took it it out so yeah question

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.260 
easily took it it out so yeah question
of<00:04:20.440> date<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.799> here<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> height<00:04:21.880> ratio

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
of date is here so have a height ratio

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.570 
of date is here so have a height ratio
so<00:04:22.540> they<00:04:22.720> seem<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.990> be<00:04:23.080> getting<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.410> lot<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.280> he

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
so they seem to be getting a lot but he

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.150 
so they seem to be getting a lot but he
brings<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:24.880> his<00:04:24.970> Zapdos<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.680> doing<00:04:26.680> crap<00:04:26.950> to

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
brings in his Zapdos and doing crap to

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.880 
brings in his Zapdos and doing crap to
it<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.660> it's<00:04:28.660> not<00:04:28.840> very<00:04:28.960> effective<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.710> it's

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
it so it's not very effective so it's

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.140 
it so it's not very effective so it's
just<00:04:29.979> like<00:04:30.130> I'm<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.550> like<00:04:30.610> I'm<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:30.910> gonna

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
hit somebody keeps good like I thought

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.260 
hit somebody keeps good like I thought
he<00:04:34.930> would<00:04:35.260> go<00:04:35.979> for<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.310> heat<00:04:36.490> wave<00:04:36.520> as<00:04:36.880> much<00:04:37.060> as

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
he would go for the heat wave as much as

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.370 
he would go for the heat wave as much as
like<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:38.020> that

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
like all that

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.920 
like all that
noses<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.400> like<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:40.270> some<00:04:40.420> reason<00:04:40.780> I

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
noses have but like for some reason I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
guess he might be like choiced in some

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.880 
guess he might be like choiced in some
way<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.150> don't<00:04:44.110> know<00:04:44.380> why<00:04:44.500> you'd<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.680> choice
