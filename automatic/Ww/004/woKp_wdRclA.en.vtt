00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.890
 hi hi yet I still have one 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:24.250
 package left here means mail 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.460
 sweden came I ordered the battery was 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.529
 I recently have a flashlight for which I 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.320
 tried to stick the batteries on so me 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.220
 nothing happened so ordered 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.710
 Need even two batteries because 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.010
 it turned out the seller on aliexpress 2 was 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.860
 cheaper than one here and of course to him 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.970
 charge so that's our hero here 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.410
 The flashlight that I bought at Blink 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.500
 Protupil and of course did not read from 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 what battery does it work for me there 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.690
 wrote comments what can be done 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.640
 adapter to three mini-thumb and 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.280
 kids but i didn't bother under 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.090
 milky is easier to order normal 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 battery from which it works and everything 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.979
 why suffer with these mini fingers 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 so oops so 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.790
 There were such batteries on Boeing anti 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.729
 But I was talking there 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.340
 Of course, they were cheaper, but the sellers 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.000
 the store wanted to send them to 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.430
 the picture 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 some problems there I say 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.540
 guys truth almost sweden all no no 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.680
 held 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.670
 so I had to order another place 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.590
 so I do not know I hope the battery is charged 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:01.689
 immediately went in so well so blender from not 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 wants to wow spun it now 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:11.560
 try to turn on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:17.230
 so go ahead no it does n't work 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:24.669
 okay now try the second may not 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:29.019
 discharged and clean now i'm at all 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:31.769
 I will look that for whom Lena to 18 650 on 3 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.879
 603 600 will not be here like this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.999
 so light 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.290
 but I think at least some 2000 miles and 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.989
 without was 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:48.669
 so for this flashlight should 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:51.659
 enough so spun does not want to work 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.659
 what's up 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.000
 does not work probably need to be charged 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.319
 battery and because it does not want 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.470
 work let's see here the ball and charge 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.720
 you probably will not show 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 most likely I just give you 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.410
 accomplish your goal video and not laziness 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.180
 working like a flashlight here we are 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.380
 let's see charge-discharge what 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.080
 most primitive on one battery 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.019
 something about a half not 2 dollars i'm for 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.110
 she paid it you put water in here 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:43.110
 The battery here is inserted and the plug 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.980
 solely the seller did not put me 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.200
 adapter is a minus 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.370
 I asked but did not put here such 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.650
 here is a flat wreath 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.780
 so on principle nothing scary 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.690
 I have a couple of adapters at home therefore 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.950
 I will find out what to charge and current strength 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.769
 we are 600 milliamps ie put on 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.420
 you are here 3,600 until you understood how much 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.870
 he will charge quite a long time he 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.299
 will charge and that's not good 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.690
 Well, Iâ€™m another principle so cheap 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.350
 Charging did not expect here but there are way more 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:25.340
 here is the indicator 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.340
 oh by the way look at the glowing indicator 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:33.960
 Here such here and destitute and by the way now 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.950
 I'll drop in. Well, I put it in the wrong way. 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.110
 I do not know now, but come what is 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.190
 so now 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:52.830
 help them a little lantern because i 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:55.010
 I don't know. I don't think that Dad, and this is not for us. 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.010
 need to 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:04.150
 how do I need her customer back oh you 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.040
 caught fire 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.280
 I screwed up something here and I have it 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:18.550
 caught fire on the account like some 3 a 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:20.070
 that's all understood this is mode 1 here is such 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.280
 blinking 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.280
 just burning and the third mode 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.270
 current 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.930
 and some sort of but three modes not 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.680
 I know about feeling well 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.740
 pretty bright so here I am right now we have something 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.460
 he shines of course far from i switch he 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.850
 breaks to the window itself even though I am from it 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.370
 I am probably ten meters 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:59.450
 Of course the lantern will be normal 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.230
 use and I think the purchase is successful 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.780
 there will be links on it turns out on 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.630
 batteries and charging will be links 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.610
 on the seller and on the goods themselves and to whom 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.710
 interesting because the seller is engaged 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.320
 batteries so it is very 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.580
 huge choice of who should contact and 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.990
 There you think you will find what you all 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.590
 subscribe to the channel put the likes well 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.590
