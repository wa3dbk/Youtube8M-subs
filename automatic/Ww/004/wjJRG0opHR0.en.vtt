00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.580
 breathe 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 the air of my country a country where the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.619
 sky is still gray day to day 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.920

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.770
 and mistreated where all those who rule 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.229
 they are bribed damn dogs someday 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.690

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.330
 where the one who tells the truth is treated 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.670
 of terrorists do not confuse yourself to anything 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.280
 how they paint it to the tourist welcome 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.440

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.429

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.649
 story with the same rage the time 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.440

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.150
