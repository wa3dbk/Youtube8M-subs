 for a new tutorial to this guy there 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.560
 christopher bieber made music from 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.560
 music clips and none either 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150
 m 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.130
 the music video is an evening where 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.670
 bieber and his team arrive in black audi 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.530
 quiet 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.329
 alas from the beginning there is something that me 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 shocks a good one we did it all 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.649
 but then we have a combo of guys 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.390
 who have sunglasses then 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.530
 it's dark our night 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.789
 and sunglasses 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.969
 to us seriously it's true but 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.579
 just why my sunglasses 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.969
 I often have them on me almost all 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.439
 time I eat with I piss with that I 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.329
 do everything with my sunglasses 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.140
 the only times it happens to me 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.610
 to take off 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 it's to look at myself in the mirror because 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.409
 I am the luxury of swag we know that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.819
 detail but let's listen instead to the talent 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.819
 voice of this promising young artist 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.120
 I did not hold 15 seconds what's this 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.950
 brothel what's that then sir 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.950
 arrives in the evening attention big evening 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.380
 so that happens we tell you this is the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.790
 play bad boy american star but that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.780
 turns cola orange juice and to 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.340
 fantasies 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.959
 Well done, I'm not going there 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 even if the younger ones will not say so 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.510
 cute but listen to the lyrics but 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.510
 look 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.440
 no the girl looks super packed 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.380
 by his speech of lower but what 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.980
 stupid and look at it's good because 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.810
 that I am paid 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.450
 oh yes the music there were two more 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.459
 singers who put themselves in there first 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.849
 view it looks like jean ramel kind on 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.849
 twitter 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.860
 but actually no it's one of the only 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.860
 blacks that I saw with such a voice 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.950
 seriously the first reaction when 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.960
 I saw that happened before 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.240
 it's a little look like expression that 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.320
 date a little but his voice is wrong with 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.320
 his body a jungle 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.800
 there is a lot of stuff to say 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.240
 but hey, I'm not making you 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.560
 documentary either but you 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.630
 listen to the lyrics and that's 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.930
 frankly qqc it looks like it's 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.420
 written by a cameron parent where you tell me 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.440

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.440

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.129
 to his promise except that in the end he was 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.129
