00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480

all right let's start the next level
facility<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.799> ain't<00:00:04.799> trying<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> get<00:00:05.100> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
facility I ain't trying to get the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.160 
facility I ain't trying to get the
invincibility<00:00:05.670> cheap<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.330> if<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.810> was<00:00:06.990> it

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
invincibility cheap and if I was it

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.480 
invincibility cheap and if I was it
would<00:00:07.259> probably<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.680> taken<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:08.160> than<00:00:08.309> just

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
would probably have taken more than just

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.669 
would probably have taken more than just
one<00:00:08.670> take<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.240> yeah<00:00:09.870> skip<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> background

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
one take so yeah skip the background

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.970 
one take so yeah skip the background
with<00:00:10.889> more<00:00:12.679> done<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.660> done<00:00:15.660> done<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
with more done and done done are in the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010 
with more done and done done are in the
event<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.449> here

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
event going through here

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.269 
event going through here
all<00:00:19.380> right<00:00:19.500> normally<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.859> would<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.010> kill

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
all right normally I would just kill

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
all right normally I would just kill
that<00:00:20.460> guy<00:00:20.670> which<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.000> probably<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:22.050> have

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that guy which is probably would have

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
that guy which is probably would have
been<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> lot<00:00:22.410> smarter<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.240> all<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.359> that's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
been a lot smarter but all right that's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
been a lot smarter but all right that's
another<00:00:24.869> sign<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> epic<00:00:26.130> failure<00:00:26.640> missing<00:00:27.029> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
now I'm trying to take out as many guys

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
now I'm trying to take out as many guys
these<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.159> gonna<00:01:50.280> point<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.670> out

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
these can now I'm gonna point this out

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
these can now I'm gonna point this out
the<00:01:51.390> closer<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> guys<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the closer you are to the guys and the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.270 
the closer you are to the guys and the
more<00:01:53.220> likely<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.110> gun<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
more likely they it is that the gun that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.340 
more likely they it is that the gun that
the<00:01:56.520> tip<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> might<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.869> directly

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the tip of it might actually go directly

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.700 
the tip of it might actually go directly
through<00:01:58.770> bonds<00:01:59.219> body<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> even<00:02:01.439> in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
through bonds body so you know even in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.880 
through bonds body so you know even in
max<00:02:01.950> stats<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.149> actually<00:02:03.689> miss<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.829> now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
max stats it will actually miss so now

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.780 
max stats it will actually miss so now
I'm<00:02:04.950> checking<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.430> any<00:02:05.579> guys

again just check it all around main

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.500 
again just check it all around main
grout<00:02:21.569> triggers<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:23.519> opening<00:02:23.879> now

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
grout triggers and now I'm opening now

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.110 
grout triggers and now I'm opening now
I'm<00:02:24.659> busting<00:02:24.959> open<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.290> box<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:27.060> I'm

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
I'm busting open that box and now I'm

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
I'm busting open that box and now I'm
trying<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> ammo<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> find<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.349> pound

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
trying to get the ammo I find it pound

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.030 
trying to get the ammo I find it pound
it<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:32.329> now<00:02:33.329> my<00:02:34.019> initial<00:02:34.349> idea<00:02:34.440> here

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it all right so now my initial idea here

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670 
it all right so now my initial idea here
was<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.640> could<00:02:36.090> blow<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.840> boxes<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.379> right

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
was that I could blow the boxes up right

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.199 
was that I could blow the boxes up right
as<00:02:37.799> they<00:02:37.920> were<00:02:37.950> leaving<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> room<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.030> that

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
as they were leaving the room so that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.990 
as they were leaving the room so that
with<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.140> bullet<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.650> could<00:02:40.920> take<00:02:41.459> out<00:02:41.640> both

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
with one bullet I could take out both

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
with one bullet I could take out both
the<00:02:42.299> guys<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.410> boxes<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:45.000> I'm

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the guys and the boxes and this I'm

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
the guys and the boxes and this I'm
doing<00:02:45.450> again<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.049> retarded<00:02:46.410> procedure<00:02:46.739> I'm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
doing again that retarded procedure I'm

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.369 
doing again that retarded procedure I'm
going<00:02:47.069> through<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.780> support<00:02:49.140> where<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
going through and this support where it

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.130 
going through and this support where it
gets<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> biggest<00:02:50.180> explosion<00:02:51.180> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
gets like the biggest explosion that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.430 
gets like the biggest explosion that
I've<00:02:52.260> seen<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.769> game<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.840> yeah<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.200> also

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
I've seen in the game so yeah and also

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.670 
I've seen in the game so yeah and also
it<00:02:55.620> foods<00:02:56.010> later<00:02:56.220> very<00:02:56.970> soon<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.319> proves

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
it foods later very soon so that proves

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.300 
it foods later very soon so that proves
useful<00:02:58.920> later<00:02:59.250> I<00:03:00.890> didn't<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.099> they<00:03:02.280> could

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
useful later I didn't think they could

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.920 
useful later I didn't think they could
do<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.879> did<00:03:03.120> not<00:03:03.239> think<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:03.720> could<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
do that I did not think that it could do

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.149 
do that I did not think that it could do
that<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.200> now<00:03:04.319> I'm<00:03:04.379> going<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.890> shock

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
that and now I'm going kind of the shock

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.640 
that and now I'm going kind of the shock
of<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.180> was<00:03:06.299> like<00:03:06.390> alright<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.530> now

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
of that and I was like alright so now

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.199 
of that and I was like alright so now
I'll<00:03:07.769> try<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.950> use<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.700> he's<00:03:08.819> too<00:03:08.970> far

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
I'll try to use that but he's too far

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
doing perfect runs in fact I'm not doing

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.160 
doing perfect runs in fact I'm not doing
speedruns<00:03:55.360> either<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.659> probably<00:03:55.959> would<00:03:56.140> have

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
speedruns either I probably would have

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.350 
speedruns either I probably would have
already<00:03:56.470> epically<00:03:56.860> failed<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.299> now<00:03:58.299> I'm

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
already epically failed that now I'm

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.869 
already epically failed that now I'm
collecting<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.840> ammo<00:03:59.200> all<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.280> ammo<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
collecting the ammo all the ammo I

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.520 
collecting the ammo all the ammo I
thought<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.540> could<00:04:01.750> blow<00:04:01.959> them<00:04:02.140> up<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.409> those

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
thought it could blow them up with those

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.759 
thought it could blow them up with those
boxes<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:03.159> there<00:04:03.280> again<00:04:03.459> they<00:04:03.670> were<00:04:03.730> too<00:04:03.879> far

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
boxes but there again they were too far

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.680 
boxes but there again they were too far
activated<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:05.830> security<00:04:06.459> security<00:04:07.180> odd<00:04:07.450> or

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
activated that security security odd or

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.660 
activated that security security odd or
say<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:10.930> part<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.650> almost<00:04:12.159> always<00:04:12.370> kills

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
say this part so it almost always kills

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.039 
say this part so it almost always kills
me<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:12.940> max<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.390> sense<00:04:13.659> because<00:04:13.930> you

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
me in the max that sense because you

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.289 
me in the max that sense because you
have<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.470> let<00:04:14.650> them<00:04:14.799> see<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.159> just<00:04:16.000> shooting

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
have to let them see you just shooting

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.060 
have to let them see you just shooting
at<00:04:16.419> them<00:04:16.660> even<00:04:17.019> with<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.260> aka<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:17.919> gonna

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
at them even with the aka is not gonna

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.479 
at them even with the aka is not gonna
work<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.699> really<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.590> try<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:21.459> know

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
work you really have to try to you know

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.730 
work you really have to try to you know
get<00:04:21.820> rather<00:04:22.090> attention<00:04:22.660> because<00:04:22.930> they<00:04:23.470> won't

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
get rather attention because they won't

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.320 
get rather attention because they won't
respond<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.520> can't<00:04:24.820> shoot<00:04:24.970> them<00:04:25.120> in<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
respond and you can't shoot them in the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.320 
respond and you can't shoot them in the
head<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:25.720> it's<00:04:25.870> not<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.199> smart<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:26.680> try<00:04:26.889> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
head so it's not very smart to try to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.350 
head so it's not very smart to try to
actually<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.630> know<00:04:28.889> shoot<00:04:29.889> them<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:31.240> I'm

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
actually you know shoot them so I'm

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.850 
actually you know shoot them so I'm
trying<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.600> get<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.840> guy<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.229> what's<00:04:32.710> weird

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
trying to get this guy and what's weird

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.140 
trying to get this guy and what's weird
is<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.220> other<00:04:33.370> guy<00:04:33.610> who<00:04:33.669> will<00:04:33.850> actually

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
is that the other guy who will actually

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.240 
is that the other guy who will actually
go<00:04:34.240> all<00:04:34.449> the<00:04:34.600> way<00:04:34.630> around<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:35.229> long<00:04:35.500> way<00:04:35.710> around

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
go all the way around a long way around

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.689 
go all the way around a long way around
and<00:04:37.740> yeah<00:04:38.740> right<00:04:38.949> there<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.280> finished

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
and yeah right there I just finished

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.129 
and yeah right there I just finished
them<00:04:39.850> off<00:04:39.970> real<00:04:40.180> quick<00:04:40.389> like<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.780> now<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.900> heard

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
them off real quick like and now I heard

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.379 
them off real quick like and now I heard
the<00:04:41.350> door<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.680> open<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.310> I'm<00:04:42.940> assuming<00:04:43.180> that

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
the door is open so I'm assuming that

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.850 
the door is open so I'm assuming that
retarded<00:04:43.810> scientist<00:04:44.260> who<00:04:44.380> always<00:04:44.530> needs<00:04:44.710> to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
retarded scientist who always needs to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.650 
retarded scientist who always needs to
come<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.729> bathroom<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.300> coming

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
come to the the bathroom is coming

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.810 
come to the the bathroom is coming
either<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.080> or<00:04:47.139> more<00:04:47.500> enemies<00:04:47.760> so<00:04:48.760> I'm

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
either that or more enemies so I'm

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.170 
either that or more enemies so I'm
checking<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.389> it's<00:04:49.539> I<00:04:49.870> think<00:04:50.050> it's<00:04:50.260> both<00:04:51.180> it's

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
checking and it's I think it's both it's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.510 
checking and it's I think it's both it's
more<00:04:52.690> enemies<00:04:53.139> came<00:04:53.440> as<00:04:53.740> they<00:04:54.130> will<00:04:54.280> sometimes

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
more enemies came as they will sometimes

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.469 
more enemies came as they will sometimes
do<00:04:54.970> when<00:04:55.210> you're<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:55.750> know<00:04:55.780> overly<00:04:56.229> open<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
do when you're you know overly open and

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.070 
do when you're you know overly open and
show<00:04:58.479> yourself<00:04:58.870> too<00:04:59.020> readily<00:04:59.430> and<00:05:01.080> that

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
show yourself too readily and that

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.690 
show yourself too readily and that
that's<00:05:02.349> what<00:05:02.560> what<00:05:02.680> always<00:05:02.979> kills<00:05:03.340> me<00:05:03.520> in<00:05:03.610> the

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
that's what what always kills me in the

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.420 
that's what what always kills me in the
max<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.150> stunts<00:05:04.510> um<00:05:04.780> when<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.530> unexpectedly
