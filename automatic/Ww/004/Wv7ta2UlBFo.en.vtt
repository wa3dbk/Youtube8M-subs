00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
so let's go dig that goal jump there as

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
so let's go dig that goal jump there as
you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.549> see<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.940> game<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.329> get<00:03:00.690> pretty<00:03:00.959> slow

haunt<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:23.470> basically<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.710> is<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:25.010> core<00:04:25.310> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
haunt it basically this is the core the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.330 
haunt it basically this is the core the
game<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.420> are<00:04:26.450> trying<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.960> balance<00:04:27.340> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
game so you are trying to balance the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.600 
game so you are trying to balance the
energy<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.240> within<00:04:29.660> one<00:04:29.990> level

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
energy that you have within one level

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.450 
energy that you have within one level
currently<00:04:31.610> we<00:04:31.730> have<00:04:32.080> 224<00:04:33.080> energy<00:04:33.530> each<00:04:33.860> action

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
currently we have 224 energy each action

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.110 
currently we have 224 energy each action
we<00:04:34.640> do<00:04:34.850> depletes<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.900> energy<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:38.000> a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
we do depletes that energy so it's a

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.210 
we do depletes that energy so it's a
balance<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.810> energy<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.420> actions<00:04:41.420> so<00:04:42.220> decide

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
balance of energy and actions so decide

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.780 
balance of energy and actions so decide
your<00:04:43.400> actions<00:04:43.850> well<00:04:45.310> go<00:04:46.310> check<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.670> out
