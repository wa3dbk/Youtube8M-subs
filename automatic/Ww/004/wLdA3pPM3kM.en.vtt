in<00:00:01.070> this<00:00:02.070> lesson<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.639> talking<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.149> how

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
in this lesson we're talking about how

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.589 
in this lesson we're talking about how
plants<00:00:04.259> are<00:00:04.560> classified<00:00:08.480> plants<00:00:09.480> are

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
plants are classified plants are

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.030 
plants are classified plants are
classified<00:00:10.730> into<00:00:11.730> two<00:00:12.000> main<00:00:12.269> categories

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
classified into two main categories

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.300 
classified into two main categories
nonvascular<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.990> vascular<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:17.070> first

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
nonvascular and vascular the first

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.210 
nonvascular and vascular the first
category<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> look<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:19.220> non

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
category we're going to look at is non

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.120 
category we're going to look at is non
vascular<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.930> before<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.590> let's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
vascular but before we do that let's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.269 
vascular but before we do that let's
look<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:24.000> review<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.199> vascular<00:00:25.949> tissue

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
look at a review of what vascular tissue

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
look at a review of what vascular tissue
is<00:00:28.340> vascular<00:00:29.340> tissue<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.570> system<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
is vascular tissue is a system of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
is vascular tissue is a system of
tube-like<00:00:31.949> structures<00:00:32.579> inside<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> plant

has<00:01:33.360> turned<00:01:34.320> blue<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> result<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
has turned blue that is all a result of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.670 
has turned blue that is all a result of
vascular<00:01:37.259> tissue<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:39.030> plants<00:01:39.450> have

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
vascular tissue but not all plants have

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.219 
vascular tissue but not all plants have
vascular<00:01:40.680> tissue<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> let's<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:43.079> at

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
vascular tissue so let's take a look at

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.490 
vascular tissue so let's take a look at
some<00:01:43.530> examples<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.189> plants<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> are

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
some examples of plants that are

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
some examples of plants that are
nonvascular<00:01:46.500> plants<00:01:46.610> plants<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.909> not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
nonvascular plants plants that do not

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.770 
nonvascular plants plants that do not
have<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.420> vascular<00:01:48.930> tissue<00:01:49.250> if<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:51.299> look<00:01:51.540> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have that vascular tissue if you look in

the soil but they look like this they

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.650 
the soil but they look like this they
are<00:04:03.660> liver<00:04:04.109> works<00:04:04.970> there<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.000> also<00:04:06.299> these

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
are liver works there are also these

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.129 
are liver works there are also these
things<00:04:06.870> called<00:04:07.230> horn<00:04:07.919> works<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.870> these<00:04:09.870> are<00:04:10.109> a

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
things called horn works and these are a

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.289 
things called horn works and these are a
little<00:04:10.319> bit<00:04:10.530> different<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:11.130> do<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.090> have

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
little bit different they do not have

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.120 
little bit different they do not have
vascular<00:04:12.750> tissue<00:04:13.109> just<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> other<00:04:13.919> two

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
vascular tissue just like the other two

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.009 
vascular tissue just like the other two
examples<00:04:14.639> but<00:04:14.940> they're<00:04:15.480> different<00:04:15.780> because

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
examples but they're different because

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.560 
examples but they're different because
they<00:04:16.440> don't<00:04:16.799> grow<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.190> rocks<00:04:17.370> or<00:04:17.880> tree<00:04:18.150> trunks

they don't grow on rocks or tree trunks
they're<00:04:19.049> more<00:04:19.410> likely<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:20.010> be<00:04:20.130> found<00:04:20.340> mixed<00:04:20.729> in

would<00:06:06.720> we<00:06:06.840> find<00:06:06.870> liver<00:06:07.320> words<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:07.890> then

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
would we find liver words and then

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.000 
would we find liver words and then
finally<00:06:09.330> where<00:06:09.690> would<00:06:09.810> we<00:06:09.960> find<00:06:10.010> hornworts

short<00:06:47.999> I'm<00:06:48.419> gonna<00:06:48.599> help<00:06:48.779> you<00:06:48.899> out<00:06:48.929> on<00:06:49.139> this<00:06:49.259> one

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
short I'm gonna help you out on this one

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.939 
short I'm gonna help you out on this one
remember<00:06:50.069> we<00:06:50.369> said<00:06:50.639> that<00:06:50.989> in<00:06:51.989> the<00:06:52.229> text<00:06:52.800> it

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
remember we said that in the text it

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.570 
remember we said that in the text it
says<00:06:53.279> that<00:06:53.580> nonvascular<00:06:54.479> plants<00:06:55.009> do<00:06:56.009> not<00:06:56.039> have

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
says that nonvascular plants do not have

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.669 
says that nonvascular plants do not have
cell<00:06:57.119> walls<00:06:57.419> cell<00:06:58.199> walls<00:06:58.469> are<00:06:58.889> a<00:07:00.439> second<00:07:01.439> layer

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
cell walls cell walls are a second layer

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:04.820 
cell walls cell walls are a second layer
of<00:07:02.029> plant<00:07:03.029> cells<00:07:03.360> that<00:07:03.599> make<00:07:03.869> them<00:07:04.139> stronger

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
of plant cells that make them stronger

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.959 
of plant cells that make them stronger
so<00:07:05.399> most<00:07:06.209> nonvascular<00:07:07.139> plants<00:07:07.399> are<00:07:08.399> short

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
so most nonvascular plants are short

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.019 
so most nonvascular plants are short
because<00:07:09.360> they<00:07:09.629> don't<00:07:09.839> have<00:07:09.929> the<00:07:10.349> extra<00:07:11.159> cell

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:12.029 
because they don't have the extra cell

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.059 
because they don't have the extra cell
wall<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.659> makes<00:07:12.839> them<00:07:13.139> more<00:07:13.349> sturdy<00:07:13.709> so

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.069 
wall that makes them more sturdy so

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.739 
wall that makes them more sturdy so
they're<00:07:14.219> not<00:07:14.369> as<00:07:14.580> strong<00:07:14.699> they<00:07:15.119> can't<00:07:15.360> grow<00:07:15.599> as

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:15.749 
they're not as strong they can't grow as

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:19.429 
they're not as strong they can't grow as
tall<00:07:17.179> how<00:07:18.179> our<00:07:18.389> liver<00:07:18.659> works<00:07:18.929> and<00:07:19.169> a<00:07:19.199> horn

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:19.439 
tall how our liver works and a horn

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.109 
tall how our liver works and a horn
works<00:07:19.679> different<00:07:20.279> you<00:07:20.699> should<00:07:20.849> be<00:07:20.909> able<00:07:21.059> to

works different you should be able to

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:23.929 
works different you should be able to
use<00:07:21.209> the<00:07:21.389> chart<00:07:21.659> right<00:07:21.839> above<00:07:22.110> here<00:07:22.349> to<00:07:22.939> answer

use the chart right above here to answer

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:28.609 
use the chart right above here to answer
that<00:07:24.499> how<00:07:25.499> do<00:07:25.559> they<00:07:26.749> look<00:07:27.749> differently<00:07:28.199> and

00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:28.619 
that how do they look differently and

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:32.959 
that how do they look differently and
think<00:07:29.490> about<00:07:29.789> also<00:07:30.089> how<00:07:30.749> they<00:07:31.740> I'm<00:07:32.729> sorry

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:32.969 
think about also how they I'm sorry

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.839 
think about also how they I'm sorry
where<00:07:33.389> they<00:07:33.659> grow<00:07:34.039> that<00:07:35.039> is<00:07:35.219> also<00:07:35.579> different

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
where they grow that is also different

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.899 
where they grow that is also different
for<00:07:36.059> those<00:07:36.149> two<00:07:36.389> the<00:07:37.379> I<00:07:37.409> get<00:07:37.769> it<00:07:37.889> question<00:07:38.309> you
