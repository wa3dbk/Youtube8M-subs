00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
you want to build on that line until you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.229 
you want to build on that line until you
have<00:02:14.090> your<00:02:14.240> desired<00:02:14.300> thickness<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:19.239> personally

have your desired thickness I personally

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.120 
have your desired thickness I personally
like<00:02:20.420> wearing<00:02:20.780> thick<00:02:21.080> line<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.830> because

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
like wearing thick line is just because

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.540 
like wearing thick line is just because
I<00:02:22.220> have<00:02:22.400> big<00:02:22.730> hair<00:02:23.030> bit<00:02:23.690> eyeballs<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.010> large

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
I have big hair bit eyeballs and a large

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.910 
I have big hair bit eyeballs and a large
lid<00:02:26.120> space<00:02:26.390> which<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.900> personally<00:02:27.320> think<00:02:27.530> can

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
lid space which I personally think can

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.220 
lid space which I personally think can
handle<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.430> thick<00:02:28.700> line<00:02:28.910> or<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.480> guess<00:02:30.050> just

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
handle a thick line or I guess just

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.170 
handle a thick line or I guess just
depending<00:02:30.709> on<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.920> time<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> day<00:02:31.610> or<00:02:31.640> wherever
