00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.270
 [My favorite NUMBER] I do not know if "favorite" is the right word, but the number that has taken over my life is 40, four zero. 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm Kaushik Basu. I am the first economist 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 and first vice president of the World Bank. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 We are analyzing the income growth rate of the poorest 40% of the population. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.820
 And on one level, this is a philosophical idea 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 that comes from the philosopher John Rawls, who "judges a society for how the poorest and most disadvantaged people do". 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.490
 And it is the same concept that appears in the writings of Gandhi that proposes "thinking about the weakest and poorest person 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.920
 when one is caught in a dilemma and doing what is good for that person. " 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.490
 To transform these sublime and philosophical ideas into something concrete 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.730
 around which the World Bank can organize its activities, a specific figure is needed. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.790
 It is well known that it is very difficult to calculate the exact income of the poorest and richest people. 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.280
 The richest people do not know how much they earn and the poor get income from many sources. 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 For example, an occasional job, some food that someone gives them. It is very complicated to determine the income figure. 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.080
 Simply getting the data from people who are below that 40% is not an easy task. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.660
 And I have to say that since I work on this, the number 40 has taken over my life 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.520
 because I spend a lot of time on policies related to the poorest 40% of the population, 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 to the data collection, and yes, my life has revolved around this. 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.950
 I started to dedicate myself to economics when I was an undergraduate student, 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.110
 but it was due to a very strange agreement between my father and me. 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.850
 My dad wanted me to study mathematics and they were days of rebellion where I did not want to do anything, 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.110
 and we discussed, discussed, and agreed that economics was an intermediate solution. 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.690
 When I arrived at the London School of Economics to obtain another academic degree, a Master's degree in Economics, 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.780
 I really fell in love with the subject. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.710
 We are analyzing the income growth rate of the poorest 40%. 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.600
 This means that, first, the individuals that are in this segment of the population are located. 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.270
 Then, with time, the follow-up is done not only of said people but of anyone who falls by 40%. 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.660
 So the following year it may not be exactly the same set of people. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.680
 Some may have left 40%, new people may have fallen in said 40%. 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.890
 And this is an intelligent analysis because it forces us to pay attention 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.870
 even people who are above the 40% mark, because if they are completely ignored, 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.110
 these will be a focus of interest in the 40% segment in the next period. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.830
 For example, we see that during the last 10 years in the countries of Latin America, 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.330
 the poorest 40% are doing better than the average, 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.000
 which means that this segment is approaching 60% less poor; it is advancing more than the average. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.920
 Consider two countries where the poorest 40% fare worse than the average. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.480
 This is true in India; this is true in China. 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 For me this is a dilemma. 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 This is in a way a criticism for these countries, but countries can come and tell us: 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.980
 "See, our poorest 40% are worse off than average or worse than 60% less poor, 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.400
 but the poorest 40% fare better than the poorest 40% in many other countries. " 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.330
 "If they can grow so well that the less poor end is growing rapidly, why not apply some special political measures? 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.250
 to help raise the poorer end a little faster? " 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.250
 I love deductive reasoning. 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.250
 Economics is a rare combination of a little math, a lot of reasoning, and also reflections on everyday life. 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 After studying economics in London, I returned to India and learned about development economics in the streets, 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.880
 conversing with a vendor about his arguments as to why he was selling what he was selling, 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.780
 where I was selling it, adjusting that in the jigsaw puzzle of life, and these were experiences. 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.240
 As an analyst you can not allow emotions to cloud your observations, 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.000
 but you must recognize that the people you are studying 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.709
 they are not only doing deductive reasoning, but they are full of emotions, 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.270
 full of anxieties, feelings of love and hate. 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.810
 And these elements begin to displace the concrete figures and decision making. 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.650
 And that, in my opinion, is what makes economics a fascinating discipline. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.650
