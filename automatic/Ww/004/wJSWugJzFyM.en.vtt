00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
on a dime we got the quick change

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.340 
on a dime we got the quick change
differential<00:02:25.880> got<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.000> mounted<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:27.600> had

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
differential got it mounted in there had

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.810 
differential got it mounted in there had
to<00:02:28.470> cut<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> back<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.220> crossmember<00:02:29.700> out

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to cut the back of the crossmember out

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.699 
to cut the back of the crossmember out
to<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.240> fit<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.500> this

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
to get it to fit in there we put this

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.860 
to get it to fit in there we put this
diff<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.370> two<00:02:32.520> reasons<00:02:32.730> we're<00:02:33.540> making

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
diff in for two reasons we're making

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.900 
diff in for two reasons we're making
more<00:02:34.050> horsepower<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.490> need<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> something

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
more horsepower so we need to something

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.330 
more horsepower so we need to something
that's<00:02:35.970> going<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> handle<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> abuse<00:02:36.660> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that's going to handle the abuse and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.580 
that's going to handle the abuse and
also<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:39.300> got<00:02:39.540> these<00:02:39.750> gears<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> back

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
also it's got these gears in the back

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
also it's got these gears in the back
that<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:41.340> interchangeable<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.810> swap

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that are interchangeable so we can swap

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
that are interchangeable so we can swap
