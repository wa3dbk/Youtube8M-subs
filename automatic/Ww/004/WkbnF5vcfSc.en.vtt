00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.030
 for me 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello sure you've all seen notice 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.820
 and talk about protein shakes 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.109
 but this video is for everyone 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.880
 those who want to earn a little bit of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.320
 muscle mass or define the one that you already have 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 well you know that proteins are 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 they find in food but and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.489
 mainly we are going to talk about the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 protein shakes good smoothies 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.279
 of proteins we can use them with 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 different functions for example we 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.509
 can help when we are in moments 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 for weight loss also as a source 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.110
 of proteins or food in some 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 moment of the day but today mainly 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 what interests us is the other function 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 the one that helps us get strong but 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 I do not think that the shakes of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 proteins are magical evidently there are 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.970
 to train if we do not train to win 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.770
 muscle mass 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.060
 we can never get strong by 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 example on another day where I bought some 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.739
 Very good shoes, very good but I 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.060
 I put them and they did not run alone you understand me 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.980
 true today we are going to focus 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.840
 mainly in two groups in all 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.950
 those that you want to define and in all 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.230
 those who want to win a little 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.550
 more muscle mass first all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 those who want to define or be a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 little bit more marked you have to ensure 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.009
 that the protein contribution is the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.899
 adequate so you have to take as 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.040
 minimum one milkshake after delivering the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.110
 shake after training is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.579
 mandatory second for all those 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.350
 that you want to increase muscle mass 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.150
 then normally 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 you will have to take another shake in some 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 another time of the day because normally 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 between hours at breakfast as it is one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 of the most important moments of the day 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 but do not forget that anyone who 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 practice sports regularly 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.490
 You can also benefit from the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 protein shakes but that already I what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.220
 I'll explain in another video and now I'm going to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.680
 prepare a delicious smoothie 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.119
 today I have chocolate first 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 I recommend that you throw the water in case the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.550
 drying is not too dry so it does not 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.310
 stick 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.660
 the powder we add and while I mix it 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.370
 I remind you that if you liked this 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.960
 video subscribe to my channel and if you have 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.530
 some doubt about the shakes of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.370
 proteins 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 Write me an email to deporte my body 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.970

 delicious chocolate the one I like the most 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.330
 and remember to get or not the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.340
 objectives only depends on you 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.340
 of that until next time
