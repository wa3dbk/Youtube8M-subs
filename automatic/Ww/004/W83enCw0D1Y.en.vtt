00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone I'm here again in this video to answer a member of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.590
 forum a map points f 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.400
 kim simply asked who were their authors the limits of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.929
 this elevator 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 so for those who have not seen the previous video 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.969
 m she is available in my chain 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 it is an elevator is realized using the mode 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.279
 and I realized here 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.179
 the elevator 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.639
 with its maximum height and we can see that it is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.520
 I want to point out that the situation is moving forward with the previous video 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.270
 yielded 4 blocks of sand which meant the cabin 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.390
 which are not present because the sand is not subjected to the same gravity 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 that player and we were not going at all is possible 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.430
 for any type of displacement I'm going to perform jambart 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.430
 abby wambach 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.800
 so at least three under the shock of the heroes 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 at the maximum height of the map 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.350
 obviously the elevator of this size 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 can all be realized 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.830
 subsoil 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 all rest will you come from room 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880
 just as ci as observers 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.030
 I'm going to jump and let myself die 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.780
 you realize 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450
 second type of displacement 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.870
 these four groups 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.130
 the player therefore fights 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.830
 piston 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.540
 nine are in blocked mode in rubles the ball lift failure released 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.190
 what will allow me 2 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.649
 others now I'm going to achieve the third type of foot movement 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 Jojo 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.730
 to achieve the fourth title of displacement which is 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.670
 I do not see in what calpine down 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.900
 to go back com in the previous video using the elevator 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.560
 but not to note that these chains to well show cocoon aaron win a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 precious time 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.719
 so heyer elevator obviously very advantageous 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.999
 because time is precious like graphite 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.499
 you must know 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.499
 it's really long 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.619
 jarry poro 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.429
 now that realize 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.879
 fourth type of displacement 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.179
 there was the call of the elevator 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.529
 but the pistons 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.509
 the blocks 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
 I do not have any more 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.609
 arrived downstairs 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.069
 m thank you all first look 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.339
 this video add-on 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.489
 the shooting report in parentheses 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.459
 that the tutorial will no longer be available 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.009
 know tomorrow evening 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.939
 for this reason wish 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:01.909
 this is said
