00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's a good card I guess for this day um

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's a good card I guess for this day um
you<00:01:48.000> click<00:01:48.180> through<00:01:48.329> wildfire<00:01:49.100> wildfire<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
you click through wildfire wildfire you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.810 
you click through wildfire wildfire you
destroy<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> blaze<00:01:52.049> accelerator<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.640> then

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
destroy a blaze accelerator and then

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.340 
destroy a blaze accelerator and then
destroy<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.299> monsters<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> field<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
destroy all monsters on the field and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
destroy all monsters on the field and
then<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> special<00:01:55.979> summon<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.310> wildfire<00:01:56.759> token

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
then you special summon a wildfire token

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.380 
then you special summon a wildfire token
with<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> thousand<00:01:57.659> attack

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
with a thousand attack

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
with a thousand attack
so<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.450> basically<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.260> four<00:02:01.470> dark<00:02:01.650> holes<00:02:01.830> in

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so you basically like four dark holes in

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.680 
so you basically like four dark holes in
here<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.940> can't<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.240> avoided<00:02:03.479> with
