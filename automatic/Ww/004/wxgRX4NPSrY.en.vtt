that I have now many of you asked me how
long<00:00:10.679> does<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:10.950> take<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.490> an<00:00:11.550> orchid<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.030> get

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
long does it take for an orchid to get

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.419 
long does it take for an orchid to get
adjusted<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> new<00:00:13.290> environment<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
adjusted to a new environment and I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.580 
adjusted to a new environment and I
always<00:00:14.610> say<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.030> takes<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.450> few<00:00:15.630> months<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.440> if

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
always say it takes a few months but if

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800 
always say it takes a few months but if

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
nothing happens in about six months

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
nothing happens in about six months
there<00:00:19.080> could<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.410> something<00:00:19.680> wrong<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
there could be something wrong with the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.179 
there could be something wrong with the
roots<00:00:20.520> now<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> story<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
roots now the story with this one is

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
roots now the story with this one is
that<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> purchased<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> autumn<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> last

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that I purchased it in autumn of last

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.920 
that I purchased it in autumn of last
year<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.490> flora<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:26.970> last<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.390> long<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
year the flora didn't last so long and I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.839 
year the flora didn't last so long and I
didn't<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> cause<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.670> then

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
didn't know what the cause was and then

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
didn't know what the cause was and then
I<00:00:29.880> discovered<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.660> pseudo<00:00:30.929> bulb<00:00:31.080> was

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
I discovered this pseudo bulb was

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.799 
I discovered this pseudo bulb was
rotting<00:00:31.949> anyway<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.540> problematic

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
rotting anyway it was a bit problematic

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.389 
rotting anyway it was a bit problematic
this<00:00:34.620> orchid<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> decided<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> repot<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
this orchid so I decided to repot it

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
this orchid so I decided to repot it
disinfected<00:00:38.399> try<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> stop<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.680> fungal

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
disinfected try to stop the fungal

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.340 
disinfected try to stop the fungal
infection<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.059> did<00:00:42.300> manage<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> stop<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
infection and I did manage to stop it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
infection and I did manage to stop it
the<00:00:43.559> rot<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> roots<00:00:45.300> were<00:00:45.450> not

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the rot here but the roots were not

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
the rot here but the roots were not
doing<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.320> great<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.370> reported<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
doing so great even if I reported it and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200 
doing so great even if I reported it and
since<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.100> six<00:00:50.579> months<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
since then for about six months it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
since then for about six months it
didn't<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.840> anything<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.739> stood<00:00:53.070> there

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
didn't do anything it just stood there

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.080 
didn't do anything it just stood there
so<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> sulking<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> bad<00:00:55.699> but<00:00:56.699> today

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so a sulking really really bad but today

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
so a sulking really really bad but today
as<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:58.949> worried<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
as I got really worried about it I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.299 
as I got really worried about it I
started<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.300> examine<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.739> discovered

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
started to examine it and I discovered

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
started to examine it and I discovered
that<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.059> circuit<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.420> trying<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> produce<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that the circuit is trying to produce a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310 
that the circuit is trying to produce a
new<00:01:04.559> suitable<00:01:05.040> right<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> tiny

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
new suitable right here and also a tiny

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980 
new suitable right here and also a tiny
little<00:01:07.740> new<00:01:08.060> offshoot<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.720> enough

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little new offshoot it's not enough

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.500 
little new offshoot it's not enough
shoot<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> new<00:01:10.740> root<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:11.970> root<00:01:12.270> tip

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
shoot it's a new root you know root tip

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230 
shoot it's a new root you know root tip
here<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.380> gives<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.220> hope<00:01:14.460> because

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
here which gives me some hope because

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
here which gives me some hope because
these<00:01:15.630> roots<00:01:15.960> looked<00:01:16.409> terrible<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.280> wasn't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
these roots looked terrible I wasn't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
these roots looked terrible I wasn't
sure<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.270> they<00:01:18.420> were<00:01:18.479> alive<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.229> were

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
sure if they were alive but they were

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.740 
sure if they were alive but they were
pretty<00:01:19.650> stiff<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.880> left<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
pretty stiff so I just left them on and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.039 
pretty stiff so I just left them on and
yeah<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.979> starting<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> grow

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
yeah I think it's starting to grow

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
yeah I think it's starting to grow
finally<00:01:25.049> after<00:01:25.290> six<00:01:25.740> months<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
finally after six months now there is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
finally after six months now there is
some<00:01:27.420> knowledge<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> internet<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.250> by

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
some knowledge on the internet that by

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
some knowledge on the internet that by
foliate<00:01:30.030> Callias<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> ones<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
foliate Callias which are the ones that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
foliate Callias which are the ones that
have<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.610> leaves<00:01:32.939> per<00:01:33.299> suitable<00:01:33.780> seemed<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
have two leaves per suitable seemed to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.760 
have two leaves per suitable seemed to
take<00:01:35.700> quite<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> long<00:01:36.390> time<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.350> adjusted

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
take quite a long time to get adjusted

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.399 
take quite a long time to get adjusted
to<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> new<00:01:38.009> environment<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.570> Nate<00:01:39.869> didn't<00:01:40.229> know

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to a new environment no Nate didn't know

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.520 
to a new environment no Nate didn't know
if<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.070> necessarily<00:01:41.100> true<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> might

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
if it was necessarily true but it might

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
if it was necessarily true but it might
be<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.270> because

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
be now I don't know if it was because

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
be now I don't know if it was because
the<00:01:45.780> soy<00:01:45.960> kid<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.439> sick<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.430> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the soy kid was really sick or it's just

foliated<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.560> worried

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
foliated and yeah I was really worried

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
foliated and yeah I was really worried
about<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.880> lovely<00:01:54.149> Callie

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
about it because it's a lovely Callie

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.490 
about it because it's a lovely Callie
actually<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.409> smells<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:56.189> nice<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.840> today

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
actually it smells really nice but today

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
actually it smells really nice but today
I<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.130> ray<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> hope<00:01:59.640> with<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.329> new

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
