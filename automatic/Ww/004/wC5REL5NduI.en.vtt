showdown<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.050> believe<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.739> actually

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
showdown and I believe this was actually

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
showdown and I believe this was actually
like<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> third<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:41.850> fourth<00:00:42.149> battle<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.510> found

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
like the third or fourth battle I found

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
like the third or fourth battle I found
so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> didn't<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> waste<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> 30-40

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so I didn't have to waste like 30-40

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.209 
so I didn't have to waste like 30-40
minutes<00:00:45.300> trying<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.530> ol<00:00:46.710> battle

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
minutes trying to get a good ol battle

into my lawdy house which is possibly
the<00:02:01.890> biggest<00:02:02.399> threat<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.030> his<00:02:03.180> team<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.719> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the biggest threat to his team and I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.480 
the biggest threat to his team and I
don't<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.680> strip<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.159> Draco

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
don't want to go strip to the Draco

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
don't want to go strip to the Draco
meteor<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.360> he<00:02:06.750> does<00:02:07.049> still<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
meteor just because he does still have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
meteor just because he does still have
that<00:02:07.590> fortress<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.250> means<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.819> i<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.360> for

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that fortress which means if i go for

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
that fortress which means if i go for
the<00:02:09.569> Draco<00:02:09.840> meteor<00:02:10.050> it'll<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.709> basically<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the Draco meteor it'll be basically a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.370 
the Draco meteor it'll be basically a
pointless<00:02:12.150> attacking<00:02:12.780> move

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
pointless attacking move

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.720 
pointless attacking move
so<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.500> decided<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> go<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> size<00:02:14.370> shock<00:02:14.580> as

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so I decided to go for the size shock as

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
so I decided to go for the size shock as
he<00:02:14.820> brings<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> God<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.630> tell<00:02:15.810> from<00:02:16.410> prior

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
he brings in the God to tell from prior

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740 
he brings in the God to tell from prior
experience<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.310> numbers<00:02:17.640> God<00:02:17.850> tells<00:02:18.180> our<00:02:18.330> specs

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
experience I numbers God tells our specs

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
experience I numbers God tells our specs

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
to then knock him out with the second

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.820 
to then knock him out with the second
fire<00:06:03.450> punch<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.930> that's<00:06:04.320> going<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.500> be<00:06:04.680> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
fire punch and that's going to be the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.010 
fire punch and that's going to be the
very<00:06:05.040> narrow<00:06:05.400> one<00:06:05.729> no<00:06:05.880> victory<00:06:06.330> in<00:06:06.510> my<00:06:06.750> favor

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
very narrow one no victory in my favor

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.110 
very narrow one no victory in my favor
now<00:06:07.590> this<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:08.010> where<00:06:08.130> him<00:06:08.370> not<00:06:08.580> going<00:06:08.880> for

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
now this is where him not going for

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.940 
now this is where him not going for
sucker<00:06:09.390> punch<00:06:09.630> earlier<00:06:10.020> on<00:06:10.080> my<00:06:10.320> jirachi<00:06:10.650> might

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
sucker punch earlier on my jirachi might

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.770 
sucker punch earlier on my jirachi might
have<00:06:11.070> actually<00:06:11.220> mattered<00:06:11.790> because<00:06:12.210> he

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
have actually mattered because he

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.969 
have actually mattered because he
probably<00:06:13.080> could<00:06:13.350> have<00:06:13.380> got<00:06:13.560> off<00:06:13.680> enough

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
probably could have got off enough

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.800 
probably could have got off enough
damage<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.490> point<00:06:14.729> where<00:06:14.910> his<00:06:15.360> venusaur

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
damage to the point where his venusaur

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.120 
damage to the point where his venusaur
would<00:06:15.990> have<00:06:16.080> been<00:06:16.169> able<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:16.500> actually<00:06:16.650> knock

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
would have been able to actually knock

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.010 
would have been able to actually knock
me<00:06:17.340> out<00:06:17.370> with<00:06:17.700> the<00:06:17.790> hidden<00:06:18.000> power<00:06:18.150> fire<00:06:18.360> but<00:06:18.900> if

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
me out with the hidden power fire but if

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.240 
me out with the hidden power fire but if
he<00:06:19.110> did<00:06:19.350> do<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.530> then<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:19.950> would<00:06:19.979> have

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
he did do that then I would have

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.560 
he did do that then I would have
actually<00:06:20.370> gone<00:06:20.669> for<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.000> iron<00:06:21.210> head<00:06:21.419> as

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
actually gone for the iron head as

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.180 
actually gone for the iron head as
opposed<00:06:22.169> to<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.380> fire<00:06:22.560> punch<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.040> then<00:06:23.160> I

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
opposed to the fire punch and then I

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.710 
opposed to the fire punch and then I
could<00:06:23.400> have<00:06:23.490> flinched<00:06:23.700> him<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.150> then<00:06:24.510> knocked

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
could have flinched him and then knocked

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.210 
could have flinched him and then knocked
him<00:06:24.870> out<00:06:24.960> with<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.169> second<00:06:25.560> iron<00:06:25.710> head<00:06:25.919> so<00:06:26.100> in

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
him out with a second iron head so in

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.159 
him out with a second iron head so in
the<00:06:26.280> end<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.729> don't<00:06:27.150> really<00:06:27.390> know<00:06:27.570> how<00:06:27.600> much<00:06:27.960> him

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
the end I don't really know how much him

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.600 
the end I don't really know how much him
not<00:06:28.380> sucker<00:06:28.770> punching<00:06:29.130> really<00:06:29.370> ends<00:06:29.490> up

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
not sucker punching really ends up

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.950
