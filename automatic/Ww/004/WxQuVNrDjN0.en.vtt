00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that his development should take place

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
in the front like that is not the right

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.440 
in the front like that is not the right
position<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:15.869> Ryan<00:01:16.170> Bertram<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> course

anyway so first half done pretty

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.539 
anyway so first half done pretty
depressing<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.290> was<00:01:40.290> almost<00:01:40.710> reminding<00:01:41.400> me

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
depressing and was almost reminding me

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.380 
depressing and was almost reminding me
of<00:01:41.579> Brentford<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.970> we

of Brentford but then then then then we

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
of Brentford but then then then then we
come<00:01:45.630> back<00:01:45.710> after<00:01:46.710> halftime<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
come back after halftime and we're in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.340 
come back after halftime and we're in
the<00:01:47.610> second<00:01:47.939> half<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.110> though<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the second half and it was as though the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
the second half and it was as though the
Chelsea<00:01:49.710> boys<00:01:49.890> hit<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.670> major

quantities of Red Bull in the back

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.819 
quantities of Red Bull in the back
