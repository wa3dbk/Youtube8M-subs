00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.059 
the naked one the things that I didn't
like<00:04:07.979> about<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.759> was

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
like about that is it was

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.220 
like about that is it was
magnetic<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:10.420> when<00:04:10.689> I<00:04:10.719> would<00:04:10.900> take<00:04:11.079> it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
magnetic so when I would take it

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.199 
magnetic so when I would take it
traveling<00:04:11.379> it<00:04:11.920> would<00:04:12.159> always<00:04:12.430> open<00:04:13.060> up

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
traveling it would always open up

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.229 
traveling it would always open up
somehow<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.680> naked<00:04:15.010> too<00:04:15.249> i<00:04:15.280> really<00:04:15.879> like<00:04:16.060> it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
somehow the naked too i really like it

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.529 
somehow the naked too i really like it
because<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:16.660> closed<00:04:17.139> together<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.910> stayed

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
because it closed together so it stayed

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.870 
because it closed together so it stayed
shut<00:04:19.750> when<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.440> traveled<00:04:20.889> with<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.340> also<00:04:21.639> have

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
really love that palette also this to me

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.719 
really love that palette also this to me
was<00:04:33.490> worth<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.419> was<00:04:34.449> worth<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.720> buy<00:04:34.990> for<00:04:35.050> me

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
was worth it it was worth the buy for me

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.670 
was worth it it was worth the buy for me
so<00:04:36.729> like<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.300> said<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.960> know<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
so like I said you know here the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.529 
so like I said you know here the
swatches<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.750> all<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.349> decide<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.849> I<00:04:43.090> think

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
swatches you all can decide but I think

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.409 
swatches you all can decide but I think
it's<00:04:44.229> very<00:04:44.560> nice<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.370> like<00:04:45.729> i<00:04:45.820> said<00:04:45.880> i<00:04:46.030> have<00:04:46.300> it

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
it's very nice and like i said i have it

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.969 
it's very nice and like i said i have it
on<00:04:46.599> you<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:46.990> be<00:04:47.199> very<00:04:47.229> careful<00:04:47.620> with<00:04:47.860> the

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
on you have to be very careful with the

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.010 
on you have to be very careful with the
blush<00:04:48.190> because<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:48.849> very<00:04:49.030> pigmented<00:04:49.780> but

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
blush because it is very pigmented but

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.560 
blush because it is very pigmented but
that<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.560> not<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.770> bad<00:04:51.070> thing<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> very
