00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.240 

I<00:00:07.950> think<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.080> contemporary<00:00:10.080> society<00:00:10.320> there's

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
I think in contemporary society there's

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.299 
I think in contemporary society there's
a<00:00:11.630> paucity<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.660> practical<00:00:13.590> skills<00:00:13.889> training

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
a paucity of practical skills training

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.430 
a paucity of practical skills training
so<00:00:14.520> we<00:00:14.790> no<00:00:14.940> longer<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.420> homak<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:16.080> don't<00:00:16.260> have

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
so we no longer have homak we don't have

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.660 
so we no longer have homak we don't have
shop<00:00:16.850> some<00:00:17.850> schools<00:00:18.120> don't<00:00:18.240> even<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.630> recess

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
and in fast-paced life there's very

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.160 
and in fast-paced life there's very
rarely<00:00:23.390> opportunities<00:00:24.390> i<00:00:24.540> think<00:00:24.750> for
