00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.910 
and then you have to light the talent
and<00:00:18.630> try<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> avoid<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.230> many<00:00:19.350> shadows<00:00:19.740> as

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.450 
me to illustrate this product is to show
it<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.150> action

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.740 

okay<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.520> we're<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.879> pretty<00:00:35.910> standard<00:00:36.510> room

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
okay so we're in a pretty standard room

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
okay so we're in a pretty standard room
very<00:00:37.559> small<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> ceiling<00:00:38.730> height<00:00:38.879> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
very small with a ceiling height of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
very small with a ceiling height of
about<00:00:39.149> seven<00:00:39.480> foot<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.170> ideal

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
about seven foot not your ideal

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.259 
about seven foot not your ideal
chromakey<00:00:41.040> studio<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:41.970> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> make

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
chromakey studio but we're going to make

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.639 
chromakey studio but we're going to make
it<00:00:42.420> work<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.019> we're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it work and we're going to do that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
it work and we're going to do that
because<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.489> gray<00:00:45.000> background<00:00:45.239> behind

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
because we have a gray background behind

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
because we have a gray background behind
us<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.500> key<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.949> is<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
us and the key to this is this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
us and the key to this is this
background<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.420> using<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> same

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
background it's using the same

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.049 
background it's using the same
technology<00:00:49.470> as<00:00:49.559> high<00:00:49.800> visibility<00:00:50.220> reflective

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
technology as high visibility reflective

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
technology as high visibility reflective
vests<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.659> so<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.589> light

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
vests and so when you put a light

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
vests and so when you put a light
against<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.730> bounces<00:00:54.089> straight<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.540> at

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
against it get bounces straight back at

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
against it get bounces straight back at
the<00:00:54.960> camera<00:00:55.290> I<00:00:55.470> can<00:00:55.890> illustrate<00:00:56.040> this<00:00:56.430> with

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the camera I can illustrate this with

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
the camera I can illustrate this with
then<00:00:56.940> who's<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> light<00:00:57.780> ring

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
then who's going to put the light ring

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:58.910 
then who's going to put the light ring
in<00:00:58.140> front<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.530> camera

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
in front of the camera

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
in front of the camera
certainly<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> gray<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.000> green<00:01:00.110> I'm<00:01:01.110> using

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
certainly the gray to green I'm using

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
certainly the gray to green I'm using
Annie<00:01:01.589> x1<00:01:01.979> here<00:01:02.220> but<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.519> can<00:01:02.640> work<00:01:02.790> with<00:01:02.940> any

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
Annie x1 here but it can work with any

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.240 
Annie x1 here but it can work with any
camera<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:03.809> got<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> 77<00:01:04.470> millimeter<00:01:04.949> ring

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
camera I've got a 77 millimeter ring

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
camera I've got a 77 millimeter ring
attached<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.259> fit<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> light<00:01:07.770> ring

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
attached to it so you fit the light ring

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.430 
attached to it so you fit the light ring
on<00:01:08.690> screw<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.810> attachment<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.259> are

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
on screw the attachment and then you are

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.279 
on screw the attachment and then you are
turn<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.940> now<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.660> green

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
turn it on and we now have a green

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.650 
turn it on and we now have a green
chroma<00:01:16.740> key<00:01:16.920> light<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.910> you<00:01:17.940> can<00:01:18.149> adjust<00:01:18.240> at

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
chroma key light which you can adjust at

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.200 
chroma key light which you can adjust at
empty<00:01:19.110> okay<00:01:19.830> we've<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.130> killed<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> ambient

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
empty okay we've now killed the ambient

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
empty okay we've now killed the ambient
light<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.660> I<00:01:22.050> can<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> turn<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
light and I can get down to turn on the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
light and I can get down to turn on the
light<00:01:23.160> controller<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:23.940> now<00:01:24.179> see<00:01:24.450> that

light controller you can now see that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
light controller you can now see that
the<00:01:24.720> gray<00:01:24.899> is<00:01:25.170> green<00:01:25.560> certain<00:01:26.159> these

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the gray is green certain these

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
the gray is green certain these
adjusting<00:01:26.700> intensity<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.690> down<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
adjusting intensity up and down and you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
adjusting intensity up and down and you
can<00:01:28.289> see<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.830> change<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.550> green

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
can see that the change of the green

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
can see that the change of the green
behind<00:01:29.940> me<00:01:30.240> you've<00:01:30.929> really<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.319> to<00:01:31.380> be

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
behind me you've really got to be

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.320 
behind me you've really got to be
careful<00:01:31.679> with<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.190> intensity<00:01:32.550> of<00:01:32.850> blue<00:01:33.149> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
careful with the intensity of blue and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.389 
careful with the intensity of blue and
green<00:01:33.600> light<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> use<00:01:34.319> especially<00:01:35.100> if

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
green light that you use especially if

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.920 
green light that you use especially if
you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.670> anything<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.179> shot<00:01:36.479> there's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
a bit of a problem no of course because

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.910 
a bit of a problem no of course because
we<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> green<00:01:48.390> background<00:01:48.600> behind<00:01:48.899> us<00:01:49.290> so

we have a green background behind us so
what<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.759> actually<00:01:51.240> change<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
what we can do is actually change the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
what we can do is actually change the
ring<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> blue<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.250> we'll<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.549> switch

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ring to blue if then we'll just switch

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
ring to blue if then we'll just switch
over<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.060> us<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:54.860> normally<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.100> you've<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
over for us now normally if you've got a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
over for us now normally if you've got a
painted<00:01:57.240> background<00:01:57.659> studio<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.469> think

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
painted background studio you can think

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
painted background studio you can think
you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.950> change<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.490> we<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.270> don't<00:02:00.420> have

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you can change so now we have don't have

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.639 
you can change so now we have don't have
a<00:02:00.540> problem<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.289> probably<00:02:01.469> have

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
a problem there but we probably have

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350
