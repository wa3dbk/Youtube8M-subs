float over to get involved my offensive

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.059 
float over to get involved my offensive
lineman<00:03:42.299> would<00:03:42.449> miraculously<00:03:43.290> release<00:03:43.769> this

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
lineman would miraculously release this

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.610

how<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> k-8<00:05:28.720> does<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.080> little<00:05:29.169> better<00:05:29.440> I

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
how to k-8 does it a little better I

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.580 
how to k-8 does it a little better I
realize<00:05:30.310> this<00:05:30.520> is<00:05:30.700> only<00:05:30.820> one<00:05:31.090> example<00:05:31.530> but<00:05:32.530> I

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
realize this is only one example but I

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.350 
realize this is only one example but I
think<00:05:32.680> as<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:33.070> showed<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.970> is<00:05:34.180> one

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
think as I showed you this is one

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.810 
think as I showed you this is one
example<00:05:34.780> where<00:05:35.440> two<00:05:35.530> three<00:05:35.830> four<00:05:36.040> five<00:05:36.370> things

this<00:05:37.690> game<00:05:37.930> does<00:05:38.200> differently<00:05:38.740> not<00:05:39.130> just<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
this game does differently not just the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.270 
this game does differently not just the
blocking<00:05:39.760> it's<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.780> interaction<00:05:41.530> with<00:05:42.070> your

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280

it's<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.630> over<00:05:43.930> pursuit<00:05:44.380> when<00:05:44.620> blockers<00:05:45.070> get

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
it's the over pursuit when blockers get

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.990 
it's the over pursuit when blockers get
in<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.580> way

it's the way the tackles are missed and
it's<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:48.940> way<00:05:49.060> two<00:05:49.120> players<00:05:49.810> engage<00:05:50.410> from
