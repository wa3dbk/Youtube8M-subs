00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello today let's talk about the role of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 family in the education of the children 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 You know I've always had it. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.929
 a view of the human being as a being 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 biopsychosocial whether we rely on 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 surgery of a genetics and other 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.430
 factors and born that not only genetic 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.580
 in what happens in the very condition 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.650
 as female problems is during the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 life between grandsons also interferes with 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.010
 which will be the way of being and the psyche 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.840
 of people is sometimes not so much because 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.260
 interference as people think 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.290
 what things the tone but the exfoliations and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.320
 circulation is blood 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 physical problems that can determine 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 problems very serious from the point 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 view is that I apply in the future 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.420
 we depend on some 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.449
 that occurs over time 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.969
 years of training some diseases 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 physical limitations that may arise from 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.689
 injuries and difficulties of order 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.330
 practice with diseases 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.010
 chronic or prolonged burns 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 Finally, all the problems that can 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.729
 happen to everyone 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 we obviously depend on the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.080
 circumstance of the family environment and we 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.900
 living a certain culture then we 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.159
 We are bio psycho social nee and kiko 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.310
 it would be really 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 the influence of the family and is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 the influence of culture begins every time 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 earlier by means of the means of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.490
 communication through the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.130
 internet games that children 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.409
 participate through television 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 where they are spending in this set 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.049
 more than five hours a day and so and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
 has a very important influence and 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.659
 whether or not all those vehicles 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.939
 standard living patterns pass 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.909
 Philosophy of life people sometimes 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.790
 have recognized and perceived that it is the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.430
 The role of the family has only decreased 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.469
 would be a psychological aspect the years of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.750
 training the influence of parents 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.500
 circumstance and values 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.010
 morals that this seeks to convey to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 biology has its foot 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.110
 I was a very strong weight but not so 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.409
 strong as you imagine then there are 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.540
 genetic tendencies unless only 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.870
 their genetic tendencies are very 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.970
 strong when it comes to very 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.500
 extreme special gifts or 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.629
 very radical peculiarities are 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.970
 losing its beauty or extreme ugliness 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.860
 in both cases it certainly interferes 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.950
 much of what the person is going to be 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.140
 then it is certain capacity or greater or 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 to deal with fear when it is too 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.730
 lack of fear also greatly interferes with 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.760
 personality formation was negative 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.620
 even people with very specific gifts 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.049
 about drawing music also has 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.239
 almost their destiny determined to 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.209
 these innate gifts and facilities 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.829
 biology is indicative of some 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.859
 tendencies that may or may not be 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.420
 stimulated by culture and truth 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.389
 and family life 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.579
 the family is has a weight and an influence 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.769
 everyone recognizes less and less 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.769
 precisely because the pressure of the culture 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.410
 with its variables is very strong and 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.169
 all of them well- known consumerism 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.359
 fierce competition for success and 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.239
 fame at any price all these being 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.459
 things that are not always so welcome 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.549
 and not always great generator is 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.349
 Happiness, this is the water. 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.590
 this is the broth on which families 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.359
 They receive their baby their children 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.329
 and it is in this context that they have to 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.000
 try to make some part of your 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.370
 influence and is not easy because it comes with 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.079
 biology have so traveling sus has 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 a way of being expensive children because the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.269
 from the 23 years of age of the plum 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.730
 each one of their own 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.709
 in your reflections your views 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.609
 which also greatly interferes in 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.669
 result 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.010
 then where the family is and why the 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.709
 family today neither weighs the family in 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.569
 general thinks little when parents who 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.489
 father and mother are very different in 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.769
 in terms of values, the higher the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.169
 differences in values between father and mother 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.180
 when the parent, for example, is more rigid 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.959
 but demanding the more tolerant mother more 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.780
 when the father is to be strict and 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.330
 severe in punishment, the mother feels sorry for 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.919
 child and does 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.810
 waiting when the father wants the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.310
 Child is crying until they sleep tomorrow. 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.259
 I think what is most important is that it is the aaa 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.719
 getting pity and more important 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.909
 then go to welcome the children and there 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.860
 small discrepancies at the beginning and 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.659
 later becomes larger because the father is 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.580
 with a school achievement 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.289
 more tolerant or vice versa 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.409
 though otherwise I am not 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.939
 speaking that the father always the most rigorous 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.039
 evidence the child realizes that there is 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.650
 double command from her point of view 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.960
 very early than the command 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.300
 means no command in means 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.060
 that it can then include and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.879
 external values list products 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.009
 She then happens to be the one we'll see if she 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.229
 queen of her own life and the 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.020
 sometimes even interfering with the 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.659
 being at home with this does not exist as the 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.120
 family to influence how much more fragile 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:20.639
 this system and this confusion of values 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.699
 inside their house for small things 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.529
 but then also by something bigger 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.689
 of course this value is included 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.330
 also very much the way of being 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.529
 that the father's way of being of the mother 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.449
 evidently this child will grow 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.520
 more and more on the influence of 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.379
 culture will become more like everything 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.490
 world and more living according to the 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.219
 cultural pattern 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.289
 so that the family has the weight and 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.569
 importance on a day like today's 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.870
 the pressure in the culture is so strong only 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.550
 there is a way father and mother are 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.180
 extremely attuned the principles in 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.060
 values 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.000
 the affinities of posture between the father 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.279
 and the mother defined a unique way of being and 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.879
 to behave and a single mode of 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:05.520
 demand and lay claim to the 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.370
 children or their children is the only 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.229
 how these children really 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.529
 learn to respect these values and 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:16.050
 they end up following them obviously always 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.120
 under the influence is also the culture of 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.949
 their existing natural characteristics 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.520
 minimum set of consolidated amounts 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:26.310
 which is most of all was how the 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.289
 standard homogeneity between the father and 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.479
 mother father and mother were discrepant nuno 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.319
 not in their positions in relation to 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.960
 education 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.770
 worth the role of culture or be the 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.050
 God willing 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.210
 if father and mother was very homogeneous and very 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.159
 consistently strong defense of the 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.919
 their points of view and the two together 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:47.349
 always together so they interfere and 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.529
 enough in the end result of education 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:53.349
 even in today's times 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:55.809
 this would be our last concessions 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:58.419
 this year 2012 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:00.159
 I wish you happiness for the next 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.039
 year and I hope you continue 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:04.599
 accompanying and signing up here in the 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.020
 our youtube channel 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.020
 to the next
