while we need some builds done in it and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
while we need some builds done in it and
we<00:00:44.399> need<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> configure<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.450> last<00:00:45.690> stuff<00:00:46.670> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we need to configure the last stuff the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.190 
we need to configure the last stuff the
creative<00:00:48.059> server<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:49.020> come

pretty far we also need to build on
there<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.530> probably<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.370> further

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
there but it's probably a little further
