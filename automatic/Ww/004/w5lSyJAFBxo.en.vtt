00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.670
 So you have serious differences 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 In any case, ever with me 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 this motorcycle in things chassis the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 chassis is revised throughout 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 a little firmer for the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 race track what you do not on the street 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.660
 so then here are other handlebars 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 mounted to have a different power 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 and sit relatively far down 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.590
 I have a one brake lever here to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 I can do it from the left hand 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 when i run through the race 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.469
 I can lose the pressure a bit 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.719
 because here I post manually 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 we always saw the best brake pressure 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 Other footpegs the slightly higher 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.309
 are and a little further back with it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.039
 one on the whole a substantial 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 gets a sportier sitting position and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.850
 that makes it as already said 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370
 much easier with and on the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.520
 motorcycle work yes we have one 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 a little modified exhaust system that is 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.320
 such small things I actually 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.660
 every racetrack freshman too close 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 can put it here and there at least once 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 handlebar footpegs are all so parts 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 that actually make it up 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 to feel good on the motorcycle 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.729
 race track because it is easy to the road 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 in other things are the mirrors 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.369
 Of course, that's not what they are 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.189
 Of course, it's my turn because I'm using it 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 instructors drivers and then they have to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.159
 usually well off the motorcycle has 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.350
 no more lighting 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 there are no parts flying around 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.729
 So the motorcycle is like that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 actually already for a race sport 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.570
 rebuilt 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 yes the disguise as I said as you do 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 Here you see, they have no headlights 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 more in it is a so-called gfk 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 Racing disguise is easier 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 as an original and closes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.360
 of course, then the openings where it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.950
 usually the presiding 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 is also max is relatively cheap falls 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.040
 This is the first broken tire 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.030
 Of course you will be on the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.530
 race course, of course, not with 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.670
 conventional tires on the street 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 to be moved are natural 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 special tires in different 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.610
 mixes in the supersport segment speaks 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.610
 600 there you drive profiled tires 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.780
 but with profiling and at 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.210
 the big classes you just drop 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.399
 slicks and that 's actually one too 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 often forgotten, too 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.810
 at just newcomers to theirs 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.890
 come here and drive 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.270
 then just a few rounds on the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.720
 ring will be a bit automatic 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.250
 more quickly 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.830
 and there is the puncto mature actually 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.410
 the point that will always be forgotten 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.030
 Air pressure are all points the beginners 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.040
 if you do not blame them sensibly 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.060
 can do it wrong and often 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 unfortunately then comes to a crash
