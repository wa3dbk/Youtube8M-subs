00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
out of those 200 people of course you

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.160 
out of those 200 people of course you
might<00:00:55.640> think<00:00:56.000> looks<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.390> little<00:00:56.539> unfair

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
might think looks a little unfair

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.529 
might think looks a little unfair
because<00:00:57.559> everyone<00:00:58.340> will<00:00:58.550> have<00:00:58.699> progressed<00:00:59.270> to

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
because everyone will have progressed to

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.910 
because everyone will have progressed to
different<00:00:59.930> stages<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.680> game

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
different stages of the game

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.160 
different stages of the game
meaning<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.879> further<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.480> have<00:01:02.629> progressed

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
meaning the further you have progressed

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.439 
meaning the further you have progressed
into<00:01:03.500> more<00:01:03.680> relics<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.309> have<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:05.239> better

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
into more relics you have the better

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.810 
into more relics you have the better
your<00:01:05.720> chances<00:01:06.260> are<00:01:06.440> of<00:01:06.500> getting<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.160> top<00:01:07.430> spot

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
your chances are of getting the top spot

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.990 
your chances are of getting the top spot
at<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.930> time<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.470> could<00:01:09.950> only<00:01:10.130> reach<00:01:10.520> up<00:01:10.790> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
at this time I could only reach up to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.420 
at this time I could only reach up to
around<00:01:11.300> level<00:01:11.870> 300<00:01:12.560> before<00:01:12.950> having<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
around level 300 before having the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.210 
around level 300 before having the
prestige<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.360> that's<00:01:15.020> probably<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.770> maximum

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
prestige so that's probably the maximum

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.630 
prestige so that's probably the maximum
I<00:01:16.490> could<00:01:16.730> get<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.060> 24<00:01:17.660> hours<00:01:18.220> meanwhile<00:01:19.220> there

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
I could get in 24 hours meanwhile there

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.730 
I could get in 24 hours meanwhile there
are<00:01:19.670> those<00:01:20.060> hardcore<00:01:20.900> players<00:01:21.260> in<00:01:21.590> my

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
are those hardcore players in my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.860 
are those hardcore players in my
tournament<00:01:22.340> bracket<00:01:22.910> with<00:01:23.090> 10,000,000

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
tournament bracket with 10,000,000

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.680 
tournament bracket with 10,000,000
relics<00:01:24.320> who<00:01:24.920> can<00:01:25.190> get<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.550> level<00:01:25.850> two<00:01:26.090> thousand

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
relics who can get to level two thousand

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.950 
relics who can get to level two thousand
and<00:01:26.840> five<00:01:27.050> minutes<00:01:27.440> with<00:01:27.890> their<00:01:28.100> eyes<00:01:28.310> closed

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
and five minutes with their eyes closed

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.110 
and five minutes with their eyes closed
so<00:01:29.960> yeah<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:30.560> guess<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.310> will<00:01:31.490> have<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.880> settle

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
so yeah I guess I will have to settle

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.090 
so yeah I guess I will have to settle
for<00:01:32.300> somewhere<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.290> middle<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> pack

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
for somewhere in the middle of the pack

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.490 
for somewhere in the middle of the pack
for<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.550> tournament<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.990> fair<00:01:36.260> it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
for this tournament but to be fair it's

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.530 
for this tournament but to be fair it's
not<00:01:36.740> really<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.190> big<00:01:37.460> deal<00:01:37.520> because<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
not really a big deal because the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.100 
not really a big deal because the
rewards<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.410> doing<00:01:39.470> them<00:01:39.950> are<00:01:40.070> pretty<00:01:40.340> minor

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
rewards for doing them are pretty minor

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.860 
rewards for doing them are pretty minor
speaking<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.260> rewards<00:01:42.980> what<00:01:43.580> are<00:01:43.760> they<00:01:43.940> well

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
speaking of rewards what are they well

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.170 
speaking of rewards what are they well
for<00:01:45.170> one<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:46.010> get<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> couple<00:01:46.730> of<00:01:46.880> diamonds

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
for one you get a couple of diamonds

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.200 
for one you get a couple of diamonds
which<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:48.140> can<00:01:48.350> use<00:01:48.620> to<00:01:48.890> salvage<00:01:49.370> artifacts

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
which you can use to salvage artifacts

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.080 
which you can use to salvage artifacts
or<00:01:50.360> buy<00:01:50.810> some<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.290> these<00:01:51.500> power-ups<00:01:52.040> which<00:01:52.850> I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
or buy some of these power-ups which I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.240 
or buy some of these power-ups which I
wouldn't<00:01:53.480> recommend<00:01:53.570> buying<00:01:54.380> because<00:01:54.770> they

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
wouldn't recommend buying because they

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.380 
wouldn't recommend buying because they
are<00:01:55.310> pretty<00:01:55.640> useless

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
are pretty useless

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.890 
are pretty useless
you<00:01:57.080> also<00:01:57.290> get<00:01:57.770> few<00:01:57.980> weapon<00:01:58.370> upgrades<00:01:58.900> another

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
you also get few weapon upgrades another

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.050 
you also get few weapon upgrades another
somewhat<00:02:00.500> new<00:02:00.710> feature<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.280> was<00:02:01.490> recently

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
somewhat new feature that was recently
