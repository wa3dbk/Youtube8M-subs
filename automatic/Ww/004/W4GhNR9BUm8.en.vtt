so<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:55.020> driving<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.649> setup<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.390> our

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so we're driving this setup with our

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
so we're driving this setup with our
product<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> VLA<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.190> called<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
product from the VLA that's called the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.830 
product from the VLA that's called the
dip<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.879> me<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:02.480> completely<00:01:03.480> new

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
dip for me and so it's completely new

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
dip for me and so it's completely new
technology<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.460> different<00:01:06.210> concept

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
technology and also a different concept

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.190 
technology and also a different concept
in<00:01:07.170> terms<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.530> product<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.520> sort<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
in terms of product it's sort of a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
in terms of product it's sort of a
all-in-one<00:01:10.200> box<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.220> say<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> complete

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
all-in-one box I would say it's complete

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.260 
all-in-one box I would say it's complete
audio<00:01:12.060> system<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.159> software<00:01:14.549> driven<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
audio system and it's software driven so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
audio system and it's software driven so
it<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.720> configured<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.470> many<00:01:16.920> different

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it can be configured in many different

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.170 
it can be configured in many different
ways<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.930> 200<00:01:19.680> watt<00:01:20.030> 240<00:01:21.030> watt

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
ways so basically it's 200 watt 240 watt

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.499 
ways so basically it's 200 watt 240 watt
sorry<00:01:21.450> per<00:01:22.080> channel<00:01:22.439> stereo<00:01:23.400> system<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
sorry per channel stereo system but it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
sorry per channel stereo system but it
can<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.869> said<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.710> mono<00:01:26.009> block<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
can be said also as mono block and you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.300 
can be said also as mono block and you
can<00:01:27.210> change<00:01:27.600> two<00:01:27.960> units<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.829> confer

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
can change two units so you can confer

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
can change two units so you can confer
it<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> different<00:01:30.150> ways<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.689> illustrate

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it in different ways so we illustrate

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.510 
it in different ways so we illustrate
this<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.299> with<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.720> unit<00:01:33.930> driving<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.340> two

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this here with one unit driving the two

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
this here with one unit driving the two
speakers<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.030> stereo<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.680> slaved

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
speakers in stereo and we have a slaved

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.990 
speakers in stereo and we have a slaved
unit<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.710> set<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.890> mono<00:01:41.130> block<00:01:41.310> 400

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
unit to this one set as mono block 400

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.569 
unit to this one set as mono block 400
watts<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> drive<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.020> subwoofer<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
watts to drive the subwoofer and we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.389 
watts to drive the subwoofer and we
actually<00:01:45.240> had<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> low-pass<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.170> high-pass

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
actually had a low-pass and high-pass

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.910 
actually had a low-pass and high-pass
processed<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.549> our<00:01:47.700> own<00:01:47.939> DSP<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> we

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
processed in our own DSP here and we

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.389 
processed in our own DSP here and we
feed<00:01:50.220> digital<00:01:50.700> signal<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.680> okay<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
feed digital signal and okay so can you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.280 
feed digital signal and okay so can you
demo<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.390> me<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> show<00:01:54.960> me<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> little

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
demo this for me and show me a little

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
demo this for me and show me a little
bit<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> works<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bit about how it works this is the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.500 
bit about how it works this is the
remote<00:01:58.020> control<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.950> our<00:01:59.130> product

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
remote control of our product

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.070 
remote control of our product
and<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.560> radio<00:02:01.950> laying<00:02:02.220> here<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.050> have

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
and it's radio laying here we we we have

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.280 
and it's radio laying here we we we have
we're<00:02:07.620> gonna<00:02:07.770> push<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.370> bit<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we're gonna push it a little bit so I
