00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.410
 get bored 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 let's continue with the game counter 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 strike with 33 modifies many aspects 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 the same especially enhancing the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.440
 game in team and with a setting 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.570
 excellent placing you in the skin of a 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.460
 member of the special forces 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 experts in the fight against terrorism or in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 also a terrorist against strikes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.380
 is an online shooter that does not commit 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.110
 serious errors in any of the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 key aspects be fans or not this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.600
 classic is essential for 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 competitive users 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.180
 another game that I also thought 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.830
 very good is the operations hebert 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 operation seven is a shooter at first 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.360
 person where you can try to talk 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.280
 intense battles on detailed maps and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.260
 originals like on alcatraz island 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.450
 an Olympic stadium or tunnels of 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.130
 Subway a split room is very easy and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 can do you while others are 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.759
 playing will start the operation option 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.800
 seven offers a lot of frenetic action and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.570
 disordered the effects of sounds are 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.310
 faithful to reality but the engine 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 graphic suffers a bit when passing 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 the years but good that does not matter since 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 operation seven runs well even 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.560
 with graphics not very powerful 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470
 now let's see the game minecraft 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.850
 as you will all know more'engras is a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.740
 Adventure construction game and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.790
 survival on freedom of 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.250
 action and the possibility of 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.960
 customize it with skins and not so modes 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.700
 this game of a life tires infinite 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.170
 in addition to single player modes 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.640
 minecraft also has a way 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.070
 for several players through 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.020
 online servers to play this mode 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.940
 You have two options or you join a 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.830
 game created by another user or 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.240
 the creation itself start your own 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.610
 games in minecraft requires that 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.590
 download a server program using 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.980

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.240

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.930
 graphics but as for playing you're going 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.300
