00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.400
 youtube of dual court can game the day of 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.420
 today we have the unboxing of the gigabyte 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.269
 gtx 770 version with overclock win force 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.849
 3 good this card or in our 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.579
 Video card promises us the solution 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.579
 Cooling up to 450 watts 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.910
 and how the wii force version works 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.770
 open the box that contains 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.470
 as almost always a box inside a 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.470
 box with the logo 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470
 gb 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 and the tie 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.390
 the card 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 small is that we can remove it and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.300
 Now let's find all the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.300
 actors 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.750
 because it may seem that this comes very 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.320
 all right 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 packed so if you plan to order it from 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.060
 outside the city 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.130
 or send them a shipment 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 do not worry, the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 good packaging and first 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.080
 the quick start guide your disk 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.860
 installation 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.580
 and its moles adapters for 8 pins 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.310
 and for 6 pins no adapter from 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.410
 bella of tvg but as we said 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.890
 many times if they plan to use a card 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.440
 video of this caliber so I recommend 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.240
 update a monitor with hdmi 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.270
 little bit 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.560
 and displayport inclusiveness because 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 so much envy 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.759
 Here is a video card PSV 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.160
 now he is driving it black and gb and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.930
 thanks to this good nowadays nowadays 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.560
 many people want to be 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.989
 video cards and kind of because 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.359
 they have already changed before and used 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.970
 a lot of plastic but now all that 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.160
 see the frame 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 practically aluminum as they can 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.130
 see three fans referred notes 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.460
 large size no reference gb 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.320
 usually does not handle models of 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.390
 reference as for example 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.570
 just as they handle reference models 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.090
 and they just change the heatsink both 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.400
 came and how those are from the few 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 brands that I even show you are going to say 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.420
 that maybe the message of the few 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.300
 brands that handle designs not of 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.640
 reference from the beginning when in the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.620
 entry panel came out third good 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.620
 let's find travel 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.220
 it still divides simple link 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 one day and double link hdmi output and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.480
 finally we have 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.480
 who wants to leave 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.470
 displayport outputs both the hdmi and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.340
 the display will already give us the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.840
 4k resolutions the should and not only 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.190
 we will be limited to 2560 x 1600 in 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.030
 top good will 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.430
 find 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.670
 which has an 8-pin connector 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.560
 for the 6- pin power source 1 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.630
 here we are going to see the two connectors for 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.660
 make sly this card is compatible with 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.069
 slide up three ways and below we go 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.140
 have the express pci 3.0 port that 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.770
 I repeat if you have not seen my other videos 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.950
 PC and 3.0 is also compatible with PC and 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.470
 2.0 and even with pc and 1.0 only 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.840
 than in cards of this range 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.640
 I recommend only psi 2.0 in 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.550
 forward they will not see much 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.970
 difference between the performance of 2.0 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.190
 the 3.0 to the best 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.850
 123 of the degree of performance but weigh 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.230
 in conclusion pc and 2.0 is still in 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.840
 the market 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.310
 let's see good the heatsink 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.850
 practically encompasses what is all 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.730
 the video card 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.400
 is a very large heatsink has a 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.040
 very low profile or if they want to put 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.580
 23 life cards inclusive of others 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.730
 marks the fans as you can see 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.240
 they are not going to hinder those I love the 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.970
 design that you are driving in these 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.970
 cards quite possibly in the next 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.300
 video card be gb one equal one 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.580
 win force I still do not know 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.479
 here I will update but well this 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.759
 it was the boxing of the gigabyte gtx 770 me 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.370
 Missed to tell you that it is the model of 2 GB 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.110
 There is also a 4 - gigabyte model 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.940
 It is for you to mount the same but with 4 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.190
 gigabytes of memory when you are out 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.190
 a boxing until next time
