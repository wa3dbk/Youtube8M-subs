 so purely interested in it 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.460
 better than the idea of fishing just for 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.040

 Our town has one brother too 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:52.889

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.070

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:52.230
 because there is something there is 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.320
