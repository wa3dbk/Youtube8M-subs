00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.050 

then<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> smaller<00:02:35.250> ones<00:02:35.520> always<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:36.000> you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
then the smaller ones always do you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.080 
then the smaller ones always do you
taste<00:02:36.240> better<00:02:36.510> than<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> bigger<00:02:36.990> ones

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
taste better than the bigger ones

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.370 
taste better than the bigger ones
fresher<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.270> meat

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.500 

but<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.950> won't<00:02:44.100> go

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.470 

great
