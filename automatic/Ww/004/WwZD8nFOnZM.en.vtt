00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.319
 yes but there 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.319
 sir francoeur 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 this card 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.919
 six and ten of the spades actually on the arrival of the first to speak 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.879
 history at the big blind and at franck 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.630
 and restart it 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 first talk five days to talk behind with six and eighteen countries that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.630
 but we are in the realm of the whimsical and the dangerous there anyway even if you 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.810
 have button 6 with two or three players who were well pinpoint the 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.670
 first place he loves charest chose to go very far we will see if 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.790
 richard richard kit difficult for him to pay alone because there is when 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.350
 even three players has nothing yet 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.710
 Martine re-raises these bodies and who can in addition fell on a beautiful 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.800
 major asse 3 or valley ladies who may be able to revive him 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.580
 and that's what was looking for a wide farmhouse before the flop and always with the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.910
 dojo to lorient what I find that I know 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.560
 as well the risk for the king to know the wearing of the poet's race in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 the enemy soul but also the risk of no longer touching anything and because the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.300
 player in front of the astaire afad to nothing if an assault 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.760
 So King indeed to make them pay before in general so he was able to raise 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.000
 it's correct 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.090
 now cédric there I'm not here on a year that was I think ridiculous 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.860
 to work with any small this novel I played very well from him 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.390
 found the ground will be fixed so cédric will of course pay what led 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 king jorio 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 12 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.690
 and 512 1500 in the pot they put three minamata that it's normal who pays 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.830
 everything is a pearl 6 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.470
 I think it's going to crash what's going to happen and it's the cat there is not 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 that the blow but he is not wrong his means can be a hundred probably 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.180
 know what received in front of Beijing 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.700
 paranagua there is better cc analysis that has at least a huge bluff bit 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.200
 likely that last year a moment with morality finances so natural has 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.990
 rejected the treaty that is far too big I go back launched the country and its 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.580
 secret accounts big love 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 with the 38 th 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.139
 to catch hurricanes 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.229
 but it's true that there can be country anxieties with his pair of jeans 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 so we're going to have trouble cashing in at 6-10 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.819
 he a priori badly barred 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.509
 the most remarkable still a little worse barred tomorrow 90% now 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.649
 There you go 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:31.299
 go so I think it's not uncommon to cross% and cocoa v3 in order to 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.329
 demonstrate the opposite
