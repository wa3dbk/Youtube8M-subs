anyway<00:04:21.810> I'm<00:04:22.020> Dreamweaver<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.830> basically

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
anyway I'm Dreamweaver is basically

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.690 
anyway I'm Dreamweaver is basically
it's<00:04:24.420> good<00:04:24.840> for<00:04:25.140> design<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.440> basically<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
it's good for design and basically the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.890 
it's good for design and basically the
the<00:04:27.690> field<00:04:29.120> standard<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.600> people<00:04:30.810> might

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
the field standard some people might

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.650 
the field standard some people might
argue<00:04:30.960> but<00:04:31.500> i<00:04:31.560> think<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:31.920> a<00:04:31.980> field<00:04:32.220> standard

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
argue but i think is a field standard

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.330 
argue but i think is a field standard
dreamweaver<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.840> has<00:04:34.470> tools<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.920> do<00:04:35.040> stuff<00:04:35.310> for

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
dreamweaver it has tools to do stuff for

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.700 
dreamweaver it has tools to do stuff for
you<00:04:35.580> but<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.270> should<00:04:36.300> learn<00:04:36.660> code<00:04:37.080> because

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
you but you should learn code because

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.930 
you but you should learn code because
what<00:04:37.890> if<00:04:37.980> something<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.550> where<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.790> want

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
what if something is that where you want

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
what if something is that where you want
it<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.690> won't<00:04:39.870> know<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.200> put<00:04:40.440> it

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
it you won't know where to put it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.250 
it you won't know where to put it
anything<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:41.580> i<00:04:41.910> suggest<00:04:42.750> starting<00:04:43.080> out<00:04:43.200> with
