00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.029

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.599
 Woman 6 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 Only I used two kids together because 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.590
 This movie is very thin. 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 I have another job here that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 It is a film I also love on a wire 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 any beginner does a beautiful job 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 because the thread values ​​the work a lot 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.059
 so come on, I've done it here. 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 I put 32 stitches on the needle and knit 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.090

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.660

 I cut you knitting with you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 it is easy and quick to do that I 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 I counted by 65 centimeters 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 he is 12 wide here but the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 important is for me to my size 65 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.850
