on this super ampere which if you don't
know<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.129> almost<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.910> vet<00:02:12.150> took<00:02:12.300> around

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.780 
so let's go ahead and give this one a
quick<00:02:21.750> try<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.410> let's<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.489> off<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
quick try right now let's get off the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.330 
quick try right now let's get off the
edge<00:02:23.970> come<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.510> oh<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.590> think<00:02:25.739> we<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.069> get<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.280> on

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
edge come on oh I think we can get it on

there we go nicely done and as you can
see<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.430> pretty

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
see right now this is going to be pretty

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.059 
see right now this is going to be pretty
damn<00:02:30.540> crazy<00:02:30.870> I'm<00:02:31.170> wondering<00:02:31.680> where<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
damn crazy I'm wondering where we can

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.289 
damn crazy I'm wondering where we can
actually<00:02:32.190> go<00:02:32.489> with<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.700> thing<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:32.970> how<00:02:33.060> far

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
actually go with this thing or how far

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.330 
actually go with this thing or how far
we<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.540> actually<00:02:33.629> go<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.860> ramp<00:02:35.129> is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we can actually go because this ramp is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.890 
we can actually go because this ramp is
supposed<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> biggest<00:02:36.360> ramps

mods actually look in GTA 5 now this is
a<00:03:20.940> bit<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.269> proportion<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> vehicle

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
a bit out of proportion of the vehicle

a bit out of proportion of the vehicle
size<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.680> an<00:03:22.799> actually<00:03:23.040> perfect<00:03:23.489> same<00:03:24.359> with

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.940 
video but I have seen other videos and
stuff<00:03:33.840> where<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.139> bus<00:03:34.319> spoil<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.829> and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
stuff where the bus spoil is on and

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.770 
stuff where the bus spoil is on and
stuff<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.400> that's<00:03:36.090> pretty<00:03:36.359> awesome

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
stuff so that's pretty awesome

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.330 
stuff so that's pretty awesome
I<00:03:36.870> believe<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.230> interior<00:03:37.769> as<00:03:37.889> well<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.190> this

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
I believe the interior as well on this

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.699 
I believe the interior as well on this
thing<00:03:38.639> as<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.599> can<00:03:39.750> see<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:39.959> now<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.380> lot<00:03:40.650> of

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
thing as you can see right now a lot of

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.680 
thing as you can see right now a lot of
it<00:03:40.799> buggy<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.489> hands<00:03:41.790> are<00:03:41.940> not<00:03:42.150> positioned<00:03:42.329> at

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
it buggy the hands are not positioned at

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.720 
it buggy the hands are not positioned at
all<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.169> steering<00:03:43.319> wheel<00:03:43.609> correctly<00:03:44.609> but

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
all on the steering wheel correctly but

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.309 
all on the steering wheel correctly but
it<00:03:44.790> does<00:03:44.940> actually<00:03:45.239> function<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> serum

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
it does actually function like a serum

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.930 
it does actually function like a serum
or<00:03:46.410> what<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.340> see<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.579> kind<00:03:47.819> of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
or what as you can see that kind of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.250 
or what as you can see that kind of
peeking<00:03:48.239> into<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.480> back<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.660> little<00:03:48.900> bit<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
peeking into the back a little bit and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.839 
peeking into the back a little bit and
interior<00:03:50.099> could<00:03:50.250> definitely<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.700> lot

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
interior could definitely be a lot

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.909 
interior could definitely be a lot
better<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.690> general<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.410> definitely

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
better but in general it's definitely

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.740 
better but in general it's definitely
awesome<00:03:53.069> considering<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.510> down

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
awesome considering we have this down

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.099 
awesome considering we have this down
vehicle<00:03:55.139> in<00:03:55.349> GTA<00:03:56.010> 5<00:03:56.310> now<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.870> going<00:03:58.049> to

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
vehicle in GTA 5 now it's going to

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.030 
vehicle in GTA 5 now it's going to
change<00:03:58.260> your<00:03:58.349> color<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.680> real<00:03:58.859> quick

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
again that's what colors we can actually

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.940 
again that's what colors we can actually
have<00:04:00.690> once<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.169> we're<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.739> gonna<00:04:01.829> go

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
have once again we're just gonna go

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.740 
have once again we're just gonna go
ahead<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.400> call<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.030> scroll<00:04:03.419> through<00:04:03.660> them

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
ahead and call it a scroll through them

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.080 
ahead and call it a scroll through them
quickly<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.440> intersect<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.430> random<00:04:05.760> one<00:04:05.880> for

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
quickly and intersect a random one for

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.699 
quickly and intersect a random one for
now<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.389> then<00:04:06.599> we'll<00:04:06.750> take<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.079> back<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
now and then we'll take it back to the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.559 
now and then we'll take it back to the

super course as well or no super course
the<00:04:09.750> super<00:04:10.079> ramp<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:11.370> will<00:04:11.519> give<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.700> a

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
the super ramp and that will give it a

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.930 
the super ramp and that will give it a
go<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:12.269> as<00:04:12.419> well<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:13.099> think<00:04:14.099> I<00:04:14.250> can<00:04:14.549> apply

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
go on there as well I think I can apply

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.490 
go on there as well I think I can apply
um<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:17.450> multi<00:04:18.450> color<00:04:18.630> combination<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.289> think

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
um a multi color combination to think

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.050 
um a multi color combination to think
like<00:04:19.919> multi<00:04:20.220> colors<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.639> stuff<00:04:20.789> I<00:04:20.849> don't<00:04:20.880> if

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
like multi colors and stuff I don't if

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.069 
like multi colors and stuff I don't if
you<00:04:21.120> guys<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.359> ever<00:04:21.450> seen<00:04:21.539> those<00:04:21.750> multi

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
you guys have ever seen those multi

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.200 
you guys have ever seen those multi
colors<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.440> GTA<00:04:22.740> 5<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.909> can<00:04:24.030> apply

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
colors in GTA 5 I think you can apply

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.880 
colors in GTA 5 I think you can apply
them<00:04:24.510> using<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.200> well<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.409> we're<00:04:25.800> going

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
them using this as well so we're going

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.870 
them using this as well so we're going
to<00:04:25.950> go<00:04:26.039> ahead<00:04:26.130> once<00:04:26.430> again<00:04:26.640> just<00:04:26.760> keep

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
to go ahead once again just keep

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.500 
to go ahead once again just keep
randomizing

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
randomizing

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.330 
randomizing
now<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.930> actually<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> white<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:29.040> this<00:04:29.130> car

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
now I actually like a white on this car

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.130 
now I actually like a white on this car
not<00:04:29.490> too<00:04:29.640> sure<00:04:29.760> why<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.600> prefer<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.080> when

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
not too sure why but I prefer it when

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.400 
not too sure why but I prefer it when
it's<00:04:31.290> just<00:04:31.320> white<00:04:31.670> there<00:04:32.670> we<00:04:32.760> go<00:04:32.910> ah<00:04:33.090> oh<00:04:33.690> there

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
it's just white there we go ah oh there

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.330 
it's just white there we go ah oh there
we<00:04:34.470> go<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:34.890> actually<00:04:35.220> probably

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
we go so we can actually probably

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.470 
we go so we can actually probably
spoiler<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.030> thing<00:04:36.210> which<00:04:36.330> is
