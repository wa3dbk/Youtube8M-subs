have an answer

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.170 
have an answer
and<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.980> answer<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.400> they're<00:04:10.580> working<00:04:10.760> on<00:04:11.000> it

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
and the answer is they're working on it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.729 
and the answer is they're working on it
and<00:04:11.330> they've<00:04:11.750> been<00:04:11.900> saying<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.230> for<00:04:12.410> several

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
and they've been saying that for several

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.290 
and they've been saying that for several
years<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.310> we're<00:04:13.459> really<00:04:13.610> working<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.120> find

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
years so we're really working to find

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.790 
years so we're really working to find
out<00:04:14.420> when<00:04:14.630> are<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:14.810> going<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.080> get<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.410> answer

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
out when are we going to get that answer

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.280 
out when are we going to get that answer
and<00:04:16.310> my<00:04:16.669> concern<00:04:17.060> is<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.450> that<00:04:17.480> we're<00:04:18.049> running

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and my concern is is that we're running

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.879 
and my concern is is that we're running
out<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.410> time

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
out of time

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.009 
out of time
2020<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:19.669> coming<00:04:19.940> there's<00:04:20.389> a<00:04:20.450> lot<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.870> aircraft

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
2020 is coming there's a lot of aircraft

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.240 
2020 is coming there's a lot of aircraft
in<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.440> fleet<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.650> need<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:21.980> be<00:04:22.010> upgraded

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
in the fleet that need to be upgraded

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.879 
in the fleet that need to be upgraded
mine<00:04:23.030> included<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:24.260> don't<00:04:24.440> know<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> cost

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
mine included and I don't know the cost

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.590 
mine included and I don't know the cost
and<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.190> don't<00:04:25.250> know<00:04:25.520> what's<00:04:25.760> involved<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.300> I'm

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and I don't know what's involved so I'm

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.060 
and I don't know what's involved so I'm
concerned<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.139> couple<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.500> fronts<00:04:27.620> one<00:04:27.980> I'm

concerned on a couple of fronts one I'm
hearing<00:04:28.340> some<00:04:28.520> pretty<00:04:28.700> significant<00:04:29.600> costs

there's a lot of hurdles in terms of

provider<00:04:56.440> that's<00:04:57.440> not<00:04:57.620> just<00:04:57.860> how<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.100> push<00:04:59.060> a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
provider that's not just how I push a

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.850 
provider that's not just how I push a
button<00:04:59.360> that's<00:04:59.840> actually<00:05:00.169> how<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.350> get<00:05:00.530> my

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
button that's actually how I get my

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.190 
button that's actually how I get my
information<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.750> person<00:05:03.110> that's

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
information to the person that's

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.860 
information to the person that's
controlling<00:05:03.650> me<00:05:03.889> and<00:05:04.070> that's<00:05:04.479> those<00:05:05.479> things<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
controlling me and that's those things I

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.420 
controlling me and that's those things I
think<00:05:05.930> are<00:05:06.200> not<00:05:06.320> thought<00:05:06.740> too<00:05:07.010> much<00:05:07.190> in<00:05:07.370> a

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
think are not thought too much in a

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.280 
think are not thought too much in a
training<00:05:07.669> event<00:05:07.850> but<00:05:08.240> as<00:05:08.360> an<00:05:08.570> instructor<00:05:09.139> I

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
training event but as an instructor I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.530 
training event but as an instructor I
think<00:05:09.560> that's<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.800> big<00:05:09.979> deal<00:05:10.130> there's<00:05:10.580> there's

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
think that's a big deal there's there's

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.390 
think that's a big deal there's there's
a<00:05:11.600> lot<00:05:11.750> more<00:05:11.930> than<00:05:12.229> just<00:05:12.410> saying<00:05:12.620> hey<00:05:13.100> I'd<00:05:13.190> like

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
a lot more than just saying hey I'd like

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.540 
a lot more than just saying hey I'd like
flight<00:05:13.940> level<00:05:14.150> two<00:05:14.270> five<00:05:14.450> zero<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:15.289> be<00:05:15.550> text

flight level two five zero to be text

the<00:05:19.070> way<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.310> think<00:05:19.640> about<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.539> very

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
the way to think about that is is very

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.510 
the way to think about that is is very
different<00:05:21.110> than<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.710> think<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.100> lot<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:22.250> people

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
different than I think a lot of people

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.460 
different than I think a lot of people
have<00:05:22.669> considered<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.630> implementation<00:05:24.380> of

have considered the implementation of
next-gen<00:05:24.800> technology<00:05:25.490> will<00:05:25.729> involve<00:05:26.060> further

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
next-gen technology will involve further

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.630 
next-gen technology will involve further

clarification in terms of certification

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.490 
clarification in terms of certification
requirements<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:29.780> lot<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.050> work<00:05:30.229> on<00:05:30.350> the

operators<00:05:32.930> will<00:05:33.080> also<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.650> carefully

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
operators will also have to carefully

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.219 
operators will also have to carefully

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
issue at the maintenance shops could be

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.969 
issue at the maintenance shops could be
a<00:06:04.460> problem<00:06:05.090> for<00:06:05.660> a<00:06:06.020> lot<00:06:06.380> of<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.650> smaller

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
a problem for a lot of the smaller

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.100 
a problem for a lot of the smaller
aircraft<00:06:07.330> but<00:06:08.330> in<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.539> business<00:06:08.870> jet<00:06:09.080> market

2020 mandate the problem for older

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.059 
2020 mandate the problem for older
aircraft<00:06:19.729> is<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.840> operators<00:06:21.800> are<00:06:21.889> going

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
aircraft is that the operators are going

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.820 
aircraft is that the operators are going
to<00:06:22.129> have<00:06:22.280> to<00:06:22.400> decide<00:06:22.810> is<00:06:23.810> it<00:06:23.930> worth<00:06:24.169> upgrading

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
to have to decide is it worth upgrading

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.290 
to have to decide is it worth upgrading
my<00:06:25.460> airplane<00:06:25.849> for<00:06:26.270> ATSB<00:06:26.889> or<00:06:28.180> should<00:06:29.180> I<00:06:29.270> just

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
my airplane for ATSB or should I just

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.330 
my airplane for ATSB or should I just
sell<00:06:29.810> it<00:06:29.840> and<00:06:30.020> buy<00:06:30.319> a<00:06:30.349> newer<00:06:30.620> airplane<00:06:31.129> that's

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
sell it and buy a newer airplane that's

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.909 
sell it and buy a newer airplane that's
already<00:06:31.639> equipped<00:06:32.030> or<00:06:32.960> that<00:06:33.409> has<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.650> lower

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
already equipped or that has a lower

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.240 
already equipped or that has a lower
cost<00:06:34.340> way<00:06:35.180> of<00:06:35.210> meeting<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.259> mandate<00:06:36.740> what<00:06:37.219> I

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
cost way of meeting the mandate what I

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.700 
cost way of meeting the mandate what I
think<00:06:37.580> we'll<00:06:37.789> see<00:06:38.030> is<00:06:38.270> that<00:06:38.560> operators<00:06:39.560> are

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
think we'll see is that operators are

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.159 
think we'll see is that operators are
going<00:06:39.830> to<00:06:39.889> face<00:06:40.099> that<00:06:40.340> decision<00:06:40.909> and<00:06:41.750> some<00:06:42.080> of

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
going to face that decision and some of

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.290 
going to face that decision and some of
them<00:06:42.289> will<00:06:42.439> decide<00:06:42.860> to<00:06:43.129> equip<00:06:43.520> in<00:06:43.819> order<00:06:44.150> to

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
them will decide to equip in order to

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.089 
them will decide to equip in order to
preserve<00:06:44.659> the<00:06:45.020> value<00:06:45.439> of<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.680> aircraft

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
preserve the value of the aircraft

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.760 
preserve the value of the aircraft
because<00:06:46.789> if<00:06:46.969> they<00:06:47.090> don't<00:06:47.349> they<00:06:48.349> aren't<00:06:48.680> going

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
because if they don't they aren't going

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.640
