we<00:00:06.090> have<00:00:06.270> an<00:00:06.420> array<00:00:06.630> of<00:00:06.660> coffee<00:00:07.110> makers<00:00:07.590> here

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
we have an array of coffee makers here

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.770 
we have an array of coffee makers here
at<00:00:08.040> cratenbarrel<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.600> coffee

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
at cratenbarrel and one of the coffee

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.530 
at cratenbarrel and one of the coffee
makers<00:00:10.380> like<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:11.280> percolator<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> most

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
makers like a percolator is the most

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.000 
makers like a percolator is the most
amount<00:00:12.810> spoon<00:00:14.540> so<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> way<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.290> mocha<00:00:16.590> master

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
amount spoon so the way the mocha master

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.940 
amount spoon so the way the mocha master
work<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.029> copper<00:00:18.480> key<00:00:18.810> element<00:00:19.560> works

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
work is the copper key element works

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.400 
work is the copper key element works
like<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> circulator<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.720> heats<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> water

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
like a circulator it heats up the water

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
like a circulator it heats up the water
to<00:00:22.949> 200<00:00:23.610> Fahrenheit

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to 200 Fahrenheit

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080 
to 200 Fahrenheit
and<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> does<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.460> pushes<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.060> water

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and what it does is it pushes the water

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.800 
and what it does is it pushes the water
up<00:00:27.680> into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.920> spigot<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> picot<00:00:30.420> here

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
up into the spigot and this picot here

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.069 
up into the spigot and this picot here
has<00:00:31.109> nine<00:00:31.529> holes<00:00:32.030> to<00:00:33.030> go<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.199> point<00:00:34.949> four

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
has nine holes to go into a point four

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.150 
has nine holes to go into a point four
filter<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.430> five<00:00:39.180> scoops<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:40.800> coffee

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
filter and I have five scoops of coffee

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.200 
filter and I have five scoops of coffee
into<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.260> filter<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.850> as<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.149> see

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
into the filter here and as you can see

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
into the filter here and as you can see
is<00:00:45.719> starting<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.290> percolate<00:00:47.930> copper<00:00:48.930> heating

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is starting to percolate copper heating

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.150 
is starting to percolate copper heating
element<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.370> pushing<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> water<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.920> there<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
element is pushing the water up there is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
element is pushing the water up there is
no<00:00:53.370> water<00:00:53.730> pump<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.660> machine

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
no water pump in this machine

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.389 
no water pump in this machine
so<00:00:56.640> once<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:58.079> mocha<00:00:58.350> master<00:00:58.800> starts<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
so once the mocha master starts to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
so once the mocha master starts to
percolate<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.570> 200<00:01:00.989> degrees<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
percolate at 200 degrees it will put the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
percolate at 200 degrees it will put the
water<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> reservoir<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:04.500> the

it works on a five ounce cup of coffee
this<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:20.039> is<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.250> four<00:01:20.729> ounce<00:01:20.899> glass<00:01:21.899> okay<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
this here is a four ounce glass okay so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.109 
this here is a four ounce glass okay so
now<00:01:23.039> I'm<00:01:23.160> gonna<00:01:23.250> remove<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> lid<00:01:23.819> because<00:01:24.030> I

white button there that allows you to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.020 
white button there that allows you to
actually<00:02:00.659> pour<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.080> cup<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.440> coffee<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
actually pour a cup of coffee and it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.749 
actually pour a cup of coffee and it
stops<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.900> brew<00:02:04.110> process<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> water<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
stops the brew process but the water is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.199 
stops the brew process but the water is
still<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> filter<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:08.700> machine

fast it goes into the spigot and now

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.509 
fast it goes into the spigot and now
it's<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.730> corral<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.160> want<00:02:29.400> a
