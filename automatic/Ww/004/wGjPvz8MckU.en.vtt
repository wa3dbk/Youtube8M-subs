to<00:01:17.509> Experian<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.349> spent<00:01:18.679> all<00:01:18.859> morning

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
to Experian I spent all morning

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.370 
to Experian I spent all morning
trying<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:19.880> find<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.359> of<00:01:20.389> those<00:01:20.569> sickly<00:01:21.079> green

trying to find one of those sickly green

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.370 
trying to find one of those sickly green
transmitters<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.399> had<00:01:22.549> gone<00:01:22.729> bad<00:01:22.999> yeah<00:01:23.539> that

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
transmitters that had gone bad yeah that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.589 
transmitters that had gone bad yeah that
can<00:01:24.590> waste<00:01:24.859> an<00:01:25.099> entire<00:01:25.459> day<00:01:25.819> you<00:01:26.119> are<00:01:26.209> about<00:01:26.450> to

I<00:01:38.450> couldn't<00:01:38.899> agree<00:01:39.079> more<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.709> batteries<00:01:40.189> on

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
I couldn't agree more the batteries on

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.949 
I couldn't agree more the batteries on
my<00:01:40.490> walkie<00:01:40.729> are<00:01:40.969> shot<00:01:41.270> because<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.630> all<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
my walkie are shot because of all the

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.989 
my walkie are shot because of all the
time<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.229> spent<00:01:42.679> talking<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.249> control<00:01:43.609> room

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
time I spent talking to the control room

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.120 
time I spent talking to the control room
yes<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.599> hard<00:01:44.779> to<00:01:44.929> work<00:01:45.139> with<00:01:45.349> transmitters

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
yes it's hard to work with transmitters

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.699 
yes it's hard to work with transmitters
that<00:01:46.159> aren't<00:01:46.639> technically<00:01:47.149> evolved<00:01:47.929> but<00:01:48.469> with

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
that aren't technically evolved but with

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.819 
that aren't technically evolved but with
smart<00:01:49.189> line<00:01:49.459> all<00:01:50.029> I<00:01:50.090> need<00:01:50.749> to<00:01:50.929> do<00:01:51.109> is<00:01:51.289> say<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
smart line all I need to do is say the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.099 
smart line all I need to do is say the
word<00:01:51.859> and<00:01:52.609> these<00:01:52.789> guys<00:01:53.119> know<00:01:53.149> right<00:01:53.869> where<00:01:54.079> to

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
word and these guys know right where to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.800 
word and these guys know right where to
go<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:54.649> what<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.399> do<00:01:55.579> right<00:01:55.969> it's<00:01:56.509> called

go and what to do right it's called

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.559 
go and what to do right it's called
integration<00:01:57.590> with<00:01:57.739> Experian<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:58.969> let's<00:01:59.389> get

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
integration with Experian so let's get

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.049 
integration with Experian so let's get
to<00:01:59.779> it<00:01:59.809> gentlemen<00:02:00.109> lookie<00:02:01.099> here<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.909> the
