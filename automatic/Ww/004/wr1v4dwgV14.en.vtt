00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
the shots that we've had shocks flow out

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.090 
the shots that we've had shocks flow out
on<00:01:49.070> us<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.610> had<00:01:49.850> problems<00:01:50.299> with<00:01:50.840> other<00:01:51.100> other

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
on us and had problems with other other

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.490 
on us and had problems with other other
brands<00:01:52.520> and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
brands and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.590 
brands and
this<00:01:55.040> shot<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.520> very<00:01:55.730> durable<00:01:55.940> shock<00:01:56.390> but

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
this shot with a very durable shock but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.270 
this shot with a very durable shock but
I<00:01:56.630> think

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
I think

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.880 
I think
work<00:01:58.580> well<00:01:58.820> for<00:01:59.090> what<00:01:59.210> we're<00:01:59.390> doing<00:01:59.890> biggest

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
work well for what we're doing biggest

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.310 
work well for what we're doing biggest
advantage<00:02:01.400> I<00:02:01.820> see<00:02:02.000> with<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.630> triple

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
advantage I see with the triple

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.930 
advantage I see with the triple
adjustable<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.100> number<00:02:04.520> one<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.700> got<00:02:04.910> a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
adjustable is number one you got a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.139 
adjustable is number one you got a
remote<00:02:05.240> reservoir<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.230> now<00:02:06.670> shots<00:02:07.670> won't<00:02:07.880> heat

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
remote reservoir so now shots won't heat

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.560 
remote reservoir so now shots won't heat
up<00:02:08.179> not<00:02:09.170> across<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.100> cooling<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.610> important

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
up not across the cooling is important

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.100 
up not across the cooling is important
then<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.470> triple<00:02:12.740> adjustable<00:02:13.340> has<00:02:14.110> your

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
then the triple adjustable has your

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.530 
then the triple adjustable has your
regular<00:02:15.560> bump<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.340> rebound<00:02:16.459> adjustments<00:02:17.360> but

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
regular bump and rebound adjustments but

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.360 
regular bump and rebound adjustments but
they<00:02:17.630> also<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> high<00:02:18.380> speed<00:02:18.709> adjustment

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
they also have a high speed adjustment

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.650 
they also have a high speed adjustment
