00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.410
 how to diagnose a failure of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.000
 injectors 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.440
 than what one can notice when the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.030
 injector is not working well one 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.430
 may notice irregular operation of the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.469
 vehicle generally when engine is 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.750
 of the minimum one never seen few 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.880
 messages and regular if it moves vibrates 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.529
 normal hand then it could be that the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.890
 injectors are built and sometimes 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.510
 you also have to do this process of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.849
 Mechanical cleaning as treatment 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.369
 preventive there are many brands of 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.800
 vehicles that recommend that each 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.339
 certain amount let's say the liter of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.500
 gasoline is supplied or mixed 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.440
 with gasoline a cleaning product 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 injectors film a typical agent 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 Detergent 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.080
 of elements of solvent character and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 cleaning agents that are supplied 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.930
 to the gasoline tank 40 creation to full or 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.310
 when it's going to be full it's placed 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.500
 that that fluid and it is rolled from the vehicle 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.280
 There are some brands that you can recommend 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 these channels in thousand kilometers to 5000 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.160
 It is always advisable to go to the manual and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.350
 go a bit let's say 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.260
 the representative supplier of the brand 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.370
 but in general it is a measure that in the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.640
 Most of the part of the recommended 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.340
 and preventive measures that avoid 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.610
 let's say that readers can accumulate 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 polluting agents in the form 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.400
 early 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.050
 the other element of course what already 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.690
 we have spoken in other programs 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.390
 asthma fear all filters all 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.550
 gasoline filter systems do not 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 only the filter brings injector in the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.820
 filter that goes in the system 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.920
 fuel that beats the mouth all that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.740
 filter you have to make your change and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.170
 cleaning as indicated in the manual 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.720
 the other element that is important in the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 cleaning the gas tank because 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.950
 any contaminating element or agent 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.799
 that is inside the tank that I achieve 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.829
 pass through the mouth will reach the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.979
 injector because once the fluid 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.799
 that the gas goes out the pump goes 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.610
 literally by a tube to the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.519
 injector if there is any element of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.470
 dirt to water or any vote too 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.019
 that's going to go to the director if it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.360
 short lies of solid character and that 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.400
 can reach and obstruct plugging the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.049
 injector 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.280
 in such a way that that is extremely 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.550
 important 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.170
 of the rest are elements that do not require 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.360
 a maintenance 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.720
 particular beyond those beautiful 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 preventive and good cleaning let's say 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.010
 mechanics by ultrasound depending on 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 what the manufacturer of the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 vehicle
