00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.510
 new guide world of warcraft wow too 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 frame Today it's all about the success of the master 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.730
 Relics and more precisely in the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.290
 section Rebirth of a christ 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 For this we want once again a quest 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.509
 by harrison jones and that is today 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 despite contract of the designers gates 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.200
 and yes we go in the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.340
 present or part of 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.489
 Chateau Monday 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.250
 and we fly to the kita 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.420
 Custom and then walk south because there 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 we have lost a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 designer find the cities is located 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.280
 are in front of me is missing 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.429
 even dead one says that and at 67 21 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.350
 for example and if you found it 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.629
 get so new quests specifically with them 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.629
 because reading a book that is next door 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.069
 him on the ground 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.979
 we can record that here and so 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.900
 Japan has instructions in the book where 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 but the things have disappeared 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.060
 Of course we can do it a bit 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 search for it 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 and yes there is a small kart wii 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 have to look for small opponents and you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.480
 See you soon so they never 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 again and I am really just now 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.970
 run the cave into it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.150
 So I'll show you again was 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.030
 The cave is laterally and meters from the cave 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.130
 origin point and that is the entrance 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.610
 at the level of coordinates 68 22 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.310
 and yes we have to defeat that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.620
 Lohnstein is almost the enemy and the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.040
 should drop a crystal later 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.860
 So we start the fight 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 has a little more live the normal 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:07.160
 opponents though 500 k so I think feasible 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.160
 be like this 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 now the enemy is defeated and we 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.310
 have the splitter get a new one 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.040
 quest with the next note and there 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.080
 there is another small card there 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.269
 I do not show the whole trip now 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.690
 want and the guide just so short 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.790
 want to hold as possible so to the same 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.360
 so there we are again and standing 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.090
 a stone hut as well as in white 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.670
 rhinstÃ¤dter are the quest and there is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:56.799
 the new adversary at vox sports zone 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.940
 is called and at 27 72 32 so and yes there 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.790
 we have to defeat again 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.200
 clearly the one about the jump 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.519
 crystal later to get that too 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.250
 live a little bit more again 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:17.230
 I now have a few good cool down 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:19.389
 it works a bit faster so well 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.269
 finish circle and start a new quest 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.280
 accept and yes there is also one 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.079
 small suitcase first I want to say one 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.239
 then I have to go up to the mountain 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.650
 Although a bit on almost something is 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.410
 the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.060
 you'll see each other again like that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.549
 Individual stand at point 75 25 and up 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.579
 the map I'm here now supreme 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.419
 I look from here right down to 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.160
 Measure here to climb up the path and 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.599
 yes then just because it is more of a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.720
 a bit to the right then keep the mountain 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.290
 up and there is new again 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.599
 opponent with the smooth crystal sliver 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.019
 in the inventory then and we have to 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.019
 defeat again 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.810
 He also has a small servant 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.810
 but also relatively fast 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.590
 then we just know how to lay it fast 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.220
 partly you can also the authorities 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.080
 section of each of the respective 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.750
 also a bit with a success 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.140
 Of course, delle connect only if 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.470
 you who have the report or even the 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.450
 Taliban is active but now we have 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.350
 the rats have set the course 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.220
 christoph splitter and chris finish 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:58.340
 there we have to find a machine like that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.640
 which is gravel Monday in there will 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.680
 I do not have to make a card anymore 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:09.530
 We just go and we have to 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.820
 down here so a woman watching that 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.710
 Do not point it to a point below 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.060
 blows up where I can die becomes so 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.440
 that's just when I'm two now 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.440
 jumped world naturally death so danhel 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:36.120
 and but something else said exactly 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.900
 where is that right down there who is 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.410
 Actually, if I am a little bit now 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.850
 jumped down 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.550
 So I'm on the map now 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:53.880
 cave entrance at about 32 and that in the 44 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.310
 shadow monday and the cars we need 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.020
 they go into different ones 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.610
 As you can see I have the machine now 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:05.759
 found must do the splitter 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:09.800
 and then there is a little puzzle and 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:12.389
 Although there are symbols on the white ring 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 and remember we have to speak so to speak 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.960
 then turn 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.210
 she is currently another player 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.190
 who somehow helps me there I know 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.039
 Part not see if that works 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.020
 if another player is also three 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:31.110
 if I'm trying it right now 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:36.270
 he just wrote me if I am 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:38.760
 will the end itself so must 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.530
 just the same symbols always in 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.380
 hold the same series and then 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:51.750
 does it work that way and yes then 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:55.440
 we have to use the crystal like that and 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.970
 then what is actually of this 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.909
 section I have now even one 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:05.880
 bit confused with this online 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:07.909
 player but that's just this 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.139
 bring in symbols in the same and 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:13.409
 then you have the quest 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.389
 Everything should be fine 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.940
 only have to work in the 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.620
 go in garrison and yes you have 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.870
 her section like the birth of one 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.070
 Kristal managed 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.960
 yes that was it for this one 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.860
 guide i hope it helped you and 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.860
 wish you much fun
