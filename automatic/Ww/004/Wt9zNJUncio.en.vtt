00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
money off these videos i think i made

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.620 
money off these videos i think i made
like<00:02:45.860> i<00:02:45.980> said<00:02:46.160> my<00:02:46.280> last<00:02:46.430> video<00:02:46.730> like<00:02:46.880> 26<00:02:47.360> cents

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
like i said my last video like 26 cents

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.490 
like i said my last video like 26 cents
last<00:02:47.840> month<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:49.190> i<00:02:49.220> can't<00:02:49.520> do<00:02:49.670> giveaways<00:02:50.060> or

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
last month so i can't do giveaways or

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.630 
last month so i can't do giveaways or
xbox<00:02:51.500> live<00:02:51.710> gold<00:02:51.890> cards<00:02:52.280> or<00:02:52.370> anything<00:02:52.430> like

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
xbox live gold cards or anything like

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.030 
xbox live gold cards or anything like
that<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:54.050> figured<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.500> would<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that so I figured I would just use the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.650 
that so I figured I would just use the
sub-base<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.880> which<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.390> know<00:02:56.510> isn't

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
sub-base that I have which I know isn't

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.230 
sub-base that I have which I know isn't
very<00:02:56.870> large<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.710> loyal<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
very large but it's really loyal just to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.090 
very large but it's really loyal just to
upload<00:02:59.600> some<00:02:59.930> videos<00:02:59.960> from<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.530> guys<00:03:00.680> and
