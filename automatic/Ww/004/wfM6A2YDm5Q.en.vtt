00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
next few days and one thing I forgot to

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.610 
next few days and one thing I forgot to
mention<00:05:14.940> in<00:05:15.300> part<00:05:15.569> one<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.590> reason

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
mention in part one is that the reason

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.770 
mention in part one is that the reason
there<00:05:17.099> are<00:05:17.220> no<00:05:17.250> college<00:05:17.789> teams<00:05:18.120> included<00:05:18.659> in

there are no college teams included in

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.540 
there are no college teams included in
these<00:05:18.870> breakdowns<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.830> because<00:05:20.190> College

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
these breakdowns is because College

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.189 
these breakdowns is because College
Princeton<00:05:21.120> is<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.810> completely

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
Princeton is really a completely

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.350 
Princeton is really a completely
different<00:05:22.560> animal<00:05:22.919> than<00:05:23.069> Pro<00:05:23.520> Princeton<00:05:24.060> you

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
different animal than Pro Princeton you

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.820 
different animal than Pro Princeton you
have<00:05:24.449> 11<00:05:24.840> more<00:05:24.960> seconds<00:05:25.379> on<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.590> shot<00:05:25.620> clock

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
have 11 more seconds on the shot clock

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.800 
have 11 more seconds on the shot clock
and<00:05:26.340> that's<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.759> collegiate<00:05:27.180> level<00:05:27.360> that

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
and that's the collegiate level that

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.659 
and that's the collegiate level that
just<00:05:28.020> run<00:05:28.169> it<00:05:28.289> differently<00:05:28.650> than<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.069> pros<00:05:29.370> so

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669
