and then I fall short so I had a really

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410

the<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:43.230> game<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> pretty<00:00:45.480> much

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the top of my game and so I pretty much

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.700 
the top of my game and so I pretty much
knew<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> finish<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.620> top

finish<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> top<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
finish in the top two but you know and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
finish in the top two but you know and
something<00:00:52.620> went<00:00:52.829> terribly<00:00:52.920> wrong<00:00:53.309> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
something went terribly wrong it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
something went terribly wrong it's
possible<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.539> could<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.780> finished<00:00:54.899> third<00:00:55.260> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
possible I could have finished third but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
possible I could have finished third but
it<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.300> played<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.660> good
