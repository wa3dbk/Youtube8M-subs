00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.990
 realize when you see how to paint some 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.140
 need as are the extensions that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.680
 We'll paint 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.020
 and the brush a boot 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.850
 and in this case I'm going to use three tones 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.989

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.989

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.080

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.690
 I can not leave the cameras all the time 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.320
 when it ends the same where the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.510
 procedure that we have we are going to do 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.580

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.580

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.580
 point I'm going to paint them of evolution 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.490
 with the joints as stronger 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.950
 combining and attaching the joints I do not know 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.879

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.709
 which is hot kÃ¶rting and at the tip of the hot 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.530
 hot pin I put this dye that is tap 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.560
 of mingo good to see if it is because if not 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.690
 it gives me a lot of current and well I'm going to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.860
 wait 40 minutes after we passed the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.840
 dryer to grip with more 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.030
 intensity then we wash and in the end 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.420
 show them the result of how 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.420
