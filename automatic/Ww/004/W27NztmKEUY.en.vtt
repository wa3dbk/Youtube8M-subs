kilometers only on them worked 4,000

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.459 
kilometers only on them worked 4,000
miles<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.579> already<00:00:59.910> replaced<00:01:00.360> this<00:01:00.629> front

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
miles and I already replaced this front

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.540 
miles and I already replaced this front
right<00:01:02.430> tire<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> had<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:05.430> was

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
right tire because it had that there was

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.300 
right tire because it had that there was
a<00:01:05.580> separation<00:01:06.149> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
a separation of the right here so I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
a separation of the right here so I
think<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.030> sidewall<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.899> too<00:01:13.770> weak<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
think the the sidewall is too weak on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.690 
think the the sidewall is too weak on
these<00:01:14.280> tires

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.510 
to the US but again Canadian dollar now
is<00:03:45.860> very<00:03:46.040> weak<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.060> one<00:03:47.569> u.s.<00:03:47.930> dollar<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.520> 1.26

good<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:55.280> US<00:03:55.730> funds<00:03:56.060> but<00:03:56.360> then<00:03:56.540> when<00:03:56.720> you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
good in US funds but then when you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.540
