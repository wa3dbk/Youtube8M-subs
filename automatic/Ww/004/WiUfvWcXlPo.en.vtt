00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 And then, good people, I'll show you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 you today the third episode of my 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.700
 career as a player I am 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.539
 midfielder of curitiba 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.720
 I did 19 years in the game my value and there it is 725 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.570
 thousand is andré 500 I have gone up my price already 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.180
 But I'm still on loan to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 board put me to be loaned 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.349
 No one came for the time being. 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.189
 interested or even wanted to lend me more 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 okay 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.399
 the first match against the Saints and not 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 was either listed on the reservation bank 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.250
 I stayed 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 we lost 2 to 1 to my surprise 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 I was related to the game against 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 corinthians 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 hence the goals just to remind us 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 have to take the average 6 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.120
 Yes, I wanted to google and make plays. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 kicking index to 7 65% and creating more 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 30-goal chance 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 You pass and crosses everything 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 together and there the match against 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.440
 corinthians, I'm good for you there 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.449
 deep down you already know the result 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.199
 of the match because the game against the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 corinthians 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 It's necessary to say a lot and I played 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.090
 very bad people I'm stumbling around here 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 own players and so bad that I am 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 of the time is unfortunate that part was not 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 very good and I'm not running after the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 the ball because the team does not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.180
 does this in the cpu does not this pressure the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.040
 only kind of pressure they make 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 shadow and only surround players 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 but do not go back to get the ball 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.750
 and steal the ball in the kick kick but the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
 if he defended and made some moves 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.409
 some releases but unfortunately this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 there was nothing that the defense of the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.979
 Corinthians already took and we went 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.740
 first time in 0 to 0 there the second 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.689
 the result of this game without knowing the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.880
 Corinthians game right 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.979
 I need to say a lot and I'll have to go there. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.930
 I will know this piece of video galera 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 Why did I run after the ball? 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 the team does not do anything at all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.570
 stay there, I call, they do not have 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.259
 a little button that you press for the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.000
 staff make pressure push more 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.500
 they do little too and when they 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.049
 they are stupid 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.520
 then they open a lot of space and opens the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.239
 Our defense is to attack the team. 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.099
 adversary 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.650
 at the end of the game there and I even had cameras 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.170
 so much 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 behind the ball made so neat and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.250
 we finished in 0 to 0 I took 6 people 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.519
 well in the wake of what they ask me to 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 take the next match against the win 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.069
 here in my son is still savior I 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.319
 I did not understand 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.599
 I had already updated fifa before 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.609
 start your career and went to savior 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.900
 I may not put the right option there but 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.519
 okay is against victory yet 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.239
 It was not related to people tied for 2 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.400
 to 2 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.400
 fulfills two of the four objectives in 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.439
 in those four rounds which is bad 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.019
 half is not very good in the middle points 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.480
 well as the next objectives in the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.780
 The next four games are the ones that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.370
 you notice they decreased the number of 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.470
 goals now only three 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 before it was four then I 'm playing 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.389
 It's so bad I can not reach the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.879
 goals that they did the most 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.980
 easy to see if I can win some 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.760
 only in this way is it only 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.560
 way 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.129
 I was related to play against 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.959
 criciúma we are going to play outside the house and 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.010
 follow this game because there is a good thing 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.290
 coming here 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.769
 I will not say much but it was a 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.470
 match that will be marked there in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.260
 in this series in his career as a player 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.150
 I started under pressure look at the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.190
 people in this play and in this triangulation 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.230
 I crossed the ball took effect 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.239
 I did not think to take it and hit the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.030
 after skipping over 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.720
 Mass was not a near goal but I found it 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.159
 cool 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.250
 It was the closest goal I ever had 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.319
 so far 100 half time has not been much 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.389
 very busy time or around the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.370
 the second time the criciúma came back attacking 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.540
 again as it was in the first half 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.090
 but there the star of this guy shone and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.729
 master game accompanies in slow motion the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.599
 my first career goal as 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.959
 player 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.060
 my first goal of all games that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.370
 I did it and I marked it against criciúma 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.470
 I celebrated with style 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.840
 I finally celebrated with the staff. 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.459
 disenchant and made the first goal this 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.959
 excited even more 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.930
 I started to play better. I started to play. 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.400
 understand how you play and part 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.199
 up and put 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.750
 I'm glad people are glad that 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.240
 finally I made my first goal and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.030
 guarantee victory pro curitiba three 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.040
 points thanks to my goal 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.900
 after all it was 6.4 even so it was a note 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.760
 Bad but it's because I was very out. 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.260
 position has yet to learn how to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.070
 position on the field as a striker 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.100
 huh 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.260
 even more than how he plays in the middle of the fifa 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.600
 How we play, we know you play. 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.730
 in the middle is very complicated, do not enter the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.980
 defense is a quasi-mission 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.389
 difficult and that is the 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.919
 position I play then why 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.870
 take a low note because I 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.100
 automatically in the style of game I will 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.410
 straight through the corners 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.090
 so that makes us lose points there 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.910
 in the final average 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.800
 then the game against the inter was related 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.419
 good triangulation that resulted in 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.669
 The throw that I made the move did not 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.770
 nothing happened nothing happened but it's the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.300
 The kind of game I play is not and is the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.070
 kind of move I want from the cpu 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.990
 You too are looking at a ball. 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.150
 underneath and weakly wanted to 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.160
 ball on top and then in front of you, right? 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.720
 they do not do this kind of thing have a 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.320
 Good pass a good thigh that I 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.000
 made 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.590
 unfortunately it was not a goal and it was good that 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.780
 I earn many points not even for the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.729
 assistance and the pass at the front but 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.889
 did not work and then who noticed the 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.290
 bullshit I did I gave the cart 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.479
 there I actually asked for the crossroads but 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.460
 I pressed the crossover button was 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.160
 press the peace button and I ended up giving 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.650
 cart is not this is my level of 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.080
 player, this is how I am 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.539
 in a player's career then do not 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.280
 in peace but with that because I 'm still 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.630
 Bad I 'm getting used to now 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.229
 I'm getting better now I'm taking the 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.510
 way 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.860
 I scored a goal there, which for me is already 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.390
 fantastic is enough 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.030
 I'm very happy already in this episode 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.220
 I already scored so I'm happy end of the day. 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.560
 and was replaced by Alex Alex 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.120
 that the owner of the coritiba who was a 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.070
 of the reasons that I chose the coritiba 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.200
 there in the first episode I explain 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.330
 and we drew 0-0 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.600
 and then I received a compliment from the technician 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.850
 Master's game is fantastic and I understood 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.740
 do not understand why my average 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.780
 notes is 662 6.4 I did what a two goal 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.900
 assists I 'm not playing well now 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.080
 Come tell me it's fantastic, and you do not understand. 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.070
 But beauty, I accept the compliment, I did. 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.650
 the goal today 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.940
 I was praised so I'm even being in profit 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.380
 in this episode 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.120
 I want to show you a report of 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.550
 cast my points 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.990
 I have in general average 68 now I started 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.590
 with you 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.180
 7 I already celebrated my birthday in 19 years. 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.520
 increase in some expensive issues with a 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.510
 crossing head of dribbles increasing 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.630
 the dots there 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.800
 slowly the coritiba is in 12th in the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.110
 Brazilian championship 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.520
 Since I 'm not the coritiba, I do not 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.620
 I need to worry about the position of the 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.890
 team just have to do my part he 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.350
 and grow and for another team and that's it 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.880
 Hey, guys, this was the third episode. 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.770
 fourth episode soon 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.770
 Thank you so much, and even more.
