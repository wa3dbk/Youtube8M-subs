 wayne leaving this aside knows how to do 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 the first video of each month and a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.869
 recommendation of the book that really does not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 is a book are sometimes two or three 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 books in this case I have the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.390
 recommendation of all great books 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.250
 and this I bring because they send me in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 Sometimes personal comments on my 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 youtube account that tell me that the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.629
 books that I recommend are simply 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 fashion books or books for children with 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.960
 books for cheesy girls when 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 It really is not like that I already said 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.760
 previously the reading is for all 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.710
 everyone has their taste as well as each 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 who decides what to listen or how 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.180
 get dressed and in the end read what 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 that you read is something valuable because you're 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 reading and good taking advantage of not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.550
 matter what you read but the question is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.460
 What do you give? I bring you a magazine 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.230
 h for men this magazine is too 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 I look great, I can recommend it 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.450
 because there are very nice images 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.500
 there are images too 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 they are too interesting 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.560
 in jokes 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 as my god 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.549
 right now I come but once I get more 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.070
 unnecessary expense when it can be in 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.619
 way and free good either that's 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.970
 true with a little bit but the purchase is 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.860
 simply because the cover comes out 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 maribel guard and that magazine for 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.570
 two or three years but when we start 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.890
 stop talking about pornographic things and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 let's pass the students that I'm going to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 recommend who you have in mind have 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.700
 something erotic but a little bit nicer 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.920
 compared to the magazine and good 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.950
 let's start with the first book that is the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.600
 perfume of patrick süskind in general the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.280
 book mainly tells us about a 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.039
 approximately twenty young 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.740
 years of age he has the ability to 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.479
 sniffing or smelling things to great 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.580
 distance if you have the ability to 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.310
 keep in your memory the smells that already 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.040
 have previously obviated so that 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 after a mind that is presented to you x 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.819
 things I can already distinguish it so 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 easily or your sense of smell 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.860
 it's very developed in the movie 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.349
 city ​​in this talk about a young man who 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.060
 is trying to find the best 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.860
 perfume from around the world and this you're going 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.530
 through which is killing women 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.410
 virgins who are teenagers to steal 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.910
 its essence that is what transpires 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.459
 they only do this with women 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 virgins to teachers and that are very 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.630
 beautiful the way in how they do it is that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.530
 they are stripped naked and put on a type of butter 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.440
 all over his body 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.390
 good and the going is giving 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.790
 hours takes away the bandages that the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.490
 butter and at the same time now the essence of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.880
 women and that's how you get the 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.709
 perfect smell or the perfect perfume but 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.989
 actually the book is very different 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.030
 PT how you film the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.920
 book does not know that already free that is the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.230
 cello who is trying to get the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.989
 best perfume in the mouth, mainly from 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.140
 that this guy does not have a rose gold on 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.610
 nobel waddling imagine this could be 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.650
 a dream for many people how many 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.709
 as he does not smell like he does not sweat 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.290
 no smell anything he thinks no one 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.780
 will love that nobody will want is this 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.110
 the reason that starts looking for the best 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.750
 perfume for putting it on and then the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.850
 people can read it and fall in love or you 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.190
 of affection that is the only thing that is 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.260
 looking for affection for other people 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.200
 because because through its history 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.480
 since he was very young he was abandoned 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.370
 by certain people or was discriminated against 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 by certain people then 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.990
 logically he does not want to be looking for that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.770
 Affection as you can get 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.530
 according to his perception is that he can smell 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.630
 a thing and that the best today is 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.670
 nice way and mainly in that it 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.070
 it's about a guy's book that does not smell 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.810
 to nothing and who thinks that if he smells rich 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.640
 will find love or affection for 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.800
 other people I really recommend it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.110
 it's very good the book is very short is 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.420
 very entertaining and easily in two 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.880
 weeks are a lot you finish it because 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.920
 really is father the book is very 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.440
 advisable but good we should talk 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.170
 of the perfume and let's move on to the other book 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.720
 which is Latin American that is written 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.400
 by gabriel garcía marquez and I am 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.710
 talking about memories of my whores 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.230
 sad is a very small book like 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.540
 you can check has approximately 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.240
 109 leaves so if the perfume you 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.760
 you finish this book in two weeks 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.800
 you finish it in a week at the most 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.870
 how much can you say that it is bad or 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.040
 I do not know why it really is 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.600
 gabriel thanks to marquez and gabriel 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.590
 garcía marquez at least for me is 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.420
 synonymous with an exemplary book this book 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.090
 thanks to a teacher I had in the 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.040
 university because because the between the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.500
 teacher and I talked a lot about 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.870
 books and on one occasion he told me today come 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.570
 And he knows that I recommend you read 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.520
 memories of my sad whores really 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.110
 here I asked him why I say lean 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.940
 lubián the best is going to identify with 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.410
 the main character already when you buy 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.150
 and I read the book it really surprised me 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.400
 so what the teacher tried to tell me 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.110
 because when I finish it 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.050
 chooses that the teacher is thinking 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.670
 that I am going to be a depraved old man and 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.830
 that is still going to happen reading books 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.720
 and good because because the book of 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.950
 memory of my sad whores makes us 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.890
 reference of a person from the third 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.230
 age that usually have sex 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.770
 with prostitutes until on one occasion 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.840
 they get you a 15-year-old prostitute 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.400
 of age at the moment of believing enter the 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.220
 room to have sex 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.680
 with the young girl he discovers that the girl 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.420
 I was asleep and that obviously 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.490
 moment he saw her he was surprised 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.800
 why why 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.139
 a girl you drink because all that is that the 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.970
 main character that is Mr. 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.340
 I told the lady to get her the 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.340
 prostitutes that will turn the girl away 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.349
 every night and that nobody will take away 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.160
 his virginity because because he had 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.630
 in love with the girl not in a way to 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.610
 the best but phil doing a 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.310
 way the most fatherly best of at least 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.259
 the if I saw it really is very good 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.970
 book is very interesting is very 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.370
 father I'm just going to say that about this 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.319
 book because if you 're not going to alleviate believe me 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.030
 that you will not regret a certain point 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.009
 if you had to identify with the book 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.199
 I do not identify with what I am going to be a 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.319
 old pedophile and who has gone 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.880
 still reading but at least what 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.860
 I was left is I think that at least me 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.400
 It was with that was to take advantage of the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.620
 life to the maximum day to day with things 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.020
 positive or negative things to what 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.360
 better does this teaching also leave you 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.909
 I know but the book is very good 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.470
