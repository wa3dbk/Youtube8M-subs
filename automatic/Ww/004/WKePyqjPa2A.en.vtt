I've<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.730> developed<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> put<00:00:24.720> them

together is a series of six exercises
just<00:00:27.779> getting<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.260> four<00:00:28.529> limbs<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.070> tune<00:00:29.490> with

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just getting all four limbs in tune with

just getting all four limbs in tune with
each<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.210> find<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.619> studio

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
each other I find if I go into my studio

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
each other I find if I go into my studio
first<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.460> morning<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:32.910> pretty

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
first thing in the morning I'm pretty

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
first thing in the morning I'm pretty
rough<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> morning

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
rough and the more the morning

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100 
rough and the more the morning
progresses<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.390> better<00:00:36.600> cause<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:36.870> loose

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
progresses I get better cause I'm loose

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
progresses I get better cause I'm loose
I'm<00:00:37.320> limb<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.920> importantly<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> brain

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I'm limb and more importantly the brain

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.490 
I'm limb and more importantly the brain
can<00:00:39.300> process<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.809> information<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.410> I'm

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
can process the information that I'm

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
can process the information that I'm
throwing<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> limbs<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
throwing at the limbs so first off the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
throwing at the limbs so first off the
first<00:00:42.809> exercise<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.399> sixteenth<00:00:44.940> notes

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
first exercise is just sixteenth notes

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.439 
first exercise is just sixteenth notes
between<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.809> hand<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.800> foot<00:00:53.449> fairly

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
between right hand and right foot fairly

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.060 
between right hand and right foot fairly
straightforward<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.230> dominant<00:00:55.739> hand<00:00:55.920> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
straightforward our dominant hand is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
straightforward our dominant hand is
probably<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.090> handed

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
probably our right for a right handed

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
probably our right for a right handed
and<00:00:57.899> obviously<00:00:58.170> our<00:00:58.260> dominant<00:00:58.680> foot<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and obviously our dominant foot is the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
and obviously our dominant foot is the
right<00:00:59.399> foot<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.699> well<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.300> pretty

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
right foot as well so pretty

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.670 
right foot as well so pretty
straightforward<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
straightforward then we're going to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.900 
straightforward then we're going to
change<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> hand<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> keep<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
change the hand so I'm going to keep the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.429 
change the hand so I'm going to keep the
right<00:01:03.030> foot<00:01:03.090> plane<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> change<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
right foot plane I'm going to change the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:15.429 
right foot plane I'm going to change the
hand<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.909> first<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.869> one

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.420 

now<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> interesting<00:01:16.710> part<00:01:16.979> gets<00:01:17.189> slightly

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
now the interesting part gets slightly

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
now the interesting part gets slightly
more<00:01:17.549> difficult<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.479> change<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.900> right

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
more difficult is we change my right

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
more difficult is we change my right
foot<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:20.070> our<00:01:20.189> left<00:01:20.490> foot<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.880> exercise<00:01:21.420> three

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
foot to our left foot on exercise three

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
foot to our left foot on exercise three
back<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.650> hand<00:01:22.680> again<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> get

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
back to the right hand again so you get

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.859 
back to the right hand again so you get
this<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:28.430> exercise<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.479> pretty<00:01:30.750> much

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this one exercise for is are pretty much

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
this one exercise for is are pretty much
our<00:01:31.020> weaker<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.740> left<00:01:31.890> side<00:01:32.009> playing<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
our weaker side or left side playing the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.530 
our weaker side or left side playing the
sync<00:01:33.270> same<00:01:33.509> thing<00:01:33.689> again<00:01:33.869> sixteenth<00:01:34.380> notes<00:01:38.540> so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
sync same thing again sixteenth notes so

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
sync same thing again sixteenth notes so
let's<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> far<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.520> three

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
let's go that far one into two three

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:58.640 
let's go that far one into two three
into<00:01:42.329> four

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.840 

so<00:01:59.650> there's<00:01:59.830> four<00:02:00.070> you'll<00:02:00.520> find<00:02:00.730> that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
so there's four you'll find that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.580 
so there's four you'll find that
gradually<00:02:01.270> get<00:02:01.420> harder<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:02.350> go<00:02:02.500> along

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
gradually get harder as we go along

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.710 
gradually get harder as we go along
number<00:02:03.250> five<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.760> find<00:02:04.300> really<00:02:04.540> really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
number five I find really really

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.910 
number five I find really really
difficult<00:02:04.870> it's<00:02:05.230> playing<00:02:05.530> both<00:02:05.710> hands

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
difficult it's playing both hands

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.450 
difficult it's playing both hands
together

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
together

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.220 
together
no<00:02:07.210> flam's<00:02:07.510> really<00:02:07.840> important<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:08.260> don't<00:02:08.380> flap

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
no flam's really important we don't flap

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.060 
no flam's really important we don't flap
and<00:02:11.230> both<00:02:11.470> feet<00:02:11.770> together<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:14.650> surprised<00:02:14.920> how

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
and both feet together we surprised how

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.040 
and both feet together we surprised how
hard<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.430> because<00:02:15.910> naturally<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.870> want

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
hard that is because naturally we want

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.280 
hard that is because naturally we want
to<00:02:17.140> pretty<00:02:17.560> much<00:02:17.680> play<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> try<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.110> play

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
to pretty much play this so try and play

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:32.960 
to pretty much play this so try and play
equal<00:02:23.710> notes<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.820> that'll<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.120> five<00:02:28.390> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.650 

finally<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> hardest<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:34.510> me

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
finally the hardest one for me

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
six exercises now what I'd like you guys

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.210 
six exercises now what I'd like you guys
to<00:02:48.970> do<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.330> possible<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.170> write<00:02:50.770> down<00:02:50.800> yeah<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
to do if possible is write down yeah I

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.710 
to do if possible is write down yeah I
mean<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.489> have<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.670> metronome<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.270> your<00:02:52.600> on

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
mean you have a metronome on your on

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.170 
mean you have a metronome on your on
your<00:02:52.750> modules<00:02:53.200> write<00:02:53.410> down<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.739> BPM<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:55.030> each

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
your modules write down the BPM for each

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.600 
your modules write down the BPM for each
exercise<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.500> you'll<00:02:56.650> find<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.130> steady

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
exercise and you'll find a steady

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.310 
exercise and you'll find a steady
decline<00:02:57.850> on<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.450> tempos<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.020> they<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.290> they

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
decline on the tempos as they as they

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.170 
decline on the tempos as they as they
get<00:02:59.560> harder<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.489> idea<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.000> next

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
get harder and the idea of the next

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.550 
get harder and the idea of the next
couple<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.480> months<00:03:01.630> or<00:03:01.900> enjoying<00:03:02.410> your

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
couple of months or enjoying your

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.740 
couple of months or enjoying your
practice<00:03:02.950> time<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.850> speed<00:03:04.090> at<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.330> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
practice time is the speed at the the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.840 
practice time is the speed at the the
lowest<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> top<00:03:06.070> one<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.730> can

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
lowest one to the top one and you can

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.160 
lowest one to the top one and you can
see<00:03:06.880> some<00:03:07.209> some<00:03:07.570> progression<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.050> your

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
see some some progression in your

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.590 
see some some progression in your
playing<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.670> six<00:03:10.180> exercises

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
playing so that's it six exercises

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.930 
playing so that's it six exercises
fairly<00:03:11.530> straightforward<00:03:12.130> but<00:03:12.280> years<00:03:12.760> worth

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
fairly straightforward but years worth

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.440 
fairly straightforward but years worth
of<00:03:13.060> practice<00:03:13.209> see<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.110> next<00:03:14.320> time
