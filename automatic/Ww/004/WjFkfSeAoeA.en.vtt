00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
thrift store and look at these crazy

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.590 
thrift store and look at these crazy
crazy<00:03:07.320> snake-like<00:03:08.100> boot<00:03:08.910> things<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
crazy snake-like boot things and then I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.780 
crazy snake-like boot things and then I
saw<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:09.960> Korea<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.610> shirt<00:03:11.610> from

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
saw this Korea like shirt from

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.950 
saw this Korea like shirt from
Disneyland<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.390> thought<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.630> was<00:03:12.780> kind<00:03:12.930> of

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
Disneyland I thought that was kind of

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.080 
Disneyland I thought that was kind of
epic<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> took<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.860> picture<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.970> no

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
epic so I took a picture of that for no

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.790 
epic so I took a picture of that for no
particular<00:03:15.270> reason<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.290> moving<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.770> to

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
particular reason and then moving on to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.680 
particular reason and then moving on to
some<00:03:17.220> more<00:03:17.250> randomness<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.390> took<00:03:18.510> some

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
some more randomness I just took some

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.580 
some more randomness I just took some
pictures<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.110> these<00:03:19.200> nikeid<00:03:20.420> cork<00:03:21.590> features

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.820

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
and then they had all these in stock

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.680 
and then they had all these in stock
when<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.550> went<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:50.970> actually<00:03:51.180> filmed<00:03:51.630> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
when I went in and actually filmed this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.710 
when I went in and actually filmed this
video<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.709> can<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.120> actually<00:03:54.660> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
video and you can see this is actually a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.870 
video and you can see this is actually a
pair<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.260> Concord<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.700> they<00:03:56.820> were

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
pair of the Concord so so they were

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880 
pair of the Concord so so they were
called<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.750> our<00:03:58.470> land<00:03:58.739> o

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890

moving<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.400> another<00:04:02.580> good<00:04:02.790> we'll

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
moving on this is another good we'll

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.390 
moving on this is another good we'll
stop<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.050> ended<00:04:04.290> up<00:04:04.350> making<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.830> make<00:04:05.160> lots

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
stop that I ended up making I make lots

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.740 
stop that I ended up making I make lots
of<00:04:05.489> these<00:04:05.610> stops<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.360> try<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> combine

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
of these stops and I just try to combine

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.300 
of these stops and I just try to combine
them<00:04:07.019> into<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.230> video<00:04:07.560> when<00:04:07.709> i<00:04:07.769> get<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> chance<00:04:08.010> so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
them into a video when i get a chance so

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.460 
them into a video when i get a chance so
hopefully<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.700> okay<00:04:08.880> with<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.060> guys<00:04:09.470> these

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
hopefully it's okay with you guys these

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.199 
hopefully it's okay with you guys these
hurrah<00:04:10.709> cheese<00:04:10.920> were<00:04:11.070> samples<00:04:11.790> actually

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
hurrah cheese were samples actually

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.240 
hurrah cheese were samples actually
right<00:04:12.450> here<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.720> believe<00:04:12.810> her<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.709> think<00:04:14.160> these

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
right here I believe her I think these

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.740 
right here I believe her I think these
were<00:04:14.400> samples<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:14.850> Nike<00:04:15.090> IDs<00:04:15.300> I<00:04:15.480> guess<00:04:15.600> we'll

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
were samples or Nike IDs I guess we'll

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.470 
were samples or Nike IDs I guess we'll
see<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.049> second<00:04:17.120> they<00:04:18.120> look<00:04:18.269> kind<00:04:18.450> of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
see in a second they look kind of

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.210 
see in a second they look kind of
interesting<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.169> mesh<00:04:19.739> was<00:04:19.919> ripped<00:04:20.130> I

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
interesting that the mesh was ripped I

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.310 
interesting that the mesh was ripped I
think<00:04:20.400> these<00:04:20.489> are<00:04:20.609> samples<00:04:20.820> yeah<00:04:21.660> there<00:04:22.289> they

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
think these are samples yeah there they

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.580 
think these are samples yeah there they
are<00:04:22.410> right<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.860> some<00:04:23.070> samples<00:04:23.460> for<00:04:23.640> 2012

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
are right there so some samples for 2012

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.720 
are right there so some samples for 2012
random<00:04:25.590> samples<00:04:25.950> that

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
random samples that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.250 
random samples that
had<00:04:26.850> their<00:04:27.000> these<00:04:27.150> ones<00:04:27.360> are<00:04:27.450> another<00:04:27.960> pair<00:04:28.230> of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
had their these ones are another pair of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.170 
had their these ones are another pair of
Sam<00:04:28.470> or<00:04:28.830> no<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.100> was<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.220> other<00:04:29.310> one<00:04:29.490> sorry

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
Sam or no that was the other one sorry

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.580 
Sam or no that was the other one sorry
that<00:04:30.600> was<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.780> other<00:04:30.900> one<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.170> these<00:04:31.290> ones

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that was the other one and these ones

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.910 
that was the other one and these ones
are<00:04:31.740> some<00:04:32.070> air<00:04:32.400> max<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:33.870> had<00:04:34.020> their<00:04:34.500> MX

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
are some air max that they had their MX

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.700 
are some air max that they had their MX
ones<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.960> then<00:04:36.960> they<00:04:37.050> had<00:04:37.200> some<00:04:37.530> other

ones and then they had some other

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.230 
ones and then they had some other
randomness<00:04:38.190> here<00:04:38.580> those<00:04:38.730> ones<00:04:38.910> are<00:04:39.000> twenty

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
randomness here those ones are twenty

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.970 
randomness here those ones are twenty
dollars<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:40.350> they<00:04:40.470> had<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> couple<00:04:40.800> more

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
dollars then they had a couple more

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.920 
dollars then they had a couple more
samples<00:04:41.430> just<00:04:41.490> randomness<00:04:42.090> again<00:04:42.480> these<00:04:42.690> ones

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
samples just randomness again these ones

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.660 
samples just randomness again these ones
are<00:04:43.050> where<00:04:43.320> test<00:04:43.560> samples<00:04:43.980> it<00:04:44.130> says<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.490> think

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
are where test samples it says I think

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.090 
are where test samples it says I think
as<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.540> can<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.840> right<00:04:45.870> here<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.950> where

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
as you can see right here we have where

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.460 
as you can see right here we have where
test<00:04:47.310> sample<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.120> Mariah<00:04:48.450> hot<00:04:48.750> never<00:04:49.200> seen

test sample the Mariah hot never seen

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.350 
test sample the Mariah hot never seen
those<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:49.890> $27<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.820> looks<00:04:50.940> like<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.150> was<00:04:51.240> on

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
those but $27 it looks like it was on

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.080 
those but $27 it looks like it was on

of the function is but kind of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.270 
of the function is but kind of
interesting<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.650> next<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> good
