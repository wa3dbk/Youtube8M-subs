00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
in this case this is juniper i need to

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.280 
in this case this is juniper i need to
create<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:18.030> fluffy<00:01:18.450> stuff<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
create some fluffy stuff like this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100 
create some fluffy stuff like this
remember<00:01:20.130> surface<00:01:20.580> area<00:01:20.910> is<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> key<00:01:21.480> in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
remember surface area is the key in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
remember surface area is the key in
creating<00:01:22.620> ignition<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> i<00:01:23.730> just<00:01:23.910> put<00:01:24.150> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
creating ignition so if i just put this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
creating ignition so if i just put this
down<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.050> try<00:01:25.290> striking<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.100> spark

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
down and I try striking it with my spark

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.580 
down and I try striking it with my spark
ride<00:01:26.730> where<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.540> match<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.500> work

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
ride where my match is not going to work

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
ride where my match is not going to work

motion and bust up the grasses or the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.740 
motion and bust up the grasses or the
bark<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.159> real<00:01:35.370> fluffy<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.450> hair

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
so that's what I've done to create this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.280 
so that's what I've done to create this
put<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.520> down<00:01:49.790> in<00:01:50.090> here<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:50.930> don't<00:01:51.110> have
