00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.779
 world around me 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.090
 s.paulo anime and well with me become a 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.430
 pokémon master my story started 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.730
 in videogames more precisely in the year 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.850
 of 1996, in which the first 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.730
 edition of pokémon in rpg format for the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.989
 nintendo game boy game that due to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.820
 to the sinister success 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.300
 the company decided to invest its time and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.620
 money in my life story 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.109
 initially the pokémon world does not 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.329
 would call so at the beginning of everything the saga 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.309
 had the name of capsule monsters and the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.649
 coaches used whips to make 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.810
 their best but monsters vote 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.730
 due to record problems this 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.130
 name was abandoned as well as the idea 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.890
 of the whip causing pokémon to be 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.790
 the new brand that has as meaning 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.220
 pocket monsters 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.800
 a lot of people do not know but my 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.730
 name of truth is toshi as well as 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.070
 my creator 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.870
 'This is like all the people in the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.790
 West call me because I'm more 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.760
 familiar with the Western world 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 I almost started my journey Pokemon 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.990
 training but prefers instead of my 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.730
 great friend pikachu the only change 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.680
 occurred because of a decision by the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 Nintendo's board that decided that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.820
 pikachu would be popular both among 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 boys and girls different from 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.460
 says that he is a Pokémon theoretically 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.320
 female 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.720
 pokémon is one of the biggest franchises 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.580
 created in the 1990s influenced 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.830
 completely the life of any child 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.930
 of that generation which has generated countless 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.520
 products of the saga will tell me that you 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.800
 never bought several wanderers for 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.420
 cause of the cards or the good old pet 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.590
 little one coming with a one bit soft 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.810
 Pokémon 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.370
 how do you know everything that reaches thousands 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.100
 of people and has a legion of fans 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.830
 most different causes possible reactions 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 among them the most absurd theses already 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 created were those of the churches that accused 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.580
 series of satanic seals having as 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.560
 justify the story that pokémon 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.630
 demons will be imprisoned in the few 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.209
 balls that were imputed to fight 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.270
 among themselves and that the gymnasium teaches them 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.709
 instruments of control in the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.540
 from my journey to become 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.730
 a pokémon master many adventures 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.190
 mine were forbidden to be counted 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 in most cases they were censored 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.410
 completely coarse, but there were 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.750
 situations as in adventure as a pole that 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.650
 cause epileptic seizures in more than 500 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.300
 children 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.370
 fact that inspired the northern government 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.930
 the United States to create a free 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.569
 have the same effect against their 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.489
 opponents in my travels with the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.400
 my friends always come across 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.350
 clips and curious pokémon many of them 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.380
 full of incredible details 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.900
 among them it is worth quoting the pokémon 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.700
 a rhythm a camp pace and they have these 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.680
 two names in honor of two of the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.739
 Asian movie 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.110
 action without the chan and continue the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.510
 Psychic pokémon browse inspired by a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.400
 anta because according to Japanese folklore 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 these animals feed on dreams and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.829
 human nightmares himself a romão that 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.660
 has two small how - in your head 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.299
 as you may know some mushrooms 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.549
 are fungi in some cases control the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.890
 of some creatures in evolution 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.560
 his to pay 7 your body to stay 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.239
 huge, fully developed and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.790
 This notes that the eyes of the Pokémon 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.859
 are completely displaced by doing 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.880
 anyone to understand that for 7 is a 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.350
 pokémon controlled by a fungus 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 many believe that the sayings were 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.209
 failed attempt of konar thousand since 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.310
 both have no defined sex they have the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.049
 same color weight status 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 and both are the only ones who 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.260
 can learn naturally 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.900
 transportation skill 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.120
 the evidence increases when we know 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.280
 that the yellow pokémon of has counted in the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.950
 pokémon manson that is cloning site 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.290
 of the thousand and also in the Syrian case where you 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.230
 can fight against useful 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.090
 changing subject in 2001 a game of 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.209
 letters because he was not a thug in Arabia 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.160
 Saudi for looking like a game of chance 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.259
 haydon was the first pokémon created 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.120
 although the plot has several 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.410
 prehistoric and partner pokémon 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.270
 as the first of all 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.610
 the edu is the firstborn of all 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.710
 pokémon and that is why there are several 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.930
 free statues in the game settings 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.030
 series on an island called anime that is 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.380
 associated with new zealand the same as 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.630
 time behind a video to be the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.669
 first country to have free wi fi called 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 the attention of the world again to have 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.160
 created a commemorative edition of his 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.930
 coins 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.539
 homage to classic pokémons of 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.820
 first generation and to close 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.900
 Did you know that in spain due to 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.780
 numerous corruption scandals 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.610
 policy was created to operate the Pokémon and 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.710
 that we had as motto we have to get 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.330
 thing that Brazil could follow the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.280
 example and do the same 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.550
 although they would lack balls for 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.650
 There's so much left over dolls we 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.479
 end of the video I'm going to stay here 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.400
