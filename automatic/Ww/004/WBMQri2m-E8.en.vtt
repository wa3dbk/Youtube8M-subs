I'm<00:00:07.929> gonna<00:00:08.109> talk<00:00:08.260> about<00:00:08.380> pruning<00:00:08.769> raspberries

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.429 
I'm gonna talk about pruning raspberries

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.879 
I'm gonna talk about pruning raspberries
today<00:00:09.700> there<00:00:10.540> are<00:00:10.660> two<00:00:10.839> different<00:00:11.230> growth

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
today there are two different growth

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.919 
today there are two different growth
types<00:00:12.309> of<00:00:12.549> raspberries<00:00:13.209> there<00:00:13.419> they're<00:00:13.749> all<00:00:13.900> a

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
types of raspberries there they're all a

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.090 
types of raspberries there they're all a
perennial<00:00:14.889> root<00:00:15.639> with<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.119> biennial<00:00:16.390> cane<00:00:17.100> some

perennial root with a biennial cane some

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.029 
perennial root with a biennial cane some
are<00:00:18.280> called<00:00:18.689> everbearing<00:00:19.689> or<00:00:20.109> fall<00:00:20.529> bearing

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
are called everbearing or fall bearing

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.999 
are called everbearing or fall bearing
or<00:00:21.310> primal<00:00:21.910> cane<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.390> then<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.529> other<00:00:23.740> type

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
or primal cane and then the other type

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.589 
or primal cane and then the other type
of<00:00:24.039> growth<00:00:24.310> habit<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.759> old<00:00:24.880> traditional<00:00:25.420> type

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
bearing or flora cane raspberries will

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.140 
bearing or flora cane raspberries will
come<00:00:33.730> up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
come up

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.600 
come up
thus<00:00:34.570> they'll<00:00:35.050> send<00:00:35.320> up<00:00:35.440> there's<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.160> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
thus they'll send up there's the the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.389 
thus they'll send up there's the the
cane<00:00:36.910> one<00:00:37.809> year<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.350> then<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.680> second<00:00:39.190> year

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
cane one year and then the second year

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.029 
cane one year and then the second year
is<00:00:39.579> when<00:00:39.760> they<00:00:39.940> flower<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.600> fruit<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.890> you

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
is when they flower and fruit then you

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.470 
is when they flower and fruit then you
prune<00:00:42.280> those<00:00:42.460> differently<00:00:42.969> than<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.270> would

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
prune those differently than you would

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.540 
prune those differently than you would
with<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.840> primer<00:00:44.110> cane<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.980> primer<00:00:45.250> cane

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
with the primer cane the primer cane

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.610 
with the primer cane the primer cane
raspberries<00:00:46.180> are<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.420> everbearing<00:00:46.930> or<00:00:47.260> fall

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
raspberries are the everbearing or fall

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.689 
raspberries are the everbearing or fall
bearing<00:00:47.949> raspberries

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
bearing raspberries

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.479 
bearing raspberries
they'll<00:00:49.210> send<00:00:49.780> up<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.079> cane<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.620> they<00:00:51.340> will

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
they'll send up the cane and they will

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.299 
they'll send up the cane and they will
flower<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.120> fruit<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.449> same<00:00:53.050> year<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:54.160> it's

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
flower and fruit that same year so it's

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.639 
flower and fruit that same year so it's
all<00:00:54.460> on<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.789> first<00:00:55.030> year<00:00:55.210> cane<00:00:55.510> but<00:00:56.500> they

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
all on that first year cane but they

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.830 
all on that first year cane but they
will<00:00:56.859> also<00:00:57.100> in<00:00:57.579> that<00:00:57.789> second<00:00:58.329> year<00:00:58.570> if<00:00:58.719> they

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
will also in that second year if they

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.590 
will also in that second year if they
haven't<00:00:59.199> used<00:01:00.010> up<00:01:00.219> all<00:01:00.429> their<00:01:00.579> flowering<00:01:01.359> buds

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
haven't used up all their flowering buds

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.720 
haven't used up all their flowering buds
they<00:01:02.140> will<00:01:02.320> come<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.679> that<00:01:02.829> second<00:01:03.309> year<00:01:03.370> and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
they will come in that second year and

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.510 
they will come in that second year and
do<00:01:04.269> some<00:01:04.510> more<00:01:04.800> flowering<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:05.920> fruiting<00:01:06.190> so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
do some more flowering and fruiting so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.190 
do some more flowering and fruiting so
you<00:01:06.610> could<00:01:06.970> prune<00:01:07.210> them<00:01:07.360> like<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.720> do<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.900> flora

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
you could prune them like to do a flora

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
you could prune them like to do a flora
cane<00:01:08.530> but<00:01:09.159> generally<00:01:09.520> speaking<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:10.090> prima

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
cane but generally speaking with prima

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.140 
cane but generally speaking with prima
canes<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:11.350> want<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.740> prune<00:01:11.979> them<00:01:12.189> so<00:01:12.970> that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
canes you want to prune them so that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.179 
canes you want to prune them so that
they<00:01:13.299> just<00:01:13.330> sent<00:01:13.810> up<00:01:13.900> a<00:01:13.990> chute<00:01:14.229> send<00:01:14.950> out<00:01:15.070> the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
they just sent up a chute send out the

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.490 
they just sent up a chute send out the
flowers<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.820> fruit<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.080> cut<00:01:17.320> them

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
flowers and fruit and then you cut them

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.310 
flowers and fruit and then you cut them
off<00:01:17.740> they're<00:01:18.310> very<00:01:18.549> nice<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.090> handle<00:01:19.509> in<00:01:20.079> our

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
off they're very nice to handle in our

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.050 
off they're very nice to handle in our
country<00:01:20.829> in<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> high<00:01:21.250> desert<00:01:21.310> country<00:01:21.790> of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
country in the high desert country of

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.960 
country in the high desert country of
Utah<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.619> primal<00:01:24.189> cane<00:01:24.369> is<00:01:24.520> actually<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
Utah the primal cane is actually the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.050 
Utah the primal cane is actually the
better<00:01:25.150> raspberry<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.290> grow<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.820> four

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
better raspberry to grow the the four

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.350 
better raspberry to grow the the four
canes<00:01:28.420> they<00:01:29.409> don't<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:30.009> as<00:01:30.280> well<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:31.060> get<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
canes they don't do as well we get the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120 
canes they don't do as well we get the
warming<00:01:31.810> in<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> spring<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.619> then<00:01:32.770> freezing

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
warming in the spring and then freezing

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.620 
warming in the spring and then freezing
warming<00:01:33.729> freezing<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.210> then<00:01:34.299> we<00:01:34.360> get<00:01:34.479> our

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
warming freezing and then we get our

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.960 
warming freezing and then we get our
strong<00:01:34.990> spring<00:01:35.350> winds<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:35.979> they<00:01:36.610> tend<00:01:36.880> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
strong spring winds and they tend to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.940 
strong spring winds and they tend to
kill<00:01:37.240> those<00:01:37.450> flora<00:01:37.990> canes<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.710> flora

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
kill those flora canes so the flora

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.219 
kill those flora canes so the flora
canes<00:01:39.220> don't<00:01:39.490> do<00:01:39.700> quite<00:01:40.000> as<00:01:40.149> well<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
canes don't do quite as well as the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.740 
canes don't do quite as well as the
Prima<00:01:41.470> canes<00:01:41.740> do<00:01:42.040> but<00:01:42.939> I'll<00:01:43.119> show<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.450> how<00:01:43.689> to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
Prima canes do but I'll show you how to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.770 
Prima canes do but I'll show you how to
do<00:01:43.990> pruning<00:01:44.530> for<00:01:44.740> both<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.159> those<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:46.149> that<00:01:46.180> so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
do pruning for both of those so that so

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.060 
do pruning for both of those so that so
that<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.170> see<00:01:47.350> if<00:01:47.439> you've<00:01:47.590> got<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.799> floor

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
that you can see if you've got a floor

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.069 
that you can see if you've got a floor
it<00:01:48.189> came<00:01:48.369> variety<00:01:48.850> or<00:01:48.969> whatever<00:01:49.210> now<00:01:49.840> some<00:01:50.049> of

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
it came variety or whatever now some of

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.690

my my raspberry bed here and I don't
have<00:05:29.919> any<00:05:31.440> work<00:05:32.440> aid<00:05:32.650> we'll<00:05:32.860> just<00:05:33.039> assume<00:05:33.340> that

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
have any work aid we'll just assume that

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.689 
have any work aid we'll just assume that
these<00:05:34.090> were<00:05:34.300> last<00:05:34.539> year's<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:36.340> was<00:05:36.430> last

out first and then once I get to that

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:51.839 
out first and then once I get to that
point<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.820> want<00:05:46.509> to<00:05:46.630> thin<00:05:46.930> out<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:50.849> remaining

and they flower they're not going to
crowd<00:06:56.350> out<00:06:56.380> as<00:06:56.680> much<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:57.070> production<00:06:57.550> is<00:06:57.669> a

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
crowd out as much the production is a

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.830 
crowd out as much the production is a
little<00:06:57.940> bit<00:06:58.030> better<00:06:58.210> if<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:58.419> do<00:06:58.570> it<00:06:58.600> that<00:06:58.780> way

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840

little bit better if you do it that way
than<00:06:59.230> if<00:06:59.380> it's<00:06:59.560> crowded<00:06:59.740> with<00:07:00.190> the<00:07:00.280> primary

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
than if it's crowded with the primary

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.360 
than if it's crowded with the primary
canes<00:07:00.850> you<00:07:01.390> just<00:07:01.570> whack<00:07:01.780> them<00:07:01.990> all<00:07:02.169> off<00:07:02.410> and

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
canes you just whack them all off and

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.550 
canes you just whack them all off and
let<00:07:03.550> it<00:07:03.669> blow<00:07:03.820> up<00:07:03.850> this<00:07:03.970> next<00:07:04.180> year<00:07:04.470> so<00:07:05.470> that's

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
let it blow up this next year so that's

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.510
