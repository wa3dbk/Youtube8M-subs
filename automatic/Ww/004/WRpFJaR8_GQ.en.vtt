question<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:57.420> cool<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.689> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
question so it's pretty cool right there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
question so it's pretty cool right there
I<00:01:58.250> heard<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.460> America<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
I heard that in America they have

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.880 
I heard that in America they have
something<00:02:00.420> called<00:02:00.570> Superman<00:02:01.380> days<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
something called Superman days so I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
something called Superman days so I
understand<00:02:02.430> why<00:02:02.579> Japan<00:02:02.820> decided<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
understand why Japan decided to make a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
understand why Japan decided to make a
Goku<00:02:03.899> day<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.619> guess<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.040> probably<00:02:05.280> about

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
Goku day and I guess it's probably about

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
Goku day and I guess it's probably about
time<00:02:05.700> decided<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
time decided to do that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.300 
time decided to do that
