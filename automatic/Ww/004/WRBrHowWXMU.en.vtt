00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:12.719
Ladies and Gentlemen, Church and State!

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.780
Woah, Woah, Woah.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.840
Woah, Woah, Woah.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.860
Oooooh

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:37.910
I need to talk to you if i can find my way
I am all knowing so i'm knowing what you'll

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.910
say

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.850
You always take control, hate when you play
that role

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.970
I gotta be strong cuz baby we don't belong
together

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.690
I wish i knew what makes me do the things
i do

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
You are divine my love when you're just doing
you

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:13.510
See there is good in me, but bad is all you
see

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:23.393
Could've been wrong, maybe we don't belong
together

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:26.280
We're church and state
And we need to separate

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.640
Cuz we're all up on each other and we're hurting
one another and it's causing hate

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.080
Been together for way too long
Your rights have been my wrongs

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.700
We need to separate church and state

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.229
How' ma gonna keep my prayers off of your
schools

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.990
You can do it baby, just follow your golden
rule

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.619
With a body like that i can't think straight

00:01:50.619 --> 00:02:00.680
That's why you make it so hard when i legislate

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:14.470
We will never see eye to eye
So let's just say goodbye

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.470
And know we'll see each other again

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.470
With Adam and Eve up in heaven

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.470
Or Adam and Steve up in...

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.470
Shhhhhhh

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.470
Were church and state
And we need to separate

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.330
Cuz we're all up in each other and we're hurting
one another and it's causing hate

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:43.050
Been together for way too long
Your rights have been my wrongs

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:54.550
We need to separate church and state

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:08.220
Please baby don't let it end this way
i get weak when i hear you pray

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.220
Fa la la la la la la

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220
We need to separate church and state

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.220
Go ahead, try to forget me, State.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.450
But my name will always be in your courts...
and on your money.
