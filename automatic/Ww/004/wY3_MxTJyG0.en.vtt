 something amazing that's how you can see it 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.330
 I have a pet that is a mouse but 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.519
 this is not the most important thing they are 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.619
 thing that I am holding here this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 mouse that will be amazing only 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.910
 It costs $ 38 so it's going to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 convert to Mexican currency is less than 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 600 pesos is incredible more costs 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 less than 600 pesos and really worth 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 much more worth it thicker than three 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.149
 one thousand two thousand pesos 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.149
 find out why my life 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.240
 never 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.310
 and well, as I said at the beginning 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.110
 of the video I just sent a new 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.970
 mouse that is amazing you know that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'm doing reviews in boxing in the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.520
 channel for you to check all the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.170
 peripherals there are mouse keyboards 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.330
 headsets all that is the peripheral 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 gaming that there is and that you can 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.369
 make a review on which is better than 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.920
 price go into details and eye that no 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 he forced them to buy I just give them 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.510
 reviews and reviews and that's it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 say in the comments if it's okay or 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.790
 it is wrong 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 this time they sent me this 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.090
 call venus that as they could 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 listen to the principle the I do not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 I'm kidding 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.910
 this is worth $ 38 and I'm putting the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.700
 link below in the description so that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.500
 go to amazon de usa if you are from spain 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 the link will also be left so that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.440
 give one so is you are always 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 asking and also and that where are we 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.160
 located these subss so I've 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.440
 asked this company not to be gachos 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.960
 send us an extra one to 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.330
 give them to you so good 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.220
 a lot of talk let's start with this 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 what 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.750
 I also give boxing on the screen 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.550
 then they are fine one is amazing me 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
 they sent him the best of this I want 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.240
 say that it really impressed me a lot 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 is that the mouse sent it to me from 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.970
 Chinese the mouse sent it to me from 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.220
 china and when it arrived arrived in a package 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.290
 very well to the mattress ado very well 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.150
 insured and how can you see it here in 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.280
 screen now already leaving in a boxing 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.860
 is super good has no effect 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.630
 the box they send super super well 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.820
 insured to make a bausch 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.110
 but good here we have the mouse that I 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.790
 I really liked art, I'm going to give you my 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.860
 points of view we can explain as much 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 important that you should know about this is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 a gaming mouse that has the controller 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.500
 of dp and a sensor that remember that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.150
 you can make it super 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.430
 super fast when moving the mouse 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.050
 or very very slow I'm going to show you 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.209
 here as you can see in these arrows 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.190
 what's here on these dates can 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.709
 go up they do not realize how the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.530
 lights or can lower it that's the sensor 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.080
 and the best thing about this is that you can 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.709
 adjust the dt and they need to 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.220
 example for very high ones would be 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.220
 16,000 for me very high would be 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.540
 4000 let's not suppose it's 4000 good 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.910
 we can adjust in the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.030
 controller that the highest here is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.650
 higher be 4000 but beware that this one 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.130
 has a maximum of 16 thousand 400 I 'm not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.490
 joking 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.650
 there's the screen as 16,400 of pi 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.850
 I tell you, you can adjust everything 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.010
 this in the controller 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.400
 the mouse design is very nice is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.320
 attractive is gamer is executive so 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.230
 say it for the black mate I like the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.110
 truth let's put the design and how 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.570
 you can see all this here is mate if the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 The mouse body is cheering and the only thing 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.920
 what is different is this little 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.870
 detail here that is in black 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120
 bright ok is a nice touch is a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.280
 nice detail out there also the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.620
 little things are the keys of the macros 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.560
 who is 12 and they realize they have 12 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.330
 there they are equally matte and something that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.270
 I really like this thing that they are 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.310
 seeing here this thing gives you a support 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.490
 incredible when it comes to putting your hand in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.920
 the mouse is part of your big toe drops 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.600
 unbelievable is the swear was in out 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.370
 forever 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.230
 he also has weights for this mouse 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.390
 has a lot to do a cheap mouse 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.980
 the truth does not impress in this part of 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.500
 here also what here are in life in 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.930
 screen opens and when it opens they leave 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.820
 some weights I had already told you is another 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.280
 mouse that those weights are so that 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.770
 you get the mouse and lighter or 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.690
 heavier depends on you what can 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.730
 save in that curious little box that they're 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.890
 seeing there and already you if you want to be the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.320
 lighter or heavier mouse all 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.270
 depending on you not well off 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.070
 because the truth is that the hands were 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.750
 Pretty ergonomic medical in my hand 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.510
 every perfect I do not know if they see it every 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.580
 perfect and no finger is left flying 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.350
 nothing and that I do not have a hand so and 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.910
 I have a little hand that I guess is 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.650
 in a steady hand in this one the moment 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.750
 stable so at the moment that what 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.090
 I put in the macros are very good 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.920
 has 12 macros remember that the macros 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.590
 are for you to put any 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.510
 button any button in that macro and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.460
 You can also make this control 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.830
 that this control that this mouse has 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.720
 the LEDs that you want like this is with the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.220
 software you can change this color you 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.240
 I have green but I'm going to turn off the light 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.430
 for you to see it 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.259
 this now looks much better already for 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.360
 the light for the short night I have it in 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.400
 green if they notice and is static 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.289
 but you can do these seven 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.389
 holes too but I'm going to the 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.910
 chivas if I want to get something red or 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.979
 something distinctive of my team 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.590
 you can put my girls red 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.110
 and how can they be seeing a brit 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.630
 makes a respite shine means 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.550
 breathe is the definition and here they have 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.430
 the mice are used a lot for this if you 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.560
 they give account turns on and off turns on and off 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.940
 and you can regulate what can 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 regular if they want me to pledge like this 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.870
 fast is already I put it as fast 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.970
 as you can see it is very fast what 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.340
 is doing the effect of light then 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.860
 they can do it much slower and that 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.150
 come back or super super slow or like what 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.949
 they saw the beginning of the mouse that is 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.470
 static imagine that you in a 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.310
 Gamer girl, we want it, not rosita 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.919
 that to see this can choose the color 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.930
 who want also change even here 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.159
 also these things change then 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.470
 you can choose the color that 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.249
 want they can put it in yellow or 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.639
 Red 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.889
 purple blue all colors are in 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.869
 this mouse with the simple controller 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.539
 you can put everything you want 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:17.819
 the truth is that the truth is incredible 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.069
 I found more shadow more than anything 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.779
 more amazement for the price as I say 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.609
 if you like too much this and 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.949
 want to take advantage of the price or they want it 

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:28.289
 give away or whatever for the price I have 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.179
 got that they also have a code 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.699
 discount without keeping the code 

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:34.889
 talent 'mx in the part where the 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.359
 discount codes such in tmx thomas 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.369
 I'm going to leave the code in the 

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:42.360
 description for you to see they are going to 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:45.929
 have not only 3 % nothing not 15 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.929
 cent to have 10% discount on 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:51.360
 this thing over there to finish the best of 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:53.339
 these are the 12 macros that you have has 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.739
 12 macros for you to put it 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.839
 different as you want there are 

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:59.129
 highlight that they have the LEDs that you 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.009
 they can put it to the color they want 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:06.329
 is super super configurable has the 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:08.579
 pp and to teach you here up to 16,400 

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:11.039
 that that's brutality and I was 

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.700
 quite ergonomic is pretty good 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.590
 and the 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.140
 I think it meets the requirements 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.760
 for a mouse of this price that they 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.160
 have liked the review you know that 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.420
 you decide what to do with them I 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.610
 I will be testing it because I liked it 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.560
 Much of left and 12 macros and 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.690
 remember to put in the comments all 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.100
 what they want to know or discuss there in 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.560
 the comments why they were made 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.790
 you good that not and see you in the 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.790
 next video my levels
