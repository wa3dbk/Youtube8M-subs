00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
for the gas line you think it would be

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.950 
for the gas line you think it would be
better<00:03:09.350> just<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.620> wait<00:03:10.240> because<00:03:11.240> really<00:03:11.690> if<00:03:11.900> I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
better just to wait because really if I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.070 
better just to wait because really if I
have<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> hole<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.740> wall<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.600> kind<00:03:14.960> of<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
have a hole in the wall it is kind of a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.690 
have a hole in the wall it is kind of a
pain<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.290> plug<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.800> hole<00:03:15.980> because<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.490> looks

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
pain to plug the hole because it looks

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:38.350 
pain to plug the hole because it looks
funny<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:21.020> think<00:03:21.080> plug<00:03:21.920> holes<00:03:22.220> look<00:03:37.360> yeah

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
funny you think plug holes look yeah

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.870 
funny you think plug holes look yeah
that's<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.840> make<00:03:39.140> sense<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.830> was<00:03:40.550> just<00:03:40.700> trying

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
that's that make sense I was just trying

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.500 
that's that make sense I was just trying
to<00:03:40.910> free<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.300> garage<00:03:41.630> for<00:03:42.550> workshop<00:03:46.510> right

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
to free up the garage for workshop right

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.840 
to free up the garage for workshop right
oh<00:03:48.020> that's<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.070> reason<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:49.490> lock<00:03:49.700> them

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
oh that's the reason I don't lock them

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.510 
oh that's the reason I don't lock them
in<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.000> garage<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.590> if<00:03:54.920> it's<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.310> basement

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
in the garage but if it's in a basement

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.030 
in the garage but if it's in a basement
it<00:03:55.760> has<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.030> be<00:03:56.120> tell<00:03:56.330> you<00:03:56.420> right<00:03:56.600> yes<00:03:57.140> yes<00:03:57.800> so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
it has to be tell you right yes yes so

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.510 
it has to be tell you right yes yes so
is<00:03:58.130> it

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
is it

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.370 
is it
so<00:03:59.000> then<00:03:59.180> man<00:03:59.360> hold<00:03:59.600> on<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.900> basement<00:04:00.080> alone

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
so then man hold on the basement alone

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.960 
so then man hold on the basement alone
there's<00:04:00.680> no<00:04:00.709> automobiles<00:04:01.310> coming<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.820> here

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
there's no automobiles coming in here

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.030 
there's no automobiles coming in here
see<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.930> only<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.230> only<00:04:03.380> reason<00:04:03.680> why<00:04:03.800> it's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
see the only the only reason why it's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.380 
see the only the only reason why it's
that<00:04:04.160> way<00:04:04.490> in<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.730> garage<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:07.000> carbon<00:04:08.000> oxides

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
that way in a garage is carbon oxides

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.120 
that way in a garage is carbon oxides
five<00:04:08.780> years<00:04:09.170> ago<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.470> thought<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:09.800> changed

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
five years ago so I thought they changed

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.770 
five years ago so I thought they changed
the<00:04:10.220> code<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.670> cover<00:04:10.910> basements<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:13.780> don't

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the code to cover basements to I don't

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.250 
the code to cover basements to I don't
know<00:04:14.930> get<00:04:15.200> me<00:04:15.350> wrong<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:19.810> want<00:04:20.810> at<00:04:20.870> least<00:04:20.930> take<00:04:21.230> a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
know get me wrong I want at least take a

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.520 
know get me wrong I want at least take a
tape<00:04:21.560> measure<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.670> measure<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.540> try<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.290> find

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
tape measure and measure it try to find

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.960 
tape measure and measure it try to find
it<00:04:24.710> yeah

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:38.020 

because<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.120> goes<00:04:32.840> down<00:04:33.840> there<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> street

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.310 

that's<00:04:39.030> gonna<00:04:39.240> be<00:04:39.300> an<00:04:39.390> awful<00:04:39.660> dig<00:04:39.810> if<00:04:39.960> we<00:04:40.080> can't

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
that's gonna be an awful dig if we can't

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.980 
that's gonna be an awful dig if we can't
find<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.740> somewhere<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.220> here<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.930> you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990

okay the bid I'm gonna give you will be
I'll<00:05:02.220> figure<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.670> water<00:05:02.850> line<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.330> because

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
I'll figure the water line in because

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.540 
I'll figure the water line in because
that's<00:05:03.690> that's<00:05:04.050> pretty<00:05:04.260> simple<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.250> found<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
that's that's pretty simple I found the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.210 
that's that's pretty simple I found the
leader<00:05:06.170> but<00:05:07.170> I'm<00:05:07.290> not<00:05:07.440> gonna<00:05:07.590> figure<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.950> in

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
leader but I'm not gonna figure this in

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:39.360 
leader but I'm not gonna figure this in
until<00:05:08.370> we<00:05:08.550> know<00:05:08.900> okay

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370
