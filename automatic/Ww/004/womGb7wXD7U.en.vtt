00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
which brand you choose you want to use a

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.360 
which brand you choose you want to use a
high-quality<00:00:37.089> glue<00:00:37.870> not<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.859> one<00:00:39.039> that<00:00:39.159> comes

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
high-quality glue not the one that comes

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.520 
high-quality glue not the one that comes
with<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.760> crack<00:00:39.969> and<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.719> strongly<00:00:41.050> recommend

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
with the crack and I strongly recommend

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.709 
with the crack and I strongly recommend
to<00:00:41.620> use<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.859> glue<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:42.280> dries<00:00:42.460> clear<00:00:42.819> not<00:00:43.389> black

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
to use a glue that dries clear not black

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.599 
to use a glue that dries clear not black
so<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.229> don't<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.710> worry<00:00:45.010> if<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.280> gets<00:00:45.489> a

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
so you don't have to worry if it gets a

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.000 
so you don't have to worry if it gets a
bit<00:00:45.789> messy<00:00:46.049> squeeze<00:00:47.049> some<00:00:47.229> glue<00:00:47.409> on<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.589> q-tip

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
supposed to be natural acts but I

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.789 
supposed to be natural acts but I
personally<00:04:04.510> find<00:04:04.900> them<00:04:05.049> super<00:04:05.409> long<00:04:05.590> and

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
personally find them super long and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.250 
personally find them super long and
quite<00:04:06.129> dramatic<00:04:06.760> at<00:04:07.239> most<00:04:07.479> ankles<00:04:07.959> they<00:04:08.109> look

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
quite dramatic at most ankles they look

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.890 
quite dramatic at most ankles they look
just<00:04:08.470> awesome<00:04:08.889> but<00:04:09.699> I<00:04:09.729> think<00:04:09.970> my<00:04:10.239> eyes<00:04:10.540> look

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
just awesome but I think my eyes look

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.210 
just awesome but I think my eyes look
better<00:04:11.109> when<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.470> lashes<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:11.949> inner

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
better when the lashes in the inner

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.490 
better when the lashes in the inner
corners<00:04:12.819> are<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> bit<00:04:13.209> shorter<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.439> I

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
corners are a bit shorter so I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.199 
corners are a bit shorter so I
definitely<00:04:14.650> prefer<00:04:15.129> lashes<00:04:15.699> that<00:04:15.729> get<00:04:16.030> much

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
definitely prefer lashes that get much
