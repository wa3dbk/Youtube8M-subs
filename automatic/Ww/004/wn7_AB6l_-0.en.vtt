00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:17.460
 now to finish we could not stop talking about him because if elected 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.659
 you have no concept and the microphone 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.519
 How are we going to talk about our messages? 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.360
 for the information 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.770
 I produce programs that literally make art 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.289
 the presenter 6 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.170
 the most famous companion of the speakers as I 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.670
 our friend 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 microphone 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.570
 the microphone 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 you know it's here on my desk is the microphone with the wire 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.290
 this wired microphone he has 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.210
 here at his base 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 call them deny 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100
 have the cable to connect 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.420
 and off 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 For easy custody 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 now let's learn how to regulate each equipment is starting with a 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.920
 microphone 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.230
 I trust 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.690
 at the time we 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 here you can see that the channels that are 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.100
 that is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.590
 then everyone in the middle 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 we have here the effect zero balance in the middle 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.490
 And I asked, so let's get a good name down here. 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.410
 what would be the best regulation 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.740
 to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 wireless microphones let's start by the good relationship 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 agrarian mean acute 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.450
 but we fit the microphone up here 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.659
 on the wired microphone we'll regulate then quotes infront will put a 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.160
 a little over a year 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.420
 to the right 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 the middle we put in the middle 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.280
 The serious auto leaves us 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.410
 in the middle too 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.340
 this personal regulation may vary 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.189
 depending on the person if the person has a very serious voice for example 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.409
 so there 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
 a little more sharp 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.349
 if the person has a voice at the end 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.619
 so we can leave it in the middle 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.609
 but as standard 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.969
 hence I think the pattern works because after all who is going to mess 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.919
 with equipment the child then everyone uses that standard of 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.509
 put the approached a little bit more to the right in the position that they are 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.049
 seeing here on my finger 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.689
 and the other medium buttons it should come 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.420
 we leave in the middle 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.569
 OK 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.710
 the other effect buttons will be zeroed 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.700
 and occupy 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.489
 would be the balance getting mean 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.269
 now the key question 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.570
 What would be the best moment? 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.180
 So you can turn the microphone on and do the programs anyway. 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.229
 the volume i of the microphone with the wire we use until 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.249
 5 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.140
 that is 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.140
 we use almost all the volume and channel 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.819
 then at the warm-up time 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.129
 well this new mole that we come back to aim to turn on the microphone I trust 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.930
 now let's see how it regulates the wireless microphone 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:42.409
 see how the wireless handset modulation of the mean age acute it 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.779
 it is similar 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.629
 with wired microphone 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.550
 so let's see that I put on a little high again 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.550
 to the right a little sharply to the right 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.449
 no 3d # 4 as already 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.239
 put it here for you 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.709
 the middle is in the middle the grave is in the middle 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.549
 the effects are 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.219
 generally 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.730
 opa that would be the balance he will be in the middle also only that there in a 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:16.149
 detail the helinho wireless microphone already comes with some power 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.519
 they were already pricing 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.530
 so he does not need itatuba man 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.780
 it is not common to make the speech work 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.120
 so we set the default 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.710
 ef 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.830
 the wireless microphone 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.760
 etc. at most 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 until the 20th 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:43.280
 or practically in the middle of the freight 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.020
 I'm male
