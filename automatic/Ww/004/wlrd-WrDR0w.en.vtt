00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.580
 little puzzles tutorial 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.259
 Today it's about having a door 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.540
 can open with two switches 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.120
 I'll see myself like that now 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 works and which build equal 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 This door function with two switches 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.180
 I'm doing this step down 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 So the switch below and the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 switch santen 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 the door opens, I do everybody 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 switch high asks her to turn it on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 make it back up again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.099
 the door too too I explain it like 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.280
 that works and then i need 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.690
 that right here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 this switch result you change 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 Graf in london the deal makes it clear 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.829
 is a signal here and there here 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.780
 the website of comparators is above 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.219
 can be interrupted that is if 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 I now turn a switch 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.440
 Etk off to the digital magical these 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.440
 website down the door opens 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 ok if this one is down here you can see 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 here is no wonder and can 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 Now I have to be interrupted 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.540
 once the switch again under 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 40 here I have two amplifiers 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 made for the route to this number 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.280
 to steer the right door and gate 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 this way can be any size i like 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.579
 now do some all again 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 and then I'll build that first 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.299
 we would need a small room where the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.140
 Switches are housed 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.140
 that once here 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.460
 that may be quite easy now and once 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 Here, I continue to come here 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 So here comes the way for the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.549
 conversion and become complete so 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.939
 now comes the way operator 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:05.369
 We would have had conversion and we would have 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.549
 We build people now and then directly 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.649
 the comparators through the website 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:15.690
 or this blog here with the factors 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.340
 up here the broken cable has to be laid 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.630
 Otherwise you can have this white torch 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.310
 so do not disable the compart here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.079
 connected and various torches will 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 very important to make it that 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:44.819
 easier to say later comes that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 super easy and once with 1 2 the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.670
 Of course, the signal has to be the same as every one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.209
 iron door to be down here 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.200
 that does not work now comes here 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.200
 a little bit store.de another door 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:13.380
 and now we test if it works 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:18.419
 down, down on the top to after more so 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.489
 too i hope the tutorial is that 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.180
 is pretty easy under so easy 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.410
 please recreate a hope so 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.970
 hopefully a positive comment 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.950
 leave and subscribe 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.310
 if you missed if you main channel 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.980
 and I should continue my own 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.560
 website www.vox.de a tutorial so 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.329
 with total.com 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.329
 until next time bye
