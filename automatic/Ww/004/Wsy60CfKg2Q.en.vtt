when<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.800> look<00:00:05.160> at<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.880> biology<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:07.760> pleasure

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
when you look at the biology of pleasure

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.829 
when you look at the biology of pleasure
centers<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.570> brain<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.530> look<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:11.280> how

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
centers in the brain and you look at how

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.210 
centers in the brain and you look at how
it<00:00:12.839> is<00:00:12.990> influenced<00:00:13.769> by<00:00:14.059> genetics<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.509> by

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
it is influenced by genetics and by

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.560 
it is influenced by genetics and by
epigenetic<00:00:17.220> factors<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:18.060> maternal

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
in control that we have absolute choice

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.580 
in control that we have absolute choice
in<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.340> things<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.329> notion<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.170> there

in all things and the notion that there

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
in all things and the notion that there
are<00:01:13.829> strong<00:01:15.259> subconscious<00:01:16.259> currents<00:01:17.509> pushing

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
are strong subconscious currents pushing

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
are strong subconscious currents pushing
and<00:01:18.810> pulling<00:01:19.469> our<00:01:19.950> behavior<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.710> scary<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and pulling our behavior is scary and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.660 
and pulling our behavior is scary and
when<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.719> face<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.890> biology

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

when you have to face up to the biology
of<00:01:26.700> addiction<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:27.899> have<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.409> face<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.039> the

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
of addiction you have to face up to the

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.450 
of addiction you have to face up to the
existence<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:32.030> those<00:01:33.030> strong<00:01:34.460> subconscious

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
existence of those strong subconscious

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.709 
existence of those strong subconscious
currents<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.579> fear<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.450> in

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
currents and I think the fear of that in

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.289 
currents and I think the fear of that in
ourselves<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.030> are

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ourselves I think when we are

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.349 
ourselves I think when we are
contemptuous<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.500> addicts<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> say<00:01:44.579> no<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
contemptuous of addicts and say no you

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.700 
contemptuous of addicts and say no you
don't<00:01:45.539> have<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.719> disease<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> will

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
don't have a disease you're just a will
