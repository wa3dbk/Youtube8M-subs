 streets and the houses and the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 patrimonies that were so affected today 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.960
 the governor will have to decide how 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.759
 support these people and we know that they are a 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 governor of the warm especially of 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.440

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.940
 today we have to save we know of two 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.399
 victims right now we do not know if they are 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.540
 clearly from this to what is attributed to him 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.700
 but if we already have two victims 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.280
 is correct so just received a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.760
 body a body of a person who is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.110
 being identified and fully 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.160
 looking for the reasons the causes of the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 death 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.920
 you have been notified of the damages 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.260
 that is, it is responsible to estimate a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.090
 some amount today we talk more than 200 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.490
 cases that have been disrupted by this 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.590
 for this situation either in greater or 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.260
 lower grade but they are like 200 houses of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 those that are affected today 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.520
 a call to all citizens 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.310
 I think that now more than coming is 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.840
 contribute water supplies food 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.160
 you cover everything that someone can 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.440
 need after an event like 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 these equally the government of the people 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.090
 makes the call very attentive and above all 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.370
 looking in their hearts and that about 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 all see that today they occupy these feelings 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.880
 some day we will occupy then 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.200

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.630
