00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
when I hobby set about designing their

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
when I hobby set about designing their
brand-new<00:00:15.299> fridge/freezer<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.590> ask<00:00:16.949> the

results come flooding in people said

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.310 
results come flooding in people said
that<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:23.910> were<00:00:23.970> too<00:00:24.269> heavy<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.840> drew<00:00:25.109> too

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that they were too heavy they drew too

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
that they were too heavy they drew too
much<00:00:25.529> power<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.310> were<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:26.730> difficult<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
much power they were really difficult to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
much power they were really difficult to
clean<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:28.050> had<00:00:28.199> dodgy<00:00:28.470> dials<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.460> sorts<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
clean they had dodgy dials all sorts of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.420 
clean they had dodgy dials all sorts of
problems<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.720> I'll<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.560> talking<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
problems so I'll be talking all that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.340 
problems so I'll be talking all that
information<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.780> tried<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> build<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
information and they tried to build the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.860 
information and they tried to build the
perfect<00:00:34.530> fridge<00:00:34.950> okay<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:35.969> let's<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.690> how

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
perfect fridge okay so let's see how

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
perfect fridge okay so let's see how
they've<00:00:37.050> done<00:00:37.129> first<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> fridge<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they've done first of all this fridge is

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.940 
they've done first of all this fridge is
designed<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> steel<00:00:40.140> chassis<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.800> it's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
designed on a steel chassis so it's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
designed on a steel chassis so it's
super<00:00:41.280> strong<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.090> they've<00:00:42.210> used

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
super strong but they've used

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
super strong but they've used
polyurethane<00:00:43.260> panels<00:00:43.800> making<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
polyurethane panels making it in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
polyurethane panels making it in
lightweight<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> break

lightweight so you're not going to break

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
lightweight so you're not going to break
your<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> try<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.879> lift<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
your back when you try and lift it in

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
your back when you try and lift it in
the<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.079> fall<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.469> Drive<00:00:49.879> secondly

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it's got a removable lid so if you've

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's got a removable lid so if you've
got<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> smaller<00:00:53.309> four-wheel<00:00:53.730> drive<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
got a smaller four-wheel drive when you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
got a smaller four-wheel drive when you
lift<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.110> lit<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.739> won't<00:00:56.039> hit<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> roof

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
lift that lit up you won't hit the roof

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
lift that lit up you won't hit the roof
it'll<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.140> stress<00:00:58.680> on

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it'll really put very little stress on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
it'll really put very little stress on
your<00:00:58.980> battery<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.489> when<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> battery

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
your battery and when the battery

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
your battery and when the battery
actually<00:01:00.780> gets<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> ten<00:01:01.680> point<00:01:01.949> four

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually gets down to ten point four

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.399 
actually gets down to ten point four
volts<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.059> fridge<00:01:03.359> will<00:01:03.539> actually<00:01:03.899> cut<00:01:04.199> out

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
volts the fridge will actually cut out

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
volts the fridge will actually cut out
so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> still<00:01:05.339> gives<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.119> of

so it still gives you a little bit of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
so it still gives you a little bit of
gas<00:01:06.390> left<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.229> power<00:01:07.470> plant<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.310> the

press the buttons for about three

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
one of my favorites is its clean ability

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.719 
one of my favorites is its clean ability
this<00:01:27.330> fridge<00:01:27.689> has<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.080> integrated<00:01:28.530> element<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
this fridge has an integrated element so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.850 
this fridge has an integrated element so
that<00:01:29.939> means<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:30.689> no<00:01:30.869> gaps<00:01:31.259> between<00:01:31.530> the

element<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> fridge<00:01:32.850> itself<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
element and the fridge itself so you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870

is very different and it is well worth

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.740 
is very different and it is well worth
looking<00:02:09.130> at<00:02:09.250> because<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.060> certainly<00:02:10.479> one

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
looking at because this is certainly one

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.920 
looking at because this is certainly one
