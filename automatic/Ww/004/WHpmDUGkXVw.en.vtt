this door before the raid comes out
because<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> feeling<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.900> gonna

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
because I have a feeling that it's gonna

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.440 
because I have a feeling that it's gonna
do<00:02:49.349> something<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.489> hole<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> floor

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
do something with this hole in the floor

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.289 
do something with this hole in the floor
in<00:02:51.750> front<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.379> door<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.799> these<00:02:53.730> companion

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.990 
in front of the door and these companion
cubes<00:02:54.629> so<00:02:55.530> I'm<00:02:55.590> pretty<00:02:55.829> sure<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.819> could

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
cubes so I'm pretty sure that we could

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.250 
cubes so I'm pretty sure that we could
figure<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.690> together<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:59.430> could<00:02:59.549> do<00:02:59.760> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260
