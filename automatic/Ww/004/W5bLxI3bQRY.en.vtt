00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.399
 hello everyone according to title returns 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.399
 for a small role 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.449
 so if you follow me on instagram 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.160
 you must have seen that I went a 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:19.640
 beauty ambassador meeting 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.230
 for audio and so inevitably when I 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.300
 go to audio I always fall for 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.539
 a few tips and tricks as I said 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.820
 but here it is the cave of ali baba 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.880
 cccm it's a treasury thing ya full 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.890
 of things in the audio f difficult to 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.660
 do not crack but you know it 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.859
 I always try to be reasonable and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.539
 not to take either ten thousand 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.890
 things that I will not use so 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.460
 I decided to take only things 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.149
 useful to start with a new object 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.100
 of torture 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.389
 yes because that's just very very 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.370
 essential 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:53.089
 then you also know if you 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.620
 follow sure on youtube point here actually 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.940
 I made you a little video there 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.499
 not long ago regarding the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.829
 demonstration of the small suckers 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.760
 cell or for cellulite and I 'm 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.430
 I said I was going to try another 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 technical because I'm a tester 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 in the suburbs is a fact I took 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.190
 this little gadget that already made me 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 the eye the last time actually when 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.170
 I was gone and it's a little bit of 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.450
 simply massage that is supposed 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.250
 to be anti-cellulite and to have it already 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.600
 used multiple times then not 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.070
 enough to tell you that it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.510
 walk on the dimples but 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 enough to tell you that it does 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 badly then I get on my hand it hurts 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.320
 it's bearable but you know 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.580
 the kind of pain or we say a goal 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.050
 like it hurts it should make 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.210
 the effect like when we make the effect 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.070
 sucker with the cell where we have a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.020
 little sensation at once hurting 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.400
 and at the same time that makes pleasure between 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.320
 quotation marks in the center its meaning 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.250
 creative 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.050
 so that's the same thing it's at 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.150
 say that you will spend it on your 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.800
 thighs where you want and especially 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.270
 when you do that you have 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.950
 the impression that it's just innocuous and 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.020
 in fact when you stop the pain 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 back and you say it hurts 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.620
 so be careful not to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.909
 cause bruises because I have 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.890
 had to insist a little too much and I believe that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.150
 on one side I have a little blue to whom 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 is out it must be because of that 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.600
 so go in moderation but I think 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.979
 only to activate the circulation 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.709
 pain felt it works very very 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.510
 well then the same you must have seen 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.540
 on instagram that I was walking my 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.170
 phone in something like that so that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.970
 in fact it's a tactile pocket 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.020
 waterproof for smartphones so 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 be careful the waterproof side yes for 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.630
 splashing 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.520
 but it's not meant to take them 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 photos under the water 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.910
 okay it's really an object of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.930
 protection so I think that's 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.180
 could save a message chat I think 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.069
 that it could save a phone 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.019
 accidental drowning ie 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.010
 you are by the pool your 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.319
 cover falls into the water you the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.600
 recover quickly and I think very 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.850
 sincerely that the phone would not 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.319
 no money but that's not done 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.790
 to voluntarily put in 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.440
 water because there I think that as and when 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.750
 as the uses grow 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.180
 system so that has two pressures and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.760
 when you unfold who has three 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.650
 closures slide 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.330
 I still think that as and when 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.160
 measure of use it needs more or 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.230
 least a little bit to fall away father of 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.700
 sealing so we see your place I 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.380
 would not put in the water because 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.110
 that it's still marked waterproof 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.130
 but not for divers or is it 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.650
 that it is marked whereas here you are 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.780
 not immersed in the water anyway not 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.400
 immersed in water but then mud 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.420
 on that works very very well I was 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.850
 it's by the pool 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.670
 nothing to say if you saw my routine 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.640
 summer mornings you must have glimpse 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.130
 two of the other products of this fact 4 5 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.769
 2 of the other products that I also have 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.950
 wasteland and audio it's about my sponge 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.900
 2nd ci lean company a sponge 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.650
 natural to the face so that has a 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.150
 small effect very very very slightly 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.640
 erasing then really very very light 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.049
 but here it is seydou but it cleans 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.359
 really very very good skin and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.340
 especially I love this feeling on the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.620
 face especially in summer and then that's it 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 comes from the sea it's stop the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.250
 products that I love so watch out there 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.010
 be aware that natural sponges 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.350
 are supposed to be endangered 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.450
 but precisely the society that makes the one 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 who came this one is a society that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.739
 is very very com 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 is concerned with this problem of 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.340
 disappearance of natural sponges and which 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.989
 makes sure to promote their 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.210
 wholesale reproduction they make a small 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.169
 little breeding to avoid precisely 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.760
 disappearance 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.050
 this also explains why the price 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.389
 is quite expensive because this sponge 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.070
 you still 19 euros 90 but that's it 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.169
 I think it's better to buy a 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.090
 natural sponge to a society that makes 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.160
 any time that makes every effort to 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 save a little bit the species rather 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.860
 that buy them cheap on ebay or 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.510
 any site 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.070
 at a seller who has strictly 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.990
 nothing to do that soon his little 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.030
 sponges be very very very little 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.350
 many so here and so you 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.570
 have also seen it in the video 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.919
 I use this sponge with my little one 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.139
 soap with donkey milk 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.600
 so I pray them in nature scents 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.270
 there are many other fragrances in the 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.690
 mark anne essence then it's ti 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.220
 know there they cut 5 euros 90 and 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.410
 here I am told that for the face 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.880
 it would be just perfect if recognized as 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.610
 best full of very very good 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.560
 virtues so the test so that was all 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.090
 for the products that I bought myself and 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.669
 as usual I left with 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.410
 some small gifts to test between 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.960
 others because they know that I am 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.190
 fan fan fan of the brand durance but 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.180
 really it's a favorite for me 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.710
 this brand 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.560
 so I was lucky to leave with 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.729
 the shower gel scented with white jasmine 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.430
 and it really feels very very very very 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.919
 good is how to say fleury would 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.530
 really good scents too 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.229
 because sl is it's my smell 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.780
 pampered at durance a little soap 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.460
 scented to the summer fidh if you do not 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.010
 not felt the products during his ficd 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.979
 was honestly the court went 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.300
 feel they have a site too 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.849
 it's a smell that's me 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.580
 personally it's my favorite author 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.349
 is also a small batch of soap 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.060
 of guests then mini soaps very 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.599
 convenient for the trip and there they are 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.710
 with white lilies and it smells good shrink but 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.210
 in fact I wonder what does not feel 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.500
 flinched during this so far I 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.949
 believe that not a single smell that I have 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.320
 not liked 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.610
 so here I come so at the end of this 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.770
 hall i hope this little video 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.570
 you will have liked it if you too have 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.860
 already tested some of the products that I 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.510
 showed you there especially do not hesitate 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.139
 to tell us all this in the 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.819
 comments under the video as dhabi 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.129
 and then me waiting for a next 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.789
 video I can see a big kiss he says 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.150
 at the time 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.150
 ciao
