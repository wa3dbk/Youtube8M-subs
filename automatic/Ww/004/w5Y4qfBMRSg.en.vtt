even greater cost to the environment

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.009 
even greater cost to the environment
that's<00:02:08.340> why<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> measure<00:02:09.149> our<00:02:09.509> carbon

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
that's why I have to measure our carbon

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.619 
that's why I have to measure our carbon

footprint<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.440> way<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.739> measure<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.310> much

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489

okay I understand this is serious stuff
but<00:02:42.750> how<00:02:42.930> does<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.170> tie<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.530> with<00:02:43.799> food

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
