Voldemort and Harry because in the
original<00:02:33.980> drafts<00:02:34.660> they<00:02:35.660> were<00:02:35.720> very<00:02:35.810> similar

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
original drafts they were very similar

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.839 
original drafts they were very similar
to<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.530> we<00:02:36.739> had<00:02:36.860> in<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.099> book<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.760> she

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
to what we had in the book when she

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.100 
to what we had in the book when she
takes<00:02:38.030> place<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.420> Great<00:02:38.599> Hall<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
takes place in the Great Hall and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.710 
takes place in the Great Hall and
Voldemort<00:02:39.650> circles<00:02:40.010> Harry<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.760> felt<00:02:41.630> we

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
Voldemort circles Harry and I felt we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.500 
Voldemort circles Harry and I felt we
needed<00:02:41.750> something<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.470> bit<00:02:42.590> more<00:02:43.180> personal<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
needed something a bit more personal and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.900 
needed something a bit more personal and
visceral<00:02:45.109> between<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.590> two<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.769> them<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.880> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
visceral between the two of them so I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.910 
visceral between the two of them so I
encourage<00:02:47.120> Steve<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:48.230> off<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.590> think

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
encourage Steve to go off and think

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.670 
encourage Steve to go off and think
about<00:02:49.250> ways<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:49.880> which<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.450> could<00:02:50.630> have<00:02:51.380> time

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
about ways in which we could have time

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.199 
about ways in which we could have time
with<00:02:51.859> Voldemort<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.370> Harry<00:02:52.670> away<00:02:52.940> from

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
with Voldemort and Harry away from

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.930 
with Voldemort and Harry away from
everybody<00:02:53.450> else<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:55.250> final

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
everybody else so that that final

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.250 
everybody else so that that final
confrontation<00:02:56.299> could<00:02:56.870> be<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.019> bit<00:02:57.140> more

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
confrontation could be a bit more

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:09.830 
confrontation could be a bit more
personal<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:57.920> intense<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.390> one

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.260
