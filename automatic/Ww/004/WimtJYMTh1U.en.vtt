00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.939
 the groups follow small kitchen 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.160
 big dreams we have just so second 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.640
 times a model made that first 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.180
 once is gone and that has pretty 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.079
 Let's make a few more 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.809
 galactic thunder cucumbers presentation 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.760
 as a drink from the book hitchhiker 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.280
 by the galaxis should actually 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.400
 should be known to everyone 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.440
 really would have to occur so who 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.440
 it does not know who let that and part 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.440
 it shows you already and small 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.850
 So what do we need with unhealthy 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.810
 but today this is what actually 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.489
 we do not have a champagne half-year either 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.009
 then you can do a little bit 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.680
 comment on what you hate so much from here 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.729
 In any case we need the sec 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.640
 twelve centimeters then we have the gin 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.960
 of it made two centiliters of that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 blue curacao trees also have two centiliters 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.700
 of the tequila silver is important because of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.190
 the fr that it's not the cold why 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.650
 We also have two centiliters 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.130
 as of the vodka so you can tell 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.560
 that is, that is actually all that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.900
 because of liquid more or less in it 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.010
 However, that is unhealthy we are 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.650
 of course, have something healthy 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.570
 So here's his lemon for everyone 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.340
 health fanatic with vitamins and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.650
 so we have everything in it that is not so 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:58.270
 that you are here now just somehow 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:58.270
 So what first 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:16.000
 how many centimeters but differently graf 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:23.080
 I first hit the tor 5 to 10 cm something 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 ice so that two short pants 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.300
 centimeter 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:45.220
 we should do that to two centiliters 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:50.500
 now not full of the job for those 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.420
 put in color that the bartender that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 So things can get mixed up 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.470
 ingredients here certainly but I have it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.270
 but has already ordered 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.300
 ingredient list with given and then 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.250
 it was funny animal 1 do this 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.840
 days list is then boring too 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.790
 So if you have the ingredient list 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:18.520
 so we will 'unravel when 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:21.220
 the ingredients we are again today times 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.760
 that he did not have to have everything 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.000
 let know so the train has one must 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.010
 yes also knows exactly the combination 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.570
 There's no such thing as one 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.989
 bit of alcohol here as wonderful 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.989
 to have 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:58.120
 but so the harder answers 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:58.120
 things in each case two centimeters high 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.680
 constantly raise the boundaries again 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.060
 shot to have some rest and do it now 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:40.570
 small splash of lemon, too , almost 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:42.340
 behind again comes only once maybe 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.830
 probably knew me with glass splinters 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:52.000
 which cost is so, and now only two 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:55.360
 but drink it for the people here 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:06.280
 the rent is still clear girls 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:08.590
 as they have created on a 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:17.650
 clean glass for the 12 10 o'clock with the 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:19.690
 star again dirt bit of purity that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.610
 should be twelve centimeters is known 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.610
 for digital now still mission 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.669
 that's guys p definition is so 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:50.120
 galactic donna donna was that 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.910
 team of fortuna with three pieces of 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.560
 ate dinner 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:58.210
 the white spot 4 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.210
 depending on how well you ate
