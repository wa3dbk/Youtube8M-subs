because at the end I don't feel very

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
because at the end I don't feel very
compelled<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.470> read<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> next<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
compelled to read the next one like I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.590 
compelled to read the next one like I
wish<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.090> longer

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
wish it was longer

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
wish it was longer
I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> cliffhanger<00:01:40.770> could<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.070> been

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I think the cliffhanger could have been

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
I think the cliffhanger could have been
better<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.299> wasn't<00:01:42.600> sure<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
better because I wasn't sure if it was a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
better because I wasn't sure if it was a
serious<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.430> book

lot of people were dead at different
points<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.170> then<00:02:21.409> they<00:02:21.980> weren't<00:02:22.489> dead

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
points and then they weren't dead

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.280 
points and then they weren't dead
there's<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.299> many<00:02:23.420> points<00:02:23.810> were<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.079> in

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
there's so many points were there in

there's so many points were there in
these<00:02:24.590> fighting<00:02:25.189> life<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.519> death<00:02:25.640> situation

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
these fighting life or death situation

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.580 
these fighting life or death situation
when<00:02:26.120> Sam<00:02:26.420> got<00:02:26.629> shot<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:27.019> like<00:02:29.049> but<00:02:30.049> he<00:02:30.260> lives

when Sam got shot was like but he lives

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.470 
when Sam got shot was like but he lives
and<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.340> two<00:02:31.519> weeks<00:02:31.730> later<00:02:31.909> he<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.150> standing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and in two weeks later he was standing

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.929 
and in two weeks later he was standing
up<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.810> stuff<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.590> they're<00:02:33.980> altered<00:02:34.549> but

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
up and stuff I know they're altered but

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.569 
up and stuff I know they're altered but
I<00:02:35.000> feel<00:02:35.359> like<00:02:35.900> that's<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.530> made<00:02:36.769> me<00:02:37.040> kind<00:02:37.459> of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
I feel like that's what made me kind of

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.089 
I feel like that's what made me kind of
at<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.970> end<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.299> book<00:02:38.650> because<00:02:39.650> there<00:02:39.980> are

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
at the end of the book because there are

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.039 
at the end of the book because there are
so<00:02:40.280> many<00:02:40.340> near-death<00:02:40.819> situations<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.750> no

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
so many near-death situations that no

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.610 
so many near-death situations that no
one<00:02:42.319> died<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.280> even<00:02:43.700> Anna<00:02:44.030> Anna<00:02:44.420> walked<00:02:45.170> right

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
one died and even Anna Anna walked right

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.520 
one died and even Anna Anna walked right
into<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.129> trap<00:02:46.510> basically<00:02:47.510> at<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:47.810> end<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.290> she

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
into a trap basically at the end but she

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.229 
into a trap basically at the end but she
ended<00:02:48.799> up<00:02:48.920> kicking<00:02:49.189> ass<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.700> getting<00:02:49.849> out<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
ended up kicking ass and getting out it

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.089 
ended up kicking ass and getting out it
just<00:02:50.269> seems<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:50.720> easy<00:02:50.750> how<00:02:51.470> she<00:02:51.530> kicked<00:02:51.919> ass

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
just seems so easy how she kicked ass

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.490 
just seems so easy how she kicked ass
and<00:02:52.280> god<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.459> didn't<00:02:52.909> take<00:02:53.120> time<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.959> was<00:02:54.349> like

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and god I didn't take time it was like

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.470 
and god I didn't take time it was like
boom<00:02:54.799> boom<00:02:54.829> boom<00:02:55.340> boom<00:02:55.639> there<00:02:55.970> was<00:02:56.060> no<00:02:56.209> point

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
boom boom boom boom there was no point

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.179 
boom boom boom boom there was no point
where<00:02:56.659> she<00:02:56.750> was<00:02:56.870> locked<00:02:57.019> in<00:02:57.169> a<00:02:57.260> cage<00:02:57.500> she'd

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
where she was locked in a cage she'd

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.069 
where she was locked in a cage she'd
just<00:02:58.579> been<00:02:58.760> hooked<00:02:59.000> up<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.269> bed<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.900> then

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
just been hooked up to that bed and then

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.050 
just been hooked up to that bed and then
she<00:03:00.109> attacked<00:03:00.500> Riley<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.519> came<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.909> after

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
she attacked Riley that came in after

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.789 
she attacked Riley that came in after
her<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.510> know<00:03:02.599> saying<00:03:02.900> everything<00:03:03.500> was<00:03:03.530> so

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
her you know saying everything was so

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.589 
her you know saying everything was so
easy<00:03:04.189> and<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:05.000> think<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.239> could<00:03:05.269> have<00:03:05.510> been

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
easy and I just think it could have been

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.599 
easy and I just think it could have been
a<00:03:05.659> little<00:03:05.930> more<00:03:06.260> difficult<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:07.310> if<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
a little more difficult and if that

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.670 
a little more difficult and if that
would<00:03:07.790> have<00:03:07.909> felt<00:03:08.239> more<00:03:08.510> realistic<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.349> TREB

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
would have felt more realistic and TREB
