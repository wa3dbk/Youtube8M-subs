00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
control stick that's your best bet for

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.340 
control stick that's your best bet for
that<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.480> you<00:02:09.480> hang<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> you're

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that because you hang on to it you're

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.410 
that because you hang on to it you're
just<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.740> spin<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.400> not<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.390> good

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
just going to spin out and not do good

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.920 
just going to spin out and not do good
at<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.980> also<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:15.150> you're<00:02:15.240> only<00:02:15.390> very

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
at all so also when you're only very

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.040 
at all so also when you're only very
inside<00:02:16.410> very<00:02:16.740> outside<00:02:17.130> track<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.750> way

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
inside very outside track you have way

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.440 
inside very outside track you have way
more<00:02:19.080> control<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.940> push<00:02:21.240> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
more control like you can push the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.330 
more control like you can push the
control<00:02:21.570> stick<00:02:22.050> harder<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.860> will<00:02:23.070> most

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
control stick harder and you will most

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340 
control stick harder and you will most
likely<00:02:23.610> not<00:02:23.940> spin<00:02:24.240> out<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.780> middle<00:02:25.080> tracks

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
likely not spin out if the middle tracks

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.460 
likely not spin out if the middle tracks
you<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.800> worry<00:02:26.070> about<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.990> was<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> very

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
you have to worry about this was a very

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.880 
you have to worry about this was a very
close<00:02:28.800> call<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.430> i<00:02:29.490> won<00:02:30.230> I'm<00:02:31.230> very<00:02:31.290> happy<00:02:31.860> for

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
close call but i won I'm very happy for

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.199 
close call but i won I'm very happy for
that<00:02:32.070> also<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.140> next<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> shy<00:02:38.610> guy<00:02:38.850> says

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
that also all right next is shy guy says

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.110 
that also all right next is shy guy says
we<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:39.810> love<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.430> now<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> pointed<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:41.940> out

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
we all love this now I pointed this out

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
we all love this now I pointed this out
in<00:02:42.270> one<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.540> boards<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> go

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
in one of my boards but I'm going to go

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370 
in one of my boards but I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> point<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.880> out<00:02:44.970> again<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:46.200> can

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
ahead and point it out again you can

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.710 
ahead and point it out again you can
almost<00:02:46.650> predict<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.970> shy<00:02:48.239> guy<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.480> gonna

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
almost predict when shy guy is gonna

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.590 
almost predict when shy guy is gonna
shake<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.230> out<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.459> notice<00:02:50.790> lakitu<00:02:51.239> is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
shake you out if you notice lakitu is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.320 
shake you out if you notice lakitu is
going<00:02:51.900> across<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.500> top<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:52.980> screen<00:02:53.330> now

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
going across the top of the screen now

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.050 
going across the top of the screen now
if<00:02:54.630> he<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.140> shy<00:02:56.100> guy<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.400> gonna<00:02:56.520> hold<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.850> one

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
if he if shy guy is gonna hold up one

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.360 
if he if shy guy is gonna hold up one
flag<00:02:57.330> he'll<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:57.930> by<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.560> fast<00:02:58.950> especially

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
flag he'll go by really fast especially

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.090 
flag he'll go by really fast especially
as<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.180> game<00:03:00.360> progresses<00:03:00.930> Pete<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.130> suck<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
as the game progresses Pete you suck and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.410 
as the game progresses Pete you suck and
if<00:03:05.100> naughty<00:03:05.400> things<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.850> gonna<00:03:05.940> fake<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.390> out

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
if naughty things are gonna fake you out

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.510 
if naughty things are gonna fake you out
lakitu<00:03:07.200> will<00:03:07.470> go<00:03:07.620> by<00:03:07.800> really<00:03:07.980> slowly<00:03:09.170> um<00:03:10.520> so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
lakitu will go by really slowly um so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240 
lakitu will go by really slowly um so
just<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.110> way<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.320> predict<00:03:13.890> what's

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
just like it's a way to predict what's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.940 
just like it's a way to predict what's
gonna<00:03:14.459> happen<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.959> right<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.830> is

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
gonna happen like right there like to is

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.510 
gonna happen like right there like to is
a<00:03:16.980> little<00:03:17.220> slower<00:03:17.550> once<00:03:18.360> again<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:20.130> there<00:03:20.400> it

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
a little slower once again and there it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.199 
a little slower once again and there it
was<00:03:20.580> fast<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.570> can<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:21.989> what<00:03:22.110> I'm<00:03:22.230> saying

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
was fast so you can see what I'm saying

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.850 
was fast so you can see what I'm saying
so<00:03:24.209> that's<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.540> way<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.750> keep<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.380> mind<00:03:25.590> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
so that's a way to keep that in mind and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.890 
so that's a way to keep that in mind and
you<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.250> until<00:03:26.580> lack<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.180> off<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.570> screen

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you have until lack to is off the screen

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.940 
you have until lack to is off the screen
to<00:03:28.080> choose<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> flag<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:30.320> yeah<00:03:31.320> when<00:03:31.530> he<00:03:31.709> fakes

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
to choose a flag so yeah when he fakes

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.580 
to choose a flag so yeah when he fakes
you<00:03:32.130> out<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.730> time<00:03:33.060> don't<00:03:33.780> panic<00:03:34.260> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
you out you have time don't panic and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.110 
you out you have time don't panic and
like<00:03:34.680> pick<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.580> flag<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.660> me

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
like pick a flag out of me

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.380 
like pick a flag out of me
just<00:03:37.840> panicking<00:03:38.590> suddenly<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:40.180> know<00:03:40.330> you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
just panicking suddenly you know you

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.699 
just panicking suddenly you know you
should<00:03:40.810> be<00:03:40.900> fine<00:03:41.230> if<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:41.650> follow<00:03:42.010> that

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
should be fine if you just follow that

now<00:03:52.510> we<00:03:52.569> have<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.650> game<00:03:53.890> with<00:03:54.220> probably<00:03:54.879> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
now we have the game with probably the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.910 
now we have the game with probably the
worst<00:03:55.329> mechanics<00:03:56.159> of<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:58.209> in<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.780> think<00:03:59.769> this

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
worst mechanics of like in I think this

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.589 
worst mechanics of like in I think this
game<00:04:00.099> has<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.340> worst<00:04:00.610> mechanics<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.269> mario

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
game has the worst mechanics of mario

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.009 
game has the worst mechanics of mario
party<00:04:01.840> 2<00:04:02.110> like<00:04:02.349> literally<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:04.360> have<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.870> kind

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
party 2 like literally you have to kind

party 2 like literally you have to kind
of<00:04:05.140> predict<00:04:05.650> when<00:04:06.099> Chain<00:04:06.459> Chomp<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.909> going<00:04:07.060> to

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
of predict when Chain Chomp is going to

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.240 
of predict when Chain Chomp is going to
wake<00:04:07.299> up<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.810> usually<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.409> on<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.680> second

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
wake up and usually it's on the second

wake up and usually it's on the second
bubble<00:04:09.700> he<00:04:10.030> makes<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:11.319> totally<00:04:11.680> should

bubble he makes and I totally should

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640 
bubble he makes and I totally should
have<00:04:12.459> gotten<00:04:12.819> that<00:04:12.970> right<00:04:13.299> there<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.900> should

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
have gotten that right there I should

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.860

controls reddish are really unique

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.990
