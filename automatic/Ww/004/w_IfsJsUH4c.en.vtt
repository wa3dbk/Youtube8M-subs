this<00:04:57.979> is<00:04:58.130> often<00:04:58.460> made<00:04:58.640> easier<00:04:59.120> by<00:04:59.600> first

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
this is often made easier by first

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.870 
this is often made easier by first
folding<00:05:00.200> up<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.590> large<00:05:00.860> section<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.580> door

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
folding up a large section of the door

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.909 
folding up a large section of the door
and<00:05:02.150> then<00:05:02.660> folding<00:05:03.080> this<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.380> two<00:05:03.590> halves

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
and then folding this in two halves

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.130 
and then folding this in two halves
again<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.760> make<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.150> roll<00:05:05.360> more<00:05:05.570> rigid<00:05:06.050> and

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
again to make the roll more rigid and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.100 
again to make the roll more rigid and
easier<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.040> handle<00:05:07.430> once<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.450> roll<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.840> about

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
easier to handle once the roll is about

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.680 
easier to handle once the roll is about
500<00:05:09.800> millimeters<00:05:10.310> from<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.550> top<00:05:10.790> another

trick is to flip it and roll the
