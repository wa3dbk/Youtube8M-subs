it's<00:02:59.110> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.440> do<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.799> and<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.040> going<00:03:00.160> to

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
it's going to do that and it's going to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's going to do that and it's going to
starve<00:03:00.670> itself<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.390> order<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.780> see<00:03:01.959> results

out more and they get this thought stuck

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.559 
out more and they get this thought stuck
in<00:04:10.379> their<00:04:10.650> head<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.819> they<00:04:12.120> keep<00:04:12.150> trying

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
in their head that if they keep trying

in their head that if they keep trying
to<00:04:12.750> stay<00:04:13.080> lean<00:04:13.470> they're<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.159> look<00:04:14.250> as

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
to stay lean they're going to look as

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.759 
to stay lean they're going to look as
ripped<00:04:14.760> as<00:04:14.849> they<00:04:15.000> used<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.900> realistically

ripped as they used to but realistically
the<00:04:17.010> problem<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.699> they're<00:04:17.970> killing

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
the problem is is that they're killing

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.449 
the problem is is that they're killing
off<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.449> muscle<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.229> their<00:04:19.500> bodies<00:04:19.919> by<00:04:20.100> trying

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
off the muscle in their bodies by trying

off the muscle in their bodies by trying
to<00:04:20.639> stay<00:04:20.850> lean<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.329> they're<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:21.989> getting

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
to stay lean and they're not getting

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.930 
to stay lean and they're not getting
that<00:04:22.350> company<00:04:22.919> morn<00:04:23.100> then<00:04:23.280> they're<00:04:23.520> no<00:04:23.699> longer

spoke lean out however it's easy to go

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.469 
spoke lean out however it's easy to go
back<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.250> other<00:04:41.280> way<00:04:41.550> you're<00:04:41.940> not<00:04:42.240> going<00:04:42.419> to

be able to consistently stay lean and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.840 
be able to consistently stay lean and
add<00:04:45.030> on<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.360> bulk<00:04:45.840> at<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.710> same<00:04:47.039> time<00:04:47.490> in

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
add on that bulk at the same time in

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.490 
add on that bulk at the same time in
both<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.360> these<00:04:48.479> scenarios<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:49.169> see<00:04:49.350> people

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
both of these scenarios we see people

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.590 
both of these scenarios we see people
who<00:04:49.800> are<00:04:49.919> pushing<00:04:50.130> themselves<00:04:50.600> consistently

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
who are pushing themselves consistently

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.529

and<00:04:51.810> hard<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.550> thing<00:04:53.580> that's<00:04:53.910> also

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
and hard but the thing that's also

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.210 
and hard but the thing that's also
consistent<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.229> neither<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:55.919> them<00:04:56.130> are

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
consistent is neither one of them are

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.490 
consistent is neither one of them are
