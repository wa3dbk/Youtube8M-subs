for balance working right into the sides

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.790 
for balance working right into the sides
here<00:01:55.450> take<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> slight<00:01:56.870> section<00:01:57.320> from<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.620> back

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
here take a slight section from the back

a slight slanting forward section over
the<00:02:01.280> ear<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.060> front

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
the ear going to the front

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.050 
the ear going to the front
same<00:02:03.470> thing<00:02:03.860> 90<00:02:04.280> degrees<00:02:04.580> from<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.850> head

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
same thing 90 degrees from the head

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.350 
same thing 90 degrees from the head
shape<00:02:06.610> working<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.670> lot<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.910> deep<00:02:08.090> point

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
shape working a lot of deep point

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.280

that shape right into it this way by

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.699 
that shape right into it this way by
using<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.540> slanting<00:02:17.959> forward<00:02:18.290> sections

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
using the slanting forward sections

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.560 
using the slanting forward sections
you'll<00:02:19.250> be<00:02:19.400> creating<00:02:19.610> movement<00:02:20.150> working

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
you'll be creating movement working

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.530 
you'll be creating movement working
towards<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.110> face<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.970> give<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.150> kind

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
towards the face just to give that kind

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
towards the face just to give that kind
