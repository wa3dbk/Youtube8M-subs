really<00:00:55.110> micro<00:00:55.500> partition<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.579> fact<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
really micro partition and the fact that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
really micro partition and the fact that
you<00:00:57.000> spawn<00:00:57.329> inside<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you spawn inside of this one and the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.060 
you spawn inside of this one and the
other<00:00:58.920> seed<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.359> awesome<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
other seed is just pretty awesome and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
other seed is just pretty awesome and
this<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:02.969> big<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> last

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this one so and not as big as the last

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.910 
this one so and not as big as the last
one<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.750> she's<00:01:04.019> still<00:01:04.199> spun<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> cave<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
one but she's still spun in the cave and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
one but she's still spun in the cave and
it's<00:01:05.070> totally<00:01:05.280> closed<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:06.240> no<00:01:06.420> way

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's totally closed up there's no way

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.350 
it's totally closed up there's no way
out<00:01:06.780> unless<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> dig<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:07.830> out

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
out unless you know you dig your way out

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.490 
out unless you know you dig your way out
but<00:01:09.360> pretty<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.840> love<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> fact

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
but pretty much I just love the fact

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.450 
but pretty much I just love the fact
that<00:01:12.170> there<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.350> random<00:01:13.830> caves<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that there are these random caves I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.090 
that there are these random caves I
guess<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> could<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.330> T's<00:01:15.540> random

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
guess you could say or like T's random

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.730 
guess you could say or like T's random
and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.340> water<00:01:18.330> lyst<00:01:18.630> aquifers<00:01:19.290> inside<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and I like water lyst aquifers inside of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.080 
and I like water lyst aquifers inside of
my<00:01:19.799> mouth<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> put<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
my mouth I don't know how to put it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
my mouth I don't know how to put it
because<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.750> aquifers<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.530> deep<00:01:22.770> inside

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
because I know aquifers are deep inside

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
because I know aquifers are deep inside
you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> earth<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:24.240> deep<00:01:24.390> inside<00:01:24.600> there

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you know the earth not deep inside there

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
you know the earth not deep inside there
but<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.080> they're<00:01:25.439> pretty<00:01:25.590> deep<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
but like they're pretty deep in the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
but like they're pretty deep in the
crust<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.700> anyway<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.570> love<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> idea

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
know inside of the mouth and said it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
know inside of the mouth and said it
just<00:01:32.490> makes<00:01:32.610> me<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.090> oh<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:33.930> maybe

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

just makes me think like oh look maybe
freakin<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.070> bunch<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> mountains<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
freakin like a bunch of mountains and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
freakin like a bunch of mountains and
awesome<00:01:36.869> seeds<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.380> maybe<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.009> have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
awesome seeds we know maybe they have

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.499 
awesome seeds we know maybe they have
these<00:01:38.340> things<00:01:38.549> inside<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.479> just

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
these things inside of them to we just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.640 
these things inside of them to we just
never<00:01:39.720> explode<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> know

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
never explode them because we you know

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.109 
never explode them because we you know
we<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.060> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we don't see them and it's not like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.490 
we don't see them and it's not like
we're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> spend<00:01:42.630> our<00:01:42.720> time<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.229> inside

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
we're going to spend our time go inside

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.539 
we're going to spend our time go inside
of<00:01:43.590> mountains<00:01:43.920> we're<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> dig<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of mountains we're going to dig down and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.219 
of mountains we're going to dig down and
get<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> oars<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:45.990> cool

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
get the oars so I'm just it's just cool

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
get the oars so I'm just it's just cool
to<00:01:46.259> thinking<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> possibly<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.460> bunch<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to thinking that possibly a bunch of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.460 
to thinking that possibly a bunch of
cool<00:01:48.329> seeds<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> already<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.140> could

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
cool seeds that we already have could

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
cool seeds that we already have could
also<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.979> these<00:01:50.130> awesome<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.060> seed<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
also have these awesome you know seed I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
also have these awesome you know seed I
mean<00:01:52.200> cave<00:01:52.470> things<00:01:52.799> inside<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.430> i'm<00:01:54.210> not

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
mean cave things inside but i'm not

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.370 
mean cave things inside but i'm not
going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> show<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> guys<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> rest<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
going to show you guys the rest of the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.539 
going to show you guys the rest of the
sea<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.770> i<00:01:55.860> checked<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.219> earlier

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
sea because i checked it out earlier

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.709 
sea because i checked it out earlier
myself<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> easiest

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
myself and this is I think the easiest

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
myself and this is I think the easiest
way<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.530> pretty<00:01:59.159> much<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> rest<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
way to get out I pretty much the rest of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
way to get out I pretty much the rest of
the<00:01:59.729> seed<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.079> bunch<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the seed is just as it's a bunch of a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.300 
the seed is just as it's a bunch of a
snow<00:02:01.590> biome<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.369> like

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
snow biome that is also like

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.249 
snow biome that is also like
other<00:02:03.820> bottoms<00:02:04.149> as<00:02:04.240> well<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.720> lot<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.049> it's

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
other bottoms as well but a lot of it's

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.870 
other bottoms as well but a lot of it's
a<00:02:05.380> snow<00:02:05.530> biome<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:06.220> know<00:02:06.280> if<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.790> guys

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
a snow biome so I don't know if you guys

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.430 
a snow biome so I don't know if you guys
like<00:02:07.119> snow<00:02:07.299> biomes<00:02:07.689> if<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:07.960> dude<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.380> that's

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
like snow biomes if you dude and that's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.109 
like snow biomes if you dude and that's
you<00:02:08.619> know<00:02:08.679> that's<00:02:08.739> good<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.789> has<00:02:09.940> some

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
you know that's good for you it has some

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.570 
you know that's good for you it has some
decent<00:02:10.590> extreme<00:02:11.590> Hills<00:02:11.830> or<00:02:12.040> extreme<00:02:12.430> edge

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
decent extreme Hills or extreme edge

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.430 
decent extreme Hills or extreme edge
hills<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:13.900> you're<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> fan<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
hills so if you're if you're a fan of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.350 
hills so if you're if you're a fan of
those<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.250> guess<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.000> seat<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.330> you

much<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:23.110> highlighted<00:02:23.560> seed<00:02:23.769> right<00:02:23.980> here

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
much just highlighted seed right here

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.390 
much just highlighted seed right here
this<00:02:24.640> little<00:02:24.849> cave<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.680> rest<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.130> sea<00:02:27.280> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
this little cave the rest of the sea is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.130 
this little cave the rest of the sea is
pretty<00:02:27.550> nice<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.760> mean<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.030> has<00:02:28.150> some<00:02:28.420> funky

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
pretty nice I mean it has some funky

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
pretty nice I mean it has some funky
formations<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:29.980> along<00:02:30.400> with<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.670> know<00:02:30.790> some

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
formations as along with you know some

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.420 
formations as along with you know some
extreme<00:02:31.330> Heights<00:02:32.140> type<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.560> things<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.099> I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
extreme Heights type of things so I

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.000 
extreme Heights type of things so I
think<00:02:34.150> there's<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:34.540> water<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.900> also<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:35.890> well

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
think there's some water is also as well

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
think there's some water is also as well
on<00:02:36.130> some<00:02:36.280> sugar<00:02:37.180> cane<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.510> pretty<00:02:37.690> much<00:02:37.720> this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
on some sugar cane but pretty much this

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.449 
on some sugar cane but pretty much this
is<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.110> highlight<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.440> seed<00:02:38.650> hope<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> guys
