00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.800 
for some reason tower four still has
half<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.199> its<00:04:29.350> construction<00:04:29.740> elevators

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.470 

my<00:04:38.410> guess<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.919> it's<00:04:39.160> still<00:04:39.639> there<00:04:39.850> for<00:04:40.120> more

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
my guess is it's still there for more

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:51.980 
my guess is it's still there for more
internal<00:04:41.139> work<00:04:41.440> that's<00:04:42.340> being<00:04:42.520> done<00:04:42.639> for<00:04:43.000> now

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:00.780 

One<00:04:52.680> World<00:04:52.710> Trade<00:04:53.100> Center

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.960 

there's<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.450> big<00:05:01.810> gap<00:05:02.140> there<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:03.400> glass<00:05:03.670> needs

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
there's a big gap there the glass needs

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:31.050 
there's a big gap there the glass needs
to<00:05:04.060> be<00:05:04.150> filled<00:05:04.360> in

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.290 

hi<00:05:32.060> I'm<00:05:32.210> approaching<00:05:32.750> thames<00:05:33.020> street<00:05:34.300> here's

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
hi I'm approaching thames street here's

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.220 
hi I'm approaching thames street here's
a<00:05:35.420> look<00:05:35.630> at<00:05:35.810> tower<00:05:36.110> 3<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.860> Tyler<00:05:37.190> for

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.600 

uh<00:05:43.280> tower<00:05:44.280> 3<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.760> still<00:05:44.970> on<00:05:45.120> hold<00:05:46.520> that's<00:05:47.520> very

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
uh tower 3 is still on hold that's very

00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:00.999 
uh tower 3 is still on hold that's very
unfortunate

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.579 

tower<00:06:01.639> for<00:06:01.999> still<00:06:02.270> has<00:06:02.479> half<00:06:03.139> of<00:06:03.379> its

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
tower for still has half of its

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.700 
tower for still has half of its
construction<00:06:03.979> elevators<00:06:05.439> like<00:06:06.439> I<00:06:06.499> said<00:06:06.589> I

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
construction elevators like I said I

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.079 
construction elevators like I said I
would<00:06:06.949> have<00:06:07.039> to<00:06:07.159> guess<00:06:07.369> that<00:06:07.400> it's<00:06:07.699> still<00:06:07.849> for

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.089 
would have to guess that it's still for

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:14.870 
would have to guess that it's still for
remaining<00:06:08.419> internal<00:06:08.990> work

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:34.950 

there's<00:06:15.750> tower<00:06:17.510> 1g<00:06:18.510> tower<00:06:18.690> one<00:06:18.930> right<00:06:19.140> there
