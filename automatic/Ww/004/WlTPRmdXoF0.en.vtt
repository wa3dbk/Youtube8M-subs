00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hey guys 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.759
 Today I'll show you a little about how 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.590
 Does renting house work for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.990
 season in the united states 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.289
 helton and rolling in a home condo 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 closed called beautiful life and here goes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.830
 serve as an example for all 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.930
 people who want to rent a house in 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 united states and that has millions of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.869
 I'll try to take some of those doubts. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.869
 doubts of you 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 I'm going to show you this house with the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.650
 standard is a four bedroom house 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.980
 known as such a bludgeon I will not 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.680
 semi-detached house one house next to the other one 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.300
 house a little smaller is also good that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.850
 It's clear that in the United States 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.610
 there is also a rule inside a house 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.989
 four bedroom house it has release 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.280
 to accommodate up to ten people in the house 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.740
 or eight people two in each room 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.720
 two more people in the room is a little 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.759
 different from Brazil where you rent a 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.380
 and you do not have to discriminate 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.930
 number of people who will stay 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.150
 hosted here is not the way the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.940
 house insurance there is the release of 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.890
 rent a three - bedroom house to 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.979
 today people in a four-bedroom house 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.920
 even of people and so goes a house of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.320
 five bedrooms up to 12 people usually 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.040
 always two by four and two more 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.040
 people on saturday 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.890
 this is a logical standard kitchen for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.360
 The bigger the house the bigger kitchen will also 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 see that has microwave electric cooker 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.750
 it is not a gas stove as it is usually 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:22.519
 People are an act of using in Brazil. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:24.870
 and the oven dish washer and 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.260
 cutlery 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.000
 the houses she also totally 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.810
 furnished however that usually a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.860
 tourist needs in your stay 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.980
 All Dishes Cups Elections Cups 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.870
 Towels need not bring anything from the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.320
 Brazil, this is all already in the house. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.840
 including extra sheets and towels 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.239
 some need to change 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.280
 As I said regarding the towel sheet 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.019
 usually has a whooper in the main 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480
 home where they are all stored 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.840
 As I'm showing you, several 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.019
 towels and sheets and one more next door 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.239
 with more towels sheets too 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.590
 available for use during 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 Your trip 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.780
 many people when they want to rent 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.400
 home in the united states is very afraid 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.440
 cleaning of the organization 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.250
 op science is hired during its 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.400
 stay 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 you can hire the extra company a 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.349
 two ten as much as you want but the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.379
 stretch is duck proportionally to the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.659
 House size is parliament opinion 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.120
 I'm show I think the people who 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.909
 come that they are willing to stay 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.970
 staying at home needs to have a little 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.159
 minimum organization organization with 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.159
 a minimum of organization usually does not 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.739
 this need and cleaning area 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.379
 outside it is once every fortnight 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.879
 it may be necessary but everything in 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.489
 homes in the united states all very much 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.250
 practical the house she already has 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.859
 Kato washing in a washing machine 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.799
 Dryer air conditioning washing machine 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.760
 is central in every home then in all 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.590
 environments you will have more 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.569
 and you do not have to leave the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.700
 All house open to me. Where are you going? 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.109
 generate increase get more dirt on the house 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.269
 I'm going to stay closed with air conditioning. 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.880
 connected 24 hours 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.780
 This makes the washing machine much easier. 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.930
 plates 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.599
 You can use as many times as you want. 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.240
 the new dry clothes will not have either 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.970
 no increase in energy use 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.830
 extra that you guys will use this works 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.870
 here in the united states but finally 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 those who want 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.820
 it is usually impossible to connect it to the 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.580
 administration of the condominium 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.950
 usually receives this contract is for 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.340
 a fee this usually asks for a 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.169
 God before the two days before the cleaning 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.129
 Someone come and clean the house, that's 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.169
 done but usually I 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.449
 I do not recommend it that much 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.889
 done I see in the practice of some 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:10.539
 customers and friends who are staying 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:12.309
 that there is no such need with your a 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.159
 house in the united states 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.729
 you need to pay attention to the time of 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.159
 purchase 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.589
 the composition of the value will generally have 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.909
 the daily rate the longer it 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.979
 stay in the house 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.269
 the proportional value of the daily 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.779
 it is decreasing 

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:32.139
 in addition service fee the rate of 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:35.349
 taxes and is mandatory 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.860
 will be added in the house novel by 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.139
 less a house cleaning fee than the 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.240
 Not really a cleanup that's going to be 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.059
 made during your stay this cleaning 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.419
 and final cleaning from house to house by 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:51.339
 the owner is returned and a condition is 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.399
 delivery a clean condition 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:57.399
 all the houses already have available 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:06:00.789
 free wifi internet and also a program 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:02.110
 cable TV available for 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.059
 all users 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.469
 the vast majority of houses for rent 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:08.229
 season here in the united states 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:11.259
 young workshop it is logical that you can 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.939
 opt for a house without a pool and the price 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.159
 usually a little lower is 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.880
 much easier but if you have a 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.850
 home workshop needs to have a lot 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.040
 protection grid should be 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.650
 stay closed all the time 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.970
 especially if you have child 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.800
 in the house 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.880
 laws are very strict here in the 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.600
 united states 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.580
 in case of an accident in the pool 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.920
 mainly a child rent of 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.200
 house in season is the modality that 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.270
 more grow in the Brazilian tourist 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.700
 especially that tourist singing 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.210
 in family rainfall with a child 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.800
 like a more comfortable place 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.200
 tranquility and also pay a little 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.050
 less because financially crazy 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.350
 from home is undoubtedly a very 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.640
 cheaper than hotel accommodation 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.160
 traditional 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.170
