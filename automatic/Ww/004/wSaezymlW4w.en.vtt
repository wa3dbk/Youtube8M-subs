00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
competitors in this well I think it's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.979 
competitors in this well I think it's
the<00:03:22.370> two<00:03:22.489> obvious<00:03:22.880> teams<00:03:23.120> got<00:03:23.299> Brazil<00:03:23.660> with

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
the two obvious teams got Brazil with
