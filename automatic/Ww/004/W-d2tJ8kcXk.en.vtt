it's alive and we went back to the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
it's alive and we went back to the
stevia<00:00:27.349> now<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> stevia<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:31.070> what

you'll<00:00:32.219> notice<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> older<00:00:33.719> growth

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you'll notice is that the older growth

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.250 
you'll notice is that the older growth
will<00:00:34.649> become<00:00:34.950> woody<00:00:35.480> that's<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:39.260> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
will become woody that's there and you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959 
will become woody that's there and you
know<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.469> cut<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.820> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
know if you cut it down once it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.900 
know if you cut it down once it's
flowered<00:00:42.469> can<00:00:43.469> come<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.100> again<00:00:44.489> soon<00:00:44.700> so

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.900 

they're<00:02:24.510> ideally<00:02:26.130> especially<00:02:27.130> winter<00:02:27.670> anyway

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
they're ideally especially winter anyway

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.300 
they're ideally especially winter anyway
but<00:02:28.300> ideally<00:02:28.660> anyway<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> dip<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.160> into

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
but ideally anyway is to dip it into

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.980 
but ideally anyway is to dip it into
some<00:02:32.130> route<00:02:33.130> whole<00:02:33.430> milk<00:02:33.700> powder<00:02:33.840> let's<00:02:34.840> get

it on mmm Nick we're just trimmed it
messy<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:41.260> all<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> do<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.680> stick<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
messy and then all you do is stick it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.940 
messy and then all you do is stick it
into<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.800> soil

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
right pushy writer there but guard it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.880 
right pushy writer there but guard it
with<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.990> hand<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.930> did<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> few<00:02:56.830> weeks

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
with one hand and what did a few weeks

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.600 
with one hand and what did a few weeks
ago<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:58.240> plant<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.500> one<00:02:59.709> up<00:02:59.800> exactly

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
ago is a plant it this one up exactly

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.690 
ago is a plant it this one up exactly
the<00:03:00.700> same<00:03:00.760> way<00:03:01.030> as<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:02.530> one<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.250> one<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
the same way as a this one that one that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.600 
the same way as a this one that one that
one<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.270> one<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:05.740> can<00:03:05.890> see<00:03:06.040> here<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.550> is

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
one on that one you can see here this is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.580 
one on that one you can see here this is
got<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.880> new<00:03:07.030> girl<00:03:07.330> coming<00:03:07.540> out<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.530> is

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
got a new girl coming out of it this is

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.840 
got a new girl coming out of it this is
definitely<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.100> youth<00:03:09.250> growth<00:03:09.520> because<00:03:09.760> it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
definitely on youth growth because it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.790 
definitely on youth growth because it
was<00:03:09.940> only<00:03:10.090> about<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.810> tall<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.500> planted

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
was only about that tall and I planted

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.570 
was only about that tall and I planted
it<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.200> got<00:03:14.520> one<00:03:15.520> two<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.340> growth

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
it and so we got one two you growth

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220 
it and so we got one two you growth
there<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.240> little<00:03:19.390> bit<00:03:19.480> new<00:03:19.720> growth<00:03:19.990> down

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
there and a little bit new growth down

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.040 
there and a little bit new growth down
here<00:03:20.620> as<00:03:20.770> well<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.180> I'm<00:03:22.300> not<00:03:22.330> certain

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
here as well this one I'm not certain

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.620 
here as well this one I'm not certain
about<00:03:23.110> yeah<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:24.160> looks<00:03:24.340> like<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.670> might<00:03:25.120> start

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
about yeah it looks like it might start

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.479 
about yeah it looks like it might start
to<00:03:25.900> come<00:03:26.260> back<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.890> might<00:03:27.040> be<00:03:27.160> also<00:03:27.280> be

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
to come back but it might be also be

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.350 
to come back but it might be also be
writing<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.900> out<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.180> two<00:03:31.330> three

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
writing on but out of see one two three

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.509 
writing on but out of see one two three
four<00:03:31.780> five<00:03:32.260> plants<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.630> we've<00:03:34.630> got<00:03:35.519> four

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
four five plants and we've got four

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.160 
four five plants and we've got four
successes<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.300> you've<00:03:37.390> got<00:03:37.480> eighty<00:03:37.690> percent

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
successes so you've got eighty percent

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.470 
successes so you've got eighty percent
chance<00:03:38.769> there<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.000> didn't<00:03:40.239> actually<00:03:40.300> use

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
chance there and I didn't actually use

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.300 
chance there and I didn't actually use
growth<00:03:40.840> hormone<00:03:41.230> powder<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:42.100> this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
don't have any of this I'd open the test

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.719 
don't have any of this I'd open the test
comes<00:04:30.340> cluesive<00:04:30.820> yet<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:32.280> not<00:04:33.280> put<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.580> off<00:04:33.640> a

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
comes cluesive yet but not put you off a

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.570 
comes cluesive yet but not put you off a
bit<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.000> it

bit on it

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.990 
bit on it
all<00:04:35.760> right<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.800> that's<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.950> stevia<00:04:38.400> plant<00:04:38.550> but

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
all right so that's the stevia plant but

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.830 
all right so that's the stevia plant but
yeah<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.450> just<00:04:39.510> look<00:04:39.930> up<00:04:40.050> everything<00:04:40.400> and

yeah just just look up everything and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.780 
yeah just just look up everything and
you<00:04:42.840> know<00:04:42.990> definitely<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:44.100> research<00:04:44.370> foods

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
you know definitely to research foods

house<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.640> best<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.940> can<00:05:51.060> do<00:05:51.210> with

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
house so that's the best I can do with

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.160 
house so that's the best I can do with
at<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.630> moment<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:52.490> don't<00:05:53.490> put<00:05:53.850> in<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.240> in<00:05:55.020> the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
at the moment I don't put in the in the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.450 
at the moment I don't put in the in the
front<00:05:55.440> because<00:05:55.710> it<00:05:56.070> just<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.780> doesn't<00:05:57.960> get

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
front because it just the it doesn't get

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.530 
front because it just the it doesn't get
song<00:05:59.460> past<00:05:59.790> I<00:06:00.230> think<00:06:01.230> it's<00:06:02.060> one<00:06:03.060> o'clock<00:06:03.300> or

I've grown from seed so there may be

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.820 
I've grown from seed so there may be
more<00:06:38.190> or<00:06:38.250> less<00:06:38.460> than<00:06:39.060> 45<00:06:39.630> times<00:06:40.350> a<00:06:40.650> day<00:06:40.770> to

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.150 
sugar but the very sweet there's a
slight<00:06:43.230> plant<00:06:43.620> aftertaste<00:06:44.340> to<00:06:44.550> it<00:06:44.670> and
