00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 the mask may come either on the black body or 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 in the silicone body there are usually the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.939
 prefer apnea divers 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.119
 the black body masks 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.250
 the autonomous divers prefer the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 transparent because the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.239
 diver he likes to hunt that does 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 then apnea for the power to enter the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 you touch the black body makes the pupil 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 already more or less dilated 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 intelligence looks inside the burrow with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 greater ease and the diver 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 standalone as it only takes pictures of it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.270
 being able to go out in photos on the mask gives 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 better feeling of the person's face glass 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.480
 bandolier strip hardened and rim 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.010
 fixing all but new face 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 It needs to be washed using the lens 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 needs to be washed of life what 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 usually they put a resin of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 lens protection and this resin 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.540
 there what happens when you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.420
 We went diving, we did a maneuver. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 which is what to baptize the mask that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 baptism is for you to place a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.439
 old pretty wet take off the excess 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.570
 screen is not blurry if you do not 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.869
 have a team enough to salivate a good 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 exit but sometimes what happens she 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.670
 You can continue downloading then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.310
 resin that is attached to the mask 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 so you need to remove the one there each 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.509
 one has its recipe but it has to be 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.329
 something that you can take to require 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.600
 something the aids radium sap is 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.880
 toothpaste lighter I have seen several 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 important things be a soap that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.930
 have a property to be able to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 remove this resin then these flavors 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.200
 more neutral are not indicated to be 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.200
 one more thing above 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 many people think that the most expensive 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.460
 the better and the cheaper the worse it is not 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.530
 like this 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.670
 what people value comfort and quality 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.340
 then quality of the material and that it 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.500
 comfortable on the face and we 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.420
 test when you will acquire weapons 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.420
 because we handle strip mask sets 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.550
 puts forward in the face and gives a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.530
 equipped with noses and shaking the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.020
 head if the mask does not fall on the face. 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.050
 she gives a nice face 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.060
 there are costs there are also masks 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.430
 so I can say that one is better 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 that another that will depend on the person 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.160
 the comfort she will feel the comfort 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.750
 also public that field visual masks 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.770
 very tight very small 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 especially with the diver 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.250
 freelancer, right? 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.290
 I left a little bit limited in vision 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.970
 then the autonomous divers 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.820
 prefer large masks 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.280
 already mountaineers free divers 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.610
 they prefer a mask of a field 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.070
 because it is isolated from the lung to 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.070
 make the least use the EQ 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.150
 adjust you simply pick the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.560
 rods and puts on fully departs 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.959
 face and at the same time you pull the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.580
 extras 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.470
 it will give the necessary pressure to the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.370
 his face has no demise have not 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.370
 no other problem
