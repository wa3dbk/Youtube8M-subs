00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.180
 Hello and welcome to the otv 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.799
 How to bed so you lie this 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.670
 Of course, old wisdom also applies in the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.070
 outdoor area 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.430
 there one usually offers oneself up 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.530
 so mattresses insulation mats which 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.480
 different types it gives what you want 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.550
 pay attention when buying and what actually 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.760
 An acquisition is that I explain to you 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.760
 now 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 Although there are lots of sleeping pad 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.690
 but they are roughly in the market 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.170
 Divide two groups 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 on the one hand, there are foam mats 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.410
 These are hard ones 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.860
 closed foam such as eva 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 Lotte made the isolation at the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 foam mats comes through here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 material itself 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.590
 the more material is available so all the more 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.810
 better is the isolation 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 These types of sleeping pads are cheap 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.250
 and very robust after part of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.200
 Foam mats, however, are the big ones 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 Pack size and the lack of comfort 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 the second kind of iso mats are the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 Air mattresses they use one or 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 several layers of air for insulation 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 for this to work, it is important 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.220
 the air circulation between upper and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.110
 bottom inside the mat too 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 prevent 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.500
 the thicker an air mattress is and ever 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.080
 you better this air circulation 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.119
 prevents the better is also the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 isolation 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.350
 to prevent circulation there is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 the most different techniques the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.149
 just about used one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.130
 sophisticated system of chambers which 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.520
 the warm and cold air from each other 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.740
 separates 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.659
 the Swiss manufacturer expert, on the other hand 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.200
 uses fillings already in 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.909
 Sleeping bags have proven in the expert 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 is a synthetic fibers to 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.579
 use that visually reminds of cotton 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.920
 high quality down stuck in the 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.920
 expert download and take care of it there 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.689
 excellent isolation 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.519
 but the most widespread is one 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.370
 filling with soft open pores 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.349
 Foam this comes for example in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.480
 these towers rest per light mat for 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.040
 commitment 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.400
 To save weight will be from the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.690
 Foam stamped small chambers 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 The foam is not just com 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.920
 premier he was stretching too 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.750
 he automatically pulls out again 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.819
 Automatically a certain amount of air in 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.860
 the mat why you have this kind and 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.010
 inflate air mattresses yourself 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.799
 names other advantages of air mattresses 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.470
 are a ten-year pack size and one 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.910
 great comfort 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 However, these are kind of mats depending on 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.200
 filling significantly more expensive and at one 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.920
 hole in the mat is the isolation 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
 lost 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.730
 next to the type of sleeping mat is the 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.829
 experiences the most important property in the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.319
 German is thus the heat through all 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.150
 Resistance means he indicates how strong 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.329
 on material the flow of 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.000
 heat energy prevents the higher so 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.370
 the value of a sleeping pad is the deeper 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.769
 is the soil temperature up to you 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.750
 can be used 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.120
 but beware, there is one 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.769
 unique formula for the nutritional value though 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.560
 taken the procedure for the determination 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.719
 does not exist and so does it well 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.659
 The information of the manufacturer only as 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.489
 to understand guidelines in doubt 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.859
 you should therefore prefer one 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.319
 stronger mattress to lay or else 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.870
 combine two different sleeping pads 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.299
 since the individual he values a 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.819
 you can add up the total value of two 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.819
 mediocre sleeping pads do a good job 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.010
 There are other properties 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.560
 you should look out for something like that 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.870
 different shapes at iso mats the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.580
 normalform is rectangular and offers 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.180
 a lot of space to get around at night too 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.480
 move 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.520
 The mummy shape becomes narrower at the foot 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 That saves weight and allows it 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.530
 mat also in narrow tents to use 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.609
 The maximum weight saving brings 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.890
 the alpine form 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.620
 however, this matt form also offers 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.090
 hardly any freedom of movement 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.550
 In addition, there is ultra light 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.530
 half and three quarters of mats 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.720
 which in the leg area about with 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.260
 make clothes yourself for isolation 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.169
 No matter what shape a mat has the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.030
 corners should always be rounded 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.110
 otherwise they will be more stressed and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.570
 it comes here more quickly 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.550
 material fatigue 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.230
 apropos material so you do not at night 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.240
 with the sleeping bag from the mat slips 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.919
 Should the top be textured or 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.590
 as coated here 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.360
 The same applies to the bottom 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.000
 to prevent oneself from being with the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.919
 entire mat in the tent moves the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.050
 Valves should sit in a housing 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.210
 so as to be replaced by a defect 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.350
 to be able to 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.690
 Elongated valves should go beyond that 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.210
 attached to the side as they are on 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.550
 or bottom disturb and lighter 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.229
 to be damaged 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.450
 some sleeping mats put instead of one 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.450
 normal valves two flat valves 1 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.400
 These are less vulnerable 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.900
 but also less tightly closed and 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.500
 should therefore be absolutely tight 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.210
 to be checked certain air mattresses 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.080
 offer an integrated pump for 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.270
 pump up 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.430
 Here you should check that the pump 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.340
 Also big enough is the mat in 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.780
 reasonable time to pay 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.450
 Last but not least, the mat should be one 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.380
 repair kit is always there holes 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.380
 may occur 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.990
 Let's go to the conclusion shortly 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.029
 the care 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.219
 if you come back from a tour 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.900
 you should first of all the sleeping mat 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.279
 just with a soft rag and 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.009
 clean some water 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.169
 let the mat dry for 24 hours 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.960
 and checked the next day if they 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.650
 has lost air if so, the hole 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.729
 visited and maintained accordingly 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.969
 The mat should only be stored 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.279
 unpacked and with open valve more 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.800
 place has places or puts it completely 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.779
 spread out to a dry place 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.629
 For example, on a cupboard or under 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.759
 Bed alternatively you can the mat too 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:29.020
 curled up loosely and with a park 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:31.779
 tape fix so that was my movie over 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.999
 camping mats over praise or criticism 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.999
 I am looking forward to the forum
