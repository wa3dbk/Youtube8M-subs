more natural and with my sister like the
other<00:00:35.579> ones<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.329> too

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600

other ones I think we're a little too
white<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> thought<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.800> paranoid

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
white and then I thought was paranoid

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.500 
white and then I thought was paranoid
that<00:00:38.280> everyone<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.210> they're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that everyone was going to think they're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.740 
that everyone was going to think they're
not<00:00:40.320> natural<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:40.980> they're<00:00:41.190> too<00:00:41.370> white<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
not natural because they're too white so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.410 
not natural because they're too white so
