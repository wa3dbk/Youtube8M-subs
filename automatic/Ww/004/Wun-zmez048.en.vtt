00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.389
 hello to all and welcome to the guide 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.310
 proteins for a new test 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 now produces a product 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.710
 quite original that it is a syrup 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.720
 caramel brand 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
 walden farm so this mark is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 known especially in the United States for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 make products like this by 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.079
 example that contain 0 calories so 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.029
 diet products 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.239
 the goal is simply to allow you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 to have a diet with a better taste 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.980
 without putting into play the number of calories 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 that you absorb them 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.610
 so when I'm going to say it's a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.610
 product that contains 2 0 calories so 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.700
 there are zero carbohydrates 0 lipids 0 protein 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.860
 on1 the ingredients we have water from 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 salt aromas of caramel and vanilla 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 fiber dyes and that's pretty much 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.090
 close everything and so the whole texture is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.890
 made by the fibers and we know it to 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 no calories and then after 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.400
 taste and color with aromas 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 including caramel and also to the team 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.409
 with a little sugar loos then 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 it's a pretty original baer product 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.899
 quite weird compared to what I have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.570
 the habit of testing so we'll see this 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:16.590
 it gives I do not know whether the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 shake but good in doubt then 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 salary to do something enough 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.840
 thick is still very thick even 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840
 anyway 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.680
 it smells very very strong because a mixture 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.180
 of 110.6 it really has a taste of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 caramel 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.330
 texture and it feels but I say 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.299
 it's pretty thick but it's still 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.190
 very fluid in the mouth it is very sweet 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.100
 maybe even too bad and 1000 dead 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.060
 it's caramel I mean logical 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.020
 it's really nice I was not expecting 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 really we really are that the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.049
 end is much more chemical than that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.909
 finally it is really very very 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.570
 natural, we still feel the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.610
 sweet side of sucralose behind so a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.650
 interesting original product if you 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.570
 are dieters to use for example if 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.060
 you make pancakes eventually 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.979
 even on pancakes 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.970
 protein or that egg whites I 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.619
 think about will help you to them 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.610
 improve to have a little taste 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.500
 little they change because that's true 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360
 that it is very quickly wearisome and to note 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.650
 also that this type of product exists in 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.780
 other fragrances with raspberry appearance 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.880
 blackcurrant or chocolate or maple syrup 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 no, that's it, that was a little video 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.780
 fast enough for an original product 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.730
 who can save you in quotation marks the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.510
 dieting I'm pretty surprised I 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.370
 was really expecting it to be 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.410
 less good than that so we have a real taste 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580
 caramel and then with a product 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.260
 again zero calorie 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.370
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.890
 not to make a little green chick on 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.880
 youtube it's always a pleasure 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.170
 and then do not hesitate either to you
