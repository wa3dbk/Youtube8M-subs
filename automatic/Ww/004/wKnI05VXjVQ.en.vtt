want to win every game so even when
we're<00:01:56.940> losing<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.540> our<00:01:58.260> belief<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.920> through

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
we're losing on our belief is through

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.090 
we're losing on our belief is through
that<00:01:59.370> will<00:01:59.580> come<00:01:59.790> back<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> win<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.710> what<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that will come back and win and what we

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
that will come back and win and what we
always<00:02:02.220> believe<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.610> will<00:02:02.940> score<00:02:03.150> more

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

goals<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> opposition's<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.830> think<00:02:05.600> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
goals in the opposition's I think that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
goals in the opposition's I think that
helped<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.050> lot<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.440> game<00:02:07.770> against<00:02:08.399> Perth

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
helped a lot in the game against Perth

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
helped a lot in the game against Perth
because<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.479> had<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.960> core<00:02:10.710> belief<00:02:11.070> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
because we we had that core belief that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460 
because we we had that core belief that
we<00:02:11.340> had<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.700> other<00:02:11.880> season<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.630> we<00:02:12.840> will<00:02:13.320> be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

helps it's like a 12-man a time so it's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.460 
helps it's like a 12-man a time so it's
going<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> lot<00:03:30.489> tougher<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.350> end

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
going to be a lot tougher but in the end

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.440 
going to be a lot tougher but in the end
that's<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.370> limit<00:03:33.640> via<00:03:33.760> living<00:03:34.180> playing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
that's just the limit via living playing

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.240 
that's just the limit via living playing
a<00:03:34.600> game<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.780> football<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.440> same<00:03:35.769> page<00:03:36.010> with

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
a game of football on the same page with

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.720 
a game of football on the same page with
the<00:03:36.400> same<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.049> rules<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:38.980> regulations

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the same kind of rules and regulations

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.630 
the same kind of rules and regulations
so<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:40.720> going<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.400> tough<00:03:42.400> game

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so it's it's going to be a tough game

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.550 
so it's it's going to be a tough game
they're<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> very<00:03:43.150> good<00:03:43.239> team<00:03:43.450> know<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.140> but

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
defense has been extremely leaky on a

defense has been extremely leaky on a
number<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.600> occasions<00:04:10.859> no<00:04:11.859> one<00:04:12.040> doubts<00:04:12.340> that

number of occasions no one doubts that

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.789 
number of occasions no one doubts that
you<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.299> your<00:04:13.390> forwards<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:14.049> score<00:04:14.290> goals<00:04:14.320> do

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
you feel that you've actually got tight

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.830 
you feel that you've actually got tight
enough<00:04:16.989> defense<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.590> go<00:04:17.709> all<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.010> way<00:04:18.039> oh<00:04:18.840> yeah

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
enough defense to go all the way oh yeah

enough defense to go all the way oh yeah
I<00:04:20.289> definitely<00:04:20.500> think<00:04:20.950> we<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.310> we<00:04:21.640> can<00:04:21.789> win<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150

I definitely think we can we can win the
win<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> whole<00:04:22.930> thing<00:04:23.580> we've<00:04:24.580> been<00:04:24.849> focusing

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
on a lot

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.580 
on a lot
on<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> lot<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:27.150> defend<00:04:27.690> from<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.080> front<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
on a lot to defend from the front the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.040 
on a lot to defend from the front the
midfield<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.160> there<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:30.480> defense<00:04:30.840> in

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
midfield in there and the defense in

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
midfield in there and the defense in
like<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.500> said<00:04:31.710> we've<00:04:31.920> laid<00:04:32.670> quite<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> lot<00:04:33.210> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
like you said we've laid quite a lot of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.680 
like you said we've laid quite a lot of
goals<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:33.840> i'm<00:04:35.000> hopefully<00:04:36.000> i<00:04:36.030> might<00:04:36.480> being

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
goals but i'm hopefully i might being

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.450 
goals but i'm hopefully i might being
there<00:04:36.870> i'm<00:04:37.110> sure<00:04:37.380> they<00:04:37.650> will<00:04:37.830> turn<00:04:38.070> i<00:04:38.280> will

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
there i'm sure they will turn i will

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.860 
there i'm sure they will turn i will
give<00:04:38.610> everything<00:04:38.760> we've<00:04:39.180> got<00:04:39.330> would<00:04:39.540> defend

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
give everything we've got would defend

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.480 
give everything we've got would defend
from<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.260> front<00:04:40.530> because<00:04:40.980> i<00:04:41.100> think<00:04:41.160> that's

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
from the front because i think that's

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.730 
from the front because i think that's
what<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:41.639> need<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.030> work<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.080> lot<00:04:43.260> on<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.560> not

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
what we need to work a lot on is not

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.129 
what we need to work a lot on is not
letting<00:04:43.950> them<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.250> out<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.639> easy<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.180> i<00:04:45.419> will

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
letting them get out so easy and i will

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.590 
letting them get out so easy and i will
be<00:04:46.169> working<00:04:46.410> on<00:04:46.740> there<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.160> i<00:04:47.510> think<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
be working on there and i think the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.990 
be working on there and i think the
defenders<00:04:49.020> will<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:49.320> will<00:04:50.190> be<00:04:50.340> more<00:04:50.550> than<00:04:50.580> RN

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
defenders will we will be more than RN

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.360 
defenders will we will be more than RN
obviously<00:04:51.600> will<00:04:52.169> score<00:04:52.410> enough<00:04:52.650> goals<00:04:52.680> where

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
obviously will score enough goals where

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.820 
obviously will score enough goals where
do<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.520> see<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.000> Mariners<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.560> main

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
do you see the Mariners you know main

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.370 
do you see the Mariners you know main
thrust<00:04:56.250> coming<00:04:56.460> from<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.540> where<00:04:57.870> do<00:04:58.260> you

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.159 
thrust coming from and where do you
regard<00:04:58.770> their<00:04:59.130> strengths<00:04:59.550> as<00:04:59.730> being<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.750> think

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
regard their strengths as being I think

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.200 
regard their strengths as being I think
they're<00:05:01.530> pretty<00:05:01.650> good<00:05:01.890> on<00:05:02.040> the

they're<00:05:12.600> very<00:05:12.630> good<00:05:12.900> at<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.490> transition<00:05:14.490> sort

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
they're very good at the transition sort

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.680 
they're very good at the transition sort
of<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.570> game<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.530> think<00:05:17.220> we<00:05:17.490> just<00:05:17.610> gotta<00:05:17.850> try

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
of the game so I think we just gotta try

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.330 
of the game so I think we just gotta try
and<00:05:18.720> minimize<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.380> mistakes<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.890> we<00:05:20.100> make

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
and minimize the mistakes that we make

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.840 
and minimize the mistakes that we make
in<00:05:20.810> make<00:05:21.810> sure<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:22.260> we're<00:05:22.500> thinking<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.700> lot

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
in make sure that we're thinking a lot

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.159 
in make sure that we're thinking a lot
off<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.240> ball<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.540> getting<00:05:24.720> into<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.050> right

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
off the ball and getting into the right

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.260 
off the ball and getting into the right
position<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:25.680> they<00:05:25.979> can't<00:05:26.340> hurt<00:05:26.490> us<00:05:26.550> your
