00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
very very surely and it goes on really

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.510 
very very surely and it goes on really
nicely<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.560> texture<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.009> I<00:01:55.070> said<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.369> little

nicely the texture as I said is a little
bit<00:01:55.759> different<00:01:56.060> from<00:01:56.150> most<00:01:56.360> concealers<00:01:56.780> which

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
bit different from most concealers which

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.840 
bit different from most concealers which
are<00:01:57.170> quite<00:01:57.320> creamy<00:01:57.650> they<00:01:58.250> still<00:01:58.520> has<00:01:58.729> the

are quite creamy they still has the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.760 
are quite creamy they still has the
possibility<00:01:59.420> decrease<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:00.290> quite<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
possibility decrease but not quite the

we are all different colors I think it's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.140
