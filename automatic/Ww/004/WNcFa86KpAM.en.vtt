00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
video um I was actually I heard about

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.580 
video um I was actually I heard about
this<00:00:28.380> method<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.070> while<00:00:29.609> back<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.689> can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this method a while back like I can

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.440 
this method a while back like I can
probably<00:00:31.769> say<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.870> few<00:00:33.870> months<00:00:34.170> ago<00:00:34.430> but

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450
