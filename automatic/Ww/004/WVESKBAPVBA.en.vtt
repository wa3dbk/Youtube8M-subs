the map and underneath this bunker there

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.870 
the map and underneath this bunker there
is<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> spinning<00:02:22.830> black<00:02:23.040> square<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:23.700> I've

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
is a spinning black square which I've

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
is a spinning black square which I've
also<00:02:24.030> talked<00:02:24.420> about<00:02:24.540> before<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.050> relates<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
also talked about before that relates to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000 
also talked about before that relates to
the<00:02:25.890> UFOs<00:02:26.340> around<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.750> whole<00:02:27.900> map<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.260> GTA<00:02:28.620> 5

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the UFOs around the whole map of GTA 5

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.580 
the UFOs around the whole map of GTA 5
and<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.420> spinning<00:02:30.690> black<00:02:30.900> square<00:02:31.260> if<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.440> saw

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and the spinning black square if you saw

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.809 
and the spinning black square if you saw
at<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.709> beginning<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.250> video<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.730> way

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
at the beginning of this video the way

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.460 
at the beginning of this video the way
the<00:02:32.970> jetpack<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.360> san<00:02:33.630> andreas<00:02:34.050> was<00:02:34.200> just

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the jetpack and san andreas was just

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.110 
the jetpack and san andreas was just
floating<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> air<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> spinning<00:02:35.550> that's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
floating in the air and spinning that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
floating in the air and spinning that's
exactly<00:02:36.599> what<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.930> black<00:02:37.200> square<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> doing

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
exactly what this black square is doing

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
exactly what this black square is doing
so<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.120> leads<00:02:39.300> me<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.599> believe<00:02:39.630> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so that's what leads me to believe that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
so that's what leads me to believe that
this<00:02:40.410> bunker<00:02:40.860> may<00:02:41.099> hold<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> jetpack<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
this bunker may hold the jetpack that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.509 
this bunker may hold the jetpack that
you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.930> added<00:02:43.319> into<00:02:43.590> GTA<00:02:43.920> 5<00:02:44.220> later

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
you know if it's added into GTA 5 later

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.120 
you know if it's added into GTA 5 later
on<00:02:44.760> also<00:02:45.630> there's<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.019> UFO<00:02:46.410> directly<00:02:46.920> above

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
on also there's a UFO directly above

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.740 
on also there's a UFO directly above
this<00:02:47.310> bunker<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.730> shines<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.180> light<00:02:48.299> down<00:02:48.360> on

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this bunker that shines a light down on

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.259 
this bunker that shines a light down on
it<00:02:48.900> at<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> certain<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.590> day<00:02:49.739> are<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:51.060> night

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
it at a certain time of day are of night

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.390 
it at a certain time of day are of night
I<00:02:51.299> should<00:02:51.510> say<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.830> shines<00:02:52.980> us<00:02:53.190> green

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
I should say and it shines us green

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
I should say and it shines us green
light<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.090> bunker<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.780> um<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:56.100> do

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
light just on this bunker so um I I do

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.250 
light just on this bunker so um I I do
believe<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.850> bunker<00:02:57.209> plays<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.630> significant

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
believe this bunker plays a significant

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.900
