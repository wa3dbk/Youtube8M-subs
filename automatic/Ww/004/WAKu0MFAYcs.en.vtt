there<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> set<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.980> little<00:00:17.310> tree

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
there is to the set it's a little tree

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.670 
there is to the set it's a little tree
house<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> squirrel<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.230> guess<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
house with a squirrel and I guess this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.099 
house with a squirrel and I guess this
is<00:00:19.859> supposed<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.340> squirrel<00:00:20.820> food<00:00:21.109> that's

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is supposed to be squirrel food that's

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.240 
is supposed to be squirrel food that's
what<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> call<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.010> anyway<00:00:23.900> and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
what I'm going to call it anyway and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.529 
what I'm going to call it anyway and
this<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.430> set<00:00:26.699> costs<00:00:26.939> about<00:00:27.090> five<00:00:27.330> dollars

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this little set costs about five dollars

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.299 
this little set costs about five dollars
which<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.250> high<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> but

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
which is a little bit high for this but

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.790 
which is a little bit high for this but
anyway<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.989> bag<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.350> comes<00:00:34.559> in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
anyway this is the bag that it comes in

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.430 
anyway this is the bag that it comes in
you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> series<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.440> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you can see this is series one so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
you can see this is series one so
apparently<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.550> more

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
apparently there's going to be more

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
apparently there's going to be more
serious<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.230> believe<00:00:40.530> there

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
serious like this and I believe there

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
serious like this and I believe there
were<00:00:41.040> three<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> these<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.300> came<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
were three of these that came out in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.130 
were three of these that came out in
series<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.370> squirrel<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
series one it's a squirrel I think a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
series one it's a squirrel I think a
turtle<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> cat<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
