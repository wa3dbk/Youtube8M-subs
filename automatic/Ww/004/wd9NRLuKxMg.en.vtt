00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.010
 it's not understanding anything about the team 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.570
 mini was caught on his own 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.760
 trap by announcing a fixed ranking 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.290
 until the arrival stÃ©phane peterhansel to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
 he does everything in any case to respect 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.260
 instructions during the 12th stage 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.790
 Roman melanie punctured 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.619
 and who then did not want to take the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.000
 race to his account so left the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 first place overall for 26 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 seconds at the serena we'll see from any 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.460
 way the proper race instructions 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.100
 maybe to be refreshed but we have them 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.449
 will listen in any case in Marc motorcycles 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.860
 coma is almost assured of victory 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.780
 but joan barreda edge you demonstrated 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.400
 yesterday that nothing was played as long as the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.900
 line had not gone through two 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.309
 first podiums for him on the dakar 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.379
 he lost two and a half hours after 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.089
 having broken his olive fork bread in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 take the opportunity to ride maybe on his 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.659
 first podium in valparaiso last 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.729
 step will see such a ultimate rebound 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.729
 in motorcycle as in auto business to follow 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
 today was therefore day of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 catch up at mini nani roma has taken over 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.690
 his first place in general giniel de 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.470
 villiers for him to console himself with a 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.180
 stage victory 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.159
 in motorcycles on the other hand place to the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.460
 parade to valparaiso coma wheel 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.990
 free 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.860
 weary stage victory to bar first 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.860
 that the big loser of the year 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 at 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.260
 little arrangements between fake friends to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 the arrival of this dakar 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.110
 we can now wonder if the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.820
 yesterday's takeover of stÃ©phane 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 peterhansel was not just a simple 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.420
 smoke screen today the French has 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.690
 let his Spanish teammate pass 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.730
 dani romao km 133 roman ends so 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.530
 in front of the titleholder who will not glean 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.840
 no twelfth success on the Dakar 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.100
 we imposed with more than 5 minutes on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.690
 Peterhansel 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 nasser al attiyah finished him with less than one 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.440
 hour the first car not min and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.120
 that of giniel de villiers who wins 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.130
 the day step but ranks fourth 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.660
 at almost two hours to General Roma 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.000
 after that of 2004 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.000
 it was outside 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.509
 the greatest thought is for my 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.369
 former co-pilot henry magne who died 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.990
 in an accident at my side it's 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.739
 someone who taught me so much 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.720
 victory is for him 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.610

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.739

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:26.500
