shell<00:05:34.789> manicure<00:05:35.660> this<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.500> actually<00:05:37.010> like

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
shell manicure this is actually like

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.939 
shell manicure this is actually like
base<00:05:37.610> coat<00:05:37.910> type<00:05:38.180> thing<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:38.870> then<00:05:39.080> this<00:05:39.320> has

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
base coat type thing and then this has

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.670 
base coat type thing and then this has
crushed<00:05:40.729> shells<00:05:41.270> in<00:05:41.449> it<00:05:41.570> so<00:05:42.020> when<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.289> have<00:05:42.500> it

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
crushed shells in it so when you have it

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.000 
crushed shells in it so when you have it
it<00:05:42.800> gives<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.190> OPI<00:05:43.760> liquid<00:05:44.330> sand<00:05:44.690> 3d<00:05:45.440> kind<00:05:45.800> of

it gives that OPI liquid sand 3d kind of
effect<00:05:46.340> except<00:05:46.729> you<00:05:46.789> have<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.240> kind<00:05:47.449> of<00:05:47.539> put<00:05:47.720> it

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
effect except you have to kind of put it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.300 
effect except you have to kind of put it
all<00:05:47.900> together<00:05:48.080> manually<00:05:48.860> because<00:05:49.039> these<00:05:49.159> are

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
all together manually because these are

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.029 
all together manually because these are
literally<00:05:49.789> just<00:05:49.820> loose<00:05:50.720> shell<00:05:51.289> pieces<00:05:51.590> so<00:05:52.010> you
