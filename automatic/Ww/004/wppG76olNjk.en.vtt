00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
side noises then there are other

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480 
side noises then there are other
microphones<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.530> go<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:24.010> these<00:02:24.190> side

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
microphones that go with these side

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.610 
microphones that go with these side
noises<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> bit<00:02:25.270> better<00:02:25.540> than<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> level<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
noises a bit better than the level you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.920 
noises a bit better than the level you
like<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:27.640> instance<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.210> I'm<00:02:28.390> talking<00:02:28.570> through

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
like for instance if I'm talking through

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.890 
like for instance if I'm talking through
this<00:02:29.080> handheld<00:02:29.440> right<00:02:29.830> now<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.510> music<00:02:31.810> is

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
this handheld right now and the music is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.320 
this handheld right now and the music is
playing<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.920> hear<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.940> lot

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
playing you can actually hear a lot

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
playing you can actually hear a lot
better

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.369 

so<00:02:40.310> that's<00:02:40.760> that's<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.480> difference<00:02:41.870> hello

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
so that's that's the difference hello

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.830 
so that's that's the difference hello
testing<00:02:42.830> testing<00:02:43.190> hello<00:02:44.000> testing<00:02:44.450> testing

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
testing testing hello testing testing

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.080 
testing testing hello testing testing
now<00:02:47.860> there<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> third<00:02:49.400> option<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.849> could

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
now there is a third option you could

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.619 
now there is a third option you could
choose<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:51.230> internal<00:02:51.980> microphone<00:02:52.629> the

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
choose it's the internal microphone the

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.309 
choose it's the internal microphone the
internal<00:02:54.110> microphone<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.269> camera

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
internal microphone is the camera

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.720 
internal microphone is the camera
microphone<00:02:57.319> built<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.890> camera<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.489> could

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
microphone built in the camera you could

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.309 
microphone built in the camera you could
use<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.150> but<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.379> results<00:03:00.980> are<00:03:01.160> not<00:03:01.849> always<00:03:02.540> of

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
use it but the results are not always of

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.399 
use it but the results are not always of
a<00:03:03.769> very<00:03:04.069> high<00:03:04.340> sound<00:03:05.030> quality<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
a very high sound quality that is

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.130 
a very high sound quality that is
because<00:03:06.829> you're<00:03:07.790> far<00:03:08.120> away<00:03:08.360> from<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.810> source

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
because you're far away from your source

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.530 
because you're far away from your source
and<00:03:09.440> as<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.280> built<00:03:10.579> in<00:03:10.790> your<00:03:11.030> camera<00:03:11.269> its

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and as it is built in your camera its

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.930 
and as it is built in your camera its
small<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.230> while<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.069> sound<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.549> traveling

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
small and while the sound is traveling

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.670 
small and while the sound is traveling
through<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.239> air<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.510> picks<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.870> side<00:03:15.200> noises

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
through the air it picks up side noises

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.970 
through the air it picks up side noises
and<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.760> will<00:03:17.150> create<00:03:18.579> reverberation

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and it will create reverberation

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.300 
and it will create reverberation
reverberation<00:03:23.410> though<00:03:24.410> there<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.739> solution

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
reverberation though there is a solution

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.729 
reverberation though there is a solution

to solve this problem we need to know

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.330 
to solve this problem we need to know

technical part so Klaus ya reverb yes if

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.520 
technical part so Klaus ya reverb yes if
you<00:03:55.669> have<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.849> piece<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.510> sound<00:03:56.720> will<00:03:57.109> not<00:03:57.139> only

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
you have a piece of sound will not only

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.500 
you have a piece of sound will not only
go<00:03:57.769> directly<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.459> your<00:03:58.579> microphone<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.389> it

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
go directly to your microphone but it

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.390 
go directly to your microphone but it
also<00:03:59.630> gets<00:03:59.959> reflected<00:04:00.260> from<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.829> walls<00:04:01.069> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
also gets reflected from the walls the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.729 
also gets reflected from the walls the
ceiling<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:01.970> floor<00:04:02.239> and<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:03.230> arrives<00:04:03.530> at

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
ceiling of the floor and it arrives at

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.349 
ceiling of the floor and it arrives at
the<00:04:03.829> microphone<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> tiny<00:04:04.700> little<00:04:04.940> bit<00:04:05.150> later

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
the microphone a tiny little bit later

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.629 
the microphone a tiny little bit later
than<00:04:05.660> your<00:04:05.780> direct<00:04:06.139> sound<00:04:06.349> okay<00:04:07.250> since<00:04:07.489> it's

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
than your direct sound okay since it's

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.400 
than your direct sound okay since it's
coming<00:04:07.880> from<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.269> same<00:04:08.450> sound<00:04:08.750> source<00:04:09.049> this

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
coming from the same sound source this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.580 
coming from the same sound source this
will<00:04:09.680> create<00:04:09.950> your<00:04:10.220> reverb<00:04:10.639> or<00:04:10.880> your<00:04:11.049> room<00:04:12.079> yes

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
will create your reverb or your room yes

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.520 
will create your reverb or your room yes
very<00:04:12.889> echoey<00:04:13.549> yes<00:04:14.359> sometimes<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.109> might<00:04:15.319> have

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
very echoey yes sometimes you might have

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.250 
very echoey yes sometimes you might have
to<00:04:15.680> record<00:04:16.010> from<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.519> distance<00:04:17.359> yeah<00:04:18.049> if<00:04:18.139> you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
to record from a distance yeah if you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.529 
to record from a distance yeah if you
can't<00:04:18.500> get<00:04:18.680> close<00:04:19.070> right<00:04:19.489> yeah<00:04:19.940> exactly

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
can't get close right yeah exactly

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.779 
can't get close right yeah exactly
and<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:21.260> give<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.560> tool<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.580> to

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
and to give you a tool to do that and to

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.730 
and to give you a tool to do that and to
record<00:04:23.150> without<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.870> reverb<00:04:24.410> or<00:04:24.620> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
record without the reverb or the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.620 
record without the reverb or the
unwanted<00:04:25.039> noise<00:04:25.430> from<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.820> side<00:04:26.060> we<00:04:26.300> came<00:04:26.510> up

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
unwanted noise from the side we came up

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.330 
unwanted noise from the side we came up
with<00:04:26.720> shotgun<00:04:27.110> microphones<00:04:27.610> right<00:04:28.930> shotguns

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
with shotgun microphones right shotguns

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.610 
with shotgun microphones right shotguns
right<00:04:31.340> here<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:32.229> like<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:35.000> one<00:04:35.380> right

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.200 

yeah<00:04:39.620> exactly<00:04:39.940> yeah

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
yeah exactly yeah

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.270 
yeah exactly yeah
and<00:04:41.599> you<00:04:41.720> can<00:04:41.930> see<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.410> interference<00:04:42.620> tube

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
and you can see the interference tube

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.089 
and you can see the interference tube
with<00:04:43.520> all<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:43.820> small<00:04:44.060> holes<00:04:44.270> on<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.630> side<00:04:44.840> and

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
with all the small holes on the side and

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.350 
with all the small holes on the side and
this<00:04:46.099> is<00:04:46.250> where<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.550> sound<00:04:46.700> comes<00:04:47.000> into<00:04:47.240> the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
this is where the sound comes into the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.470 
this is where the sound comes into the
microphone<00:04:47.870> and

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
microphone and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.690 
microphone and
were<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.900> reverb<00:04:49.350> is<00:04:49.500> canceled<00:04:50.040> out<00:04:50.130> inside

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
were the reverb is canceled out inside

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.880 
were the reverb is canceled out inside
the<00:04:50.850> microphone<00:04:51.300> by<00:04:51.510> its<00:04:51.660> design<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
the microphone by its design so the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.590 
the microphone by its design so the
reverb<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.310> actually<00:04:53.640> destroyed<00:04:54.090> because<00:04:54.450> of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
reverb is actually destroyed because of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.950 
reverb is actually destroyed because of
the<00:04:54.720> design<00:04:55.190> that's<00:04:56.190> pretty<00:04:56.580> cool

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
the design that's pretty cool

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.050 
the design that's pretty cool
so<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.470> could<00:04:58.650> put<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:58.950> on<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.580> boom<00:04:59.820> bomb

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
so you could put it on on a boom bomb

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.240 
so you could put it on on a boom bomb
but<00:05:00.990> we<00:05:01.260> couldn't<00:05:01.500> also<00:05:01.620> mount<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.040> on<00:05:02.160> the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
but we couldn't also mount it on the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.740 
but we couldn't also mount it on the
camera<00:05:02.490> or<00:05:02.760> even<00:05:02.790> use<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.330> as<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.480> handheld

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
camera or even use it as a handheld

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.440 
camera or even use it as a handheld
microphone<00:05:04.350> for<00:05:04.560> an<00:05:04.680> interview<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:06.270> and

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
microphone for an interview right and

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.720 
microphone for an interview right and
actually<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:07.170> shotgun<00:05:07.440> microphone<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
actually a shotgun microphone is the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.730 
actually a shotgun microphone is the
most<00:05:09.150> accurate<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:09.690> best<00:05:10.020> way<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.230> record

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
most accurate and best way to record

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.210 
most accurate and best way to record
sound<00:05:11.130> why<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.650> it's<00:05:13.650> because<00:05:13.980> of<00:05:14.010> the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
sound why is that it's because of the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.920 
sound why is that it's because of the
hydro<00:05:14.490> activity<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.210> we<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.480> simple<00:05:15.900> test

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
hydro activity and we have a simple test

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.980 
hydro activity and we have a simple test
to<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:17.250> determine<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.760> directivity<00:05:18.150> we<00:05:18.780> call

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
to to determine the directivity we call

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.180 
to to determine the directivity we call
it<00:05:19.140> to<00:05:19.230> his<00:05:19.410> test<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:20.550> one<00:05:20.730> to<00:05:21.270> his<00:05:21.480> test<00:05:22.190> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
it to his test the one to his test you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.270 
it to his test the one to his test you
know<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.400> just<00:05:23.670> say<00:05:23.940> hiss<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:25.560> then<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.130> move

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
know you just say hiss and then you move

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.800 
know you just say hiss and then you move
around<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.760> microphone<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:27.450> listen<00:05:27.780> to

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
around the microphone and you listen to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.440 
around the microphone and you listen to
it<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.740> when<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:28.980> do<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:29.370> you<00:05:29.730> will<00:05:29.880> find<00:05:30.240> out

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
it and when you do so you will find out

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.810 
it and when you do so you will find out
that<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.870> sound<00:05:31.110> from<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.500> side<00:05:31.770> is<00:05:32.070> not<00:05:32.310> as

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
that the sound from the side is not as

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.730 
that the sound from the side is not as
strong<00:05:33.300> as<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.570> sound<00:05:33.930> from<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.230> front<00:05:34.500> and

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
strong as a sound from the front and

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.890 
strong as a sound from the front and
since<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.430> have<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.610> shotgun<00:05:35.940> microphone<00:05:36.270> here

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
since you have a shotgun microphone here

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.530 
since you have a shotgun microphone here
the<00:05:37.740> sound<00:05:38.010> from<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.310> side<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.850> almost<00:05:39.270> gone

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
the sound from the side is almost gone

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.630 
the sound from the side is almost gone
while<00:05:39.930> from<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.350> front<00:05:40.620> it's<00:05:41.100> very<00:05:41.160> strong

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
while from the front it's very strong

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.930 
while from the front it's very strong
this<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.330> what<00:05:42.510> we<00:05:42.630> call<00:05:42.810> low<00:05:43.050> bar<00:05:43.430> low<00:05:44.430> bar

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
this is what we call low bar low bar

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.840 
this is what we call low bar low bar
okay<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:46.290> shotguns<00:05:47.000> are<00:05:48.000> low<00:05:48.270> bar<00:05:49.580> where<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
okay so shotguns are low bar where the

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.410 
okay so shotguns are low bar where the
level<00:05:51.150> ear<00:05:51.240> mic<00:05:51.510> is<00:05:52.610> omnidirectional<00:05:53.610> as<00:05:54.240> it

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
level ear mic is omnidirectional as it

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.920 
level ear mic is omnidirectional as it
picks<00:05:55.170> up<00:05:55.380> sound<00:05:55.650> from<00:05:55.920> all<00:05:56.100> over<00:05:56.690> right<00:05:57.690> so

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
picks up sound from all over right so

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.990 
picks up sound from all over right so
this<00:05:58.230> is<00:05:58.470> these<00:05:59.070> are<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.400> options<00:05:59.760> you<00:05:59.970> have

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
this is these are the options you have

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.840 
this is these are the options you have
and<00:06:00.420> if<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.170> get<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:01.470> right<00:06:01.680> this<00:06:02.250> is<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.670> most

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
and if I get this right this is the most

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.090 
and if I get this right this is the most
accurate<00:06:03.330> one<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.660> record<00:06:03.960> sound<00:06:04.230> with<00:06:04.290> right

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
accurate one to record sound with right

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.790 
accurate one to record sound with right
correct<00:06:05.640> right<00:06:06.300> because<00:06:06.990> it's<00:06:07.470> very

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
correct right because it's very

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.580 
correct right because it's very
directive<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.670> it<00:06:09.030> doesn't<00:06:09.330> pick<00:06:09.450> up<00:06:09.630> noise

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
directive and it doesn't pick up noise

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.910 
directive and it doesn't pick up noise
from<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:11.070> sides<00:06:11.310> only<00:06:11.670> from<00:06:12.570> what<00:06:13.290> it's<00:06:13.440> aimed

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
from the sides only from what it's aimed

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.270 
from the sides only from what it's aimed
at<00:06:14.100> yeah<00:06:15.170> but<00:06:16.170> that's<00:06:16.290> very<00:06:16.620> delicate<00:06:16.800> as<00:06:17.130> well

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
at yeah but that's very delicate as well

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.850 
at yeah but that's very delicate as well
because<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:17.640> aim<00:06:17.850> in<00:06:18.390> the<00:06:18.780> wrong<00:06:18.990> way<00:06:19.260> I<00:06:19.500> won't

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
because you aim in the wrong way I won't

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.770 
because you aim in the wrong way I won't
pick<00:06:20.040> up<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.520> stuff<00:06:20.790> that<00:06:21.150> you<00:06:21.330> want<00:06:21.540> to<00:06:21.630> have

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
pick up the stuff that you want to have

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.830 
pick up the stuff that you want to have
so<00:06:22.710> it's<00:06:22.980> very<00:06:23.130> delicate<00:06:23.370> to<00:06:23.730> use<00:06:23.910> correct

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
so it's very delicate to use correct

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.580 
so it's very delicate to use correct
yeah<00:06:26.240> okay<00:06:27.240> but<00:06:27.630> make<00:06:27.930> sure<00:06:27.960> if<00:06:28.290> you<00:06:28.380> use<00:06:28.410> a

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
yeah okay but make sure if you use a

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.380 
yeah okay but make sure if you use a
shotgun<00:06:28.950> microphone<00:06:29.250> always<00:06:30.000> to<00:06:30.180> use<00:06:30.360> a

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
shotgun microphone always to use a

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.580 
shotgun microphone always to use a
windshield<00:06:30.810> for<00:06:31.290> it

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
windshield for it

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.860 
windshield for it
shotgun<00:06:32.400> microphones<00:06:32.880> are<00:06:33.090> very<00:06:33.270> sensitive

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
shotgun microphones are very sensitive

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.150 
shotgun microphones are very sensitive
to<00:06:34.110> wind<00:06:34.470> noise<00:06:34.710> wind<00:06:35.070> noise<00:06:35.970> yeah<00:06:36.660> so<00:06:37.260> got

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
to wind noise wind noise yeah so got

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.400 
to wind noise wind noise yeah so got
foam<00:06:38.460> ones<00:06:38.760> or<00:06:39.660> you<00:06:39.840> got<00:06:39.990> a<00:06:40.020> dead<00:06:40.710> cat<00:06:40.980> that<00:06:41.550> can

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
foam ones or you got a dead cat that can

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.680 
foam ones or you got a dead cat that can
if<00:06:43.410> you<00:06:43.620> get<00:06:43.800> all<00:06:43.950> of<00:06:44.100> this<00:06:44.250> right<00:06:44.520> the<00:06:45.180> rest<00:06:45.420> is

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
if you get all of this right the rest is

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.050 
if you get all of this right the rest is
pretty<00:06:46.050> straightforward<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:47.040> plug<00:06:47.730> in<00:06:47.880> the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
pretty straightforward just plug in the

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.350 
pretty straightforward just plug in the
XLR<00:06:48.570> s<00:06:48.720> adjust<00:06:49.590> your<00:06:49.770> volumes<00:06:50.220> yeah<00:06:51.060> if<00:06:51.210> I

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
XLR s adjust your volumes yeah if I

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.330 
XLR s adjust your volumes yeah if I
adjust<00:06:51.840> my<00:06:51.900> volumes<00:06:52.410> I<00:06:52.590> try<00:06:52.830> to<00:06:52.890> aim<00:06:53.100> at

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
adjust my volumes I try to aim at

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.570 
adjust my volumes I try to aim at
three-quarters<00:06:54.060> of<00:06:54.300> little<00:06:54.630> scale<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.140> got

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
three-quarters of little scale you got

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.860 
three-quarters of little scale you got
because<00:06:56.580> it<00:06:57.030> leaves<00:06:57.240> a<00:06:57.360> little<00:06:57.540> bit<00:06:57.690> of

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
because it leaves a little bit of

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.230 
because it leaves a little bit of
headroom<00:06:58.020> and<00:06:58.290> if<00:06:58.980> you<00:06:59.070> don't<00:06:59.340> a<00:06:59.490> nap<00:06:59.640> and<00:06:59.790> I<00:07:00.120> am

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
headroom and if you don't a nap and I am

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.620 
headroom and if you don't a nap and I am
a<00:07:00.270> bit<00:07:00.570> louder<00:07:00.840> it<00:07:01.170> will<00:07:01.290> be

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
a bit louder it will be

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920 
sound not just a little meter because

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.010 
sound not just a little meter because
you<00:07:21.040> can<00:07:21.190> see<00:07:21.490> the<00:07:21.640> sound<00:07:21.880> coming<00:07:22.150> in<00:07:22.390> but<00:07:22.870> you

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
you can see the sound coming in but you

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.410 
you can see the sound coming in but you
don't<00:07:23.230> hear<00:07:23.680> if<00:07:23.920> there<00:07:24.340> is<00:07:24.460> distortion<00:07:24.940> or

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420 
don't hear if there is distortion or

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.530 
don't hear if there is distortion or
fuzz<00:07:26.260> or<00:07:26.530> whatever<00:07:26.920> right<00:07:28.050> so<00:07:29.050> I<00:07:29.350> think<00:07:30.540> that

fuzz or whatever right so I think that

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.090 
fuzz or whatever right so I think that
pretty<00:07:31.810> much<00:07:32.490> concludes<00:07:33.490> our<00:07:34.180> yeah<00:07:34.960> yeah<00:07:35.830> yeah
