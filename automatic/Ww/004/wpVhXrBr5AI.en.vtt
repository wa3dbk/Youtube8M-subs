00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
weight I didn't know where to go from

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.039 
weight I didn't know where to go from
there<00:01:27.710> because<00:01:28.580> you're<00:01:29.360> no<00:01:29.510> longer<00:01:29.630> doing<00:01:29.930> the

45 minutes whatever it may be took walks

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.550 
45 minutes whatever it may be took walks
during<00:01:58.100> my<00:01:58.340> lunch<00:01:58.610> break<00:01:58.729> or<00:01:59.360> breaks<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.530> I

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
during my lunch break or breaks that I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.950 
during my lunch break or breaks that I
have<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.979> work<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.670> now<00:02:02.330> I'm<00:02:02.510> just<00:02:02.690> going<00:02:02.810> to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
have it work and now I'm just going to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.160 
have it work and now I'm just going to
waste<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.979> by<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:05.060> know<00:02:05.180> eating<00:02:05.780> something

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
waste it by you know eating something

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.800 
waste it by you know eating something
that's<00:02:06.760> going<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.850> make<00:02:08.330> me<00:02:08.390> gain<00:02:08.780> weight

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
that's going to make me gain weight

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.370 
that's going to make me gain weight
that's<00:02:09.470> not<00:02:09.649> very<00:02:09.800> nutritious<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.630> that's<00:02:12.140> how

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that's not very nutritious so that's how

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.550 
that's not very nutritious so that's how
I<00:02:12.610> basically<00:02:13.610> control<00:02:14.360> myself<00:02:14.510> back<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I basically control myself back and and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.760 
I basically control myself back and and

I was eating battling so if I eat that

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.940 
I was eating battling so if I eat that
way<00:04:33.260> once<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.770> month<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.840> I'm<00:04:36.470> able<00:04:36.650> to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
way once a month and and I'm able to

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
discipline myself and go back on on my

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.480 
discipline myself and go back on on my
menu<00:04:39.920> plan<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:41.360> that's<00:04:41.630> wonderful<00:04:42.170> and<00:04:42.830> I

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
menu plan I think that's wonderful and I

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.470 
menu plan I think that's wonderful and I
also<00:04:44.380> because<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.470> get<00:04:45.650> full<00:04:46.040> faster<00:04:46.730> I'm<00:04:47.150> not

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
also because I get full faster I'm not

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.840 
also because I get full faster I'm not
going<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.720> be<00:04:47.870> eating<00:04:48.230> as<00:04:48.500> much<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.370> pizza

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
going to be eating as much of the pizza

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.230 
going to be eating as much of the pizza
whereas<00:04:50.390> before<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:51.290> kid<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.310> not<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.850> could<00:04:52.940> eat

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
whereas before I kid you not I could eat

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.350 
whereas before I kid you not I could eat
a<00:04:53.270> small<00:04:53.540> or<00:04:54.050> medium<00:04:54.440> pizza<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.220> by<00:04:55.880> myself

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
a small or medium pizza and by myself

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.500 
a small or medium pizza and by myself
now<00:04:57.140> i<00:04:57.560> will<00:04:57.950> probably<00:04:58.280> be<00:04:58.400> eating<00:04:58.550> one<00:04:59.180> piece

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
now i will probably be eating one piece

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.430 
now i will probably be eating one piece
of<00:05:00.320> pizza<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.250> get<00:05:01.520> full<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.390> i<00:05:02.660> think<00:05:03.020> that's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
of pizza and get full so i think that's

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.590 
of pizza and get full so i think that's
the<00:05:03.740> difference<00:05:03.980> i<00:05:04.370> because<00:05:04.670> i<00:05:04.790> don't<00:05:05.210> believe

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
the difference i because i don't believe

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.630 
the difference i because i don't believe
it<00:05:05.900> for<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.410> rest<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.800> your<00:05:06.920> life<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.430> should

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
it for the rest of your life you should

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.790 
it for the rest of your life you should
never<00:05:08.000> have<00:05:08.330> tacos<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:08.990> should<00:05:09.170> never<00:05:09.470> have

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
never have tacos you should never have

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.170 
never have tacos you should never have
pizza<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:11.120> i<00:05:11.150> just<00:05:11.690> think<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:13.160> eat<00:05:13.940> every

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
pizza so i just think that you eat every

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.680 
pizza so i just think that you eat every
two<00:05:14.450> hours<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:15.470> do<00:05:16.010> your<00:05:16.130> menu<00:05:16.460> plan<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:17.360> eat

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
two hours you do your menu plan you eat

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.720 
two hours you do your menu plan you eat
right<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:20.030> then<00:05:20.600> one<00:05:21.140> day<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.320> month<00:05:21.500> i

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
right and and then one day a month i

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.930 
right and and then one day a month i
really<00:05:22.730> really<00:05:22.940> think<00:05:23.090> after<00:05:23.690> 60<00:05:24.230> days<00:05:24.260> I

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
really really think after 60 days I

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.550 
really really think after 60 days I
I don't<00:05:25.240> think<00:05:25.300> within<00:05:25.630> those<00:05:25.870> 60<00:05:26.230> days<00:05:26.380> you

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
I don't think within those 60 days you

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560 
I don't think within those 60 days you
should<00:05:26.620> do<00:05:26.890> that<00:05:26.920> because<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:27.790> want<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.300> build

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
should do that because you want to build

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.470 
should do that because you want to build
a<00:05:28.750> habit<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.410> eating<00:05:30.040> every<00:05:30.430> two<00:05:30.460> hours<00:05:30.730> and

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
a habit of eating every two hours and
