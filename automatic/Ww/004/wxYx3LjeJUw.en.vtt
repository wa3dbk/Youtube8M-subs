reason why we have been sustained and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.580

maintained in a nation that seems to be
falling<00:00:43.890> apart<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.090> Prayer<00:00:45.980> in

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
about we've taken off 13 zeros and just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.100 
about we've taken off 13 zeros and just
before<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.930> left<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.680> another<00:01:31.740> six

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.920 
before we left you to go for another six
unofficially<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.619> altogether<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.280> lost

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.520 
unofficially so altogether we have lost
19<00:01:36.930> zeros<00:01:37.829> after<00:01:38.189> our<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.229> how

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
19 zeros after our one so that's how

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
19 zeros after our one so that's how
much<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> United<00:01:41.850> States<00:01:42.119> dollar

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.800 
much it is to the United States dollar
if<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:43.470> did<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.100> church<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.090> Zimbabwe

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
if we did not have a church in Zimbabwe

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.160 
if we did not have a church in Zimbabwe
that<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.200> praying<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.540> do<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.780> believe<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Zimbabwe would still be wait is I think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.899 
Zimbabwe would still be wait is I think
we<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.750> erupted<00:01:52.530> long<00:01:53.159> ago<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.610> some

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
we would have erupted long ago in some

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.719 
we would have erupted long ago in some
sort<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> servile<00:01:54.899> disturbance<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.460> the
