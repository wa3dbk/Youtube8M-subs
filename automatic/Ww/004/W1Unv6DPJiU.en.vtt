number<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.510> try<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> create<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.440> sense<00:00:37.739> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
number two try to create a sense of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
number two try to create a sense of
depth<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> dimension<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.570> pictures<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
depth and dimension in your pictures in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
depth and dimension in your pictures in
other<00:00:40.500> words<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> world<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.730> three

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
other words we see the world in three

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
other words we see the world in three
dimensions<00:00:42.480> height<00:00:42.870> width<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> depth<00:00:44.250> but

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
dimensions height width and depth but

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.610 
dimensions height width and depth but
our<00:00:44.789> cameras<00:00:45.210> only<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:46.079> dimensions

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
our cameras only see two dimensions

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.100 
our cameras only see two dimensions
height<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> width<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> our<00:00:48.210> job<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.780> try

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
height and width so it's our job to try

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.350 
height and width so it's our job to try
to<00:00:49.230> create<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.559> sense<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.980> depth<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> do

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to create a sense of depth one way to do

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
to create a sense of depth one way to do
that<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> foreground<00:00:52.739> element

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that is to use the foreground element

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
that is to use the foreground element
when<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.730> composing<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> scene<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
when we're composing the scene like this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
when we're composing the scene like this
a<00:00:55.050> landscape<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> rock<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a landscape so we have that rock in the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
a landscape so we have that rock in the
foreground<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.320> mid<00:00:58.530> ground

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
foreground we have these mid ground

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099 
foreground we have these mid ground
rocks<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.120> beautiful<00:01:00.180> rocks

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
rocks and we have these beautiful rocks

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
rocks and we have these beautiful rocks
in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> background<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.489> my

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
in the background so that's my

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
in the background so that's my
composition<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.930> everything<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
composition to get everything in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
composition to get everything in the
scene<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.100> focus<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
scene in focus what I'm gonna do is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.940 
scene in focus what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> took<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually what I did when I took the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.039 
actually what I did when I took the
picture<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> focus<00:01:09.270> lock<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.869> my

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
picture is I use the focus lock on my

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
picture is I use the focus lock on my
camera<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.189> focus<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.880> third<00:01:12.150> into

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
camera I like to focus one third into

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
camera I like to focus one third into
the<00:01:12.540> scene<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.380> recomposed<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.640> shot

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the scene that I recomposed and I shot

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
the scene that I recomposed and I shot
so<00:01:15.330> remember<00:01:15.900> try<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> create<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> sense<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so remember try to create a sense of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.060 
so remember try to create a sense of
depth<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> dimension<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.180> pictures

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.609 

number<00:01:23.070> three<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> hike<00:01:24.450> actually<00:01:25.259> take<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
number three take a hike actually take a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.310 
number three take a hike actually take a
walk<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.939> location<00:01:27.540> take<00:01:28.080> your

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
walk when you get on location take your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
walk when you get on location take your
time<00:01:28.680> walk<00:01:29.220> around<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.670> subject<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
time walk around the subject look for

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
time walk around the subject look for
all<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> different<00:01:31.110> photo<00:01:31.680> angles<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.460> are

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
all the different photo angles there are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
all the different photo angles there are
a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> different<00:01:33.240> photo<00:01:33.390> angles<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a lot of different photo angles here I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
a lot of different photo angles here I
found<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> best<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.400> remember<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> get

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
found the best so remember when you get

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
found the best so remember when you get
on<00:01:36.509> location<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> walk<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> take<00:01:38.340> your

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
on location take a walk and take your

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.319 
on location take a walk and take your
time

number four always look down always look

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
number four always look down always look
back<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.030> always<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.710> many

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
back and always look up you know so many

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
back and always look up you know so many
people<00:01:47.040> miss<00:01:47.610> great<00:01:48.090> picture<00:01:48.479> opportunities

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
people miss great picture opportunities

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
people miss great picture opportunities
because<00:01:49.409> they're<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.649> such<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> hurry<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> get

because they're in such a hurry to get

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
because they're in such a hurry to get
to<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> final<00:01:51.210> location<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:51.990> miss<00:01:52.229> what's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to the final location they miss what's
