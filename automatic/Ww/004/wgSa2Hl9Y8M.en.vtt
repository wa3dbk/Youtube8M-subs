00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 century of something like 2 years only 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.920
 to see it 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 I was really looking forward to seeing him there 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 lots of people who want to go see 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 the one seen the trailer but who is it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 that we will never see this crap 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.610
 and instead it seems the same to the fantastic 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 people who have done coral in have 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 worked here too the beginning is fantastic 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 because prefectural like a green house 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.090
 movie also the greenhouse eb narranti 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.570
 noe rodriguez started the same way 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.460
 with that background of all the music that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
 then tarantino made it his but that one 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 actually it was like starting Iberians 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.270
 lautner panels starts seeing a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 b movie horror film precisely indeed 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
 you see roi microphones from above the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.989
 the actress who is particularly change 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 the skin of this fantastic film 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.590
 you even sell rosy around 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.780
 nose you see the light that you see 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 the transparency of the ear if to see 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the teacher as a rule that even 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 there are things like coagulated blood 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.790
 and since the people for the balls of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.070
 some people here are red or there 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 they make small pieces of hour of the pieces 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 and even white especially when 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.259
 it pushes on the skin is fantastic there is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 another quote there is a certain point there 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.009
 zombie who loses an arm and sticks 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.619
 on the face in the same way as 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 the monsters of aliens attacked there 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.790
 I really boast so many quotes 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 norman ceramic that makes music the most 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 by apocalypse now 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.640
 instead there is the scene from the van when 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.220
 however cv 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.440
 Car fears are precisely when 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.200
 identical to those of an action movie 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 as if we were mediating speed and the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.440
 end it seems almost misfortune you remember 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.619
 when he parked after 10 thousand for i 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.970
 vertices perfect parking roma so le 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.039
 very funny scenes instead of that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.630
 of dressing distributor licenses 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.790
 chased by the interior but does not want to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.560
 lose his potatoes even a whole 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.540
 how the people react to the arrival of the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 zombies that we are studies that escape 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.510
 europa so no we often see in the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.970
 red and green or magenta light films 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.450
 and greens that would be on average i 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.850
 colors of the 3d glasses those there 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.360
 of the data with a green lens a lens 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.760
 red 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.440
 There are various types of various colors 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.050
 they also launch a letter is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.930
 practically what was used above all 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.790
 so for horror movies it is 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 fantastic as they are home town far 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.840
 to see materially that kind of 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 glasses also use movements of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.900
 typical machine of horror movies like it 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 zoom and close up of the pass from here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.100
 very fast to create your own tension 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.910
 the final titles are fantastic because 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.579
 I know how the posters of the 50's and 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.370
 they are beautiful for what they are made of 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.160
 i'm not the classics, my members are finished 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.560
 or beat filming Whereas 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.910
 a stop motion movie is very much 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 nice because they are really the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.760
 preemption almost to beautiful even the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.470
 what they see is fantastic 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.940
 film surprised me a lot because 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.640
 honestly I thought it was a little more 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.120
 only for children instead it seems 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.180
 there is this strand that is really a lot 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.650
 dark ie if obviously for children for 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.630
 there was also live children who 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.700
 they were even afraid of going out 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.660
 the cinema of what this film is about 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.760
 talk about norman who sees the dead 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.280
 no one even believes his guns and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.010
 everyone believes it 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.260
 a loser and an idiot his uncle a madman 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.990
 Peacock tells him that he was the chosen one 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.319
 to do something read a book on 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.360
 on the grave of the witch the bright series 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.360
 colors that where he lives his 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.400
 town a bit like the fairy tales they give 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.150
 always a moral meaning here I have 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 found very very nice just because 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.410
 he knows how to do it for children there were also the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.300
 children who saw to die other than 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.579
 mum says this course is pretty cool 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.769
 the verbal story is crazy veiled 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.109
 which makes people laugh as they can understand 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.150
 children but it is very problematic as 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:29.790
 cardboard for example there is the crowd that was 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.460
 typical crazy crowd that repeats on 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.910
 screen on arrival of years and the same 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.470
 what happened to the overall string is 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.830
 parsa we hang the same 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.120
 advisers why it repeats could 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.340
 to be also a small of cyanco rosat 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.580
 on the crowd on the mechanisms i 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.140
 the mechanisms of the crowd in fact finally has 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.510
 guy who says no no but I haven't been 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.580
 I did the others to do it 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.800
 they pushed that he has some plastic 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 what when things happen 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.150
 terrible and unforgivable that it always is 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.460
 the fault of the map even if it was 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.000
 part of that mass but the thing that you 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.120
 really upset but really a 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.070
 was a sentence the policewoman said 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.210
 there are the people who are going to 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.890
 kill the zombie rice they want 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.000
 destroy then kill a cola 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.120
 literally going crazy is 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.729
 uncontrollable and there is someone who shoots 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.610
 at that moment the policewoman says not 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.520
 you can only hope the police can 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.289
 shoot civilians 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.620
 I remained there entrusted euro said 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.760
 fuck you make out 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.910
 if we get there we have a movie for 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.910
 children 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.440
 cabbage is a lot is a simple sentence though 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.520
 can be read 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.650
 last of different even in very ways 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.450
 subversives that we remember another one pil 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.840
 in cartoon for children 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.620
 I don't know if TV would have put the situation 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.360
 such 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.280
 in these cartoons matisse and there was the 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.930
 child who was put aside 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.880
 it all ended let's see that 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.680
 the child was really good and there he was 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.510
 to be one of the idiots who were not 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.080
 you realize because maybe they will be saved 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.110
 the idea him 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.820
 here is a much more complex discussion 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.220
 especially on the crowd on what he has 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.340
 made to the witch and we imagine the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.980
 historic imprint alive as people do 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.770
 imagine someone when I want 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.550
 idealize the current even 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.550
 scapegoat 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.850
 and then we find out she was a child 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.220
 really beautiful and complex I will you 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.590
 I advise why it was ok maybe they were 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.970
 matters for this little brother is a 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:51.100
 movies for children but really really 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.550
 with goodies and buttarelli for 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.100
 adults so it's interesting and then does 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:01.120
 well like any new where one 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.790
 crowd something barbaric like the one who goes 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.890
 back in the time of civilization to 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.400
 end pretends nothing you want is not 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:13.530
 success nothing is in the final is nice 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:17.380
 because we see also literally norm 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:20.380
 also accepted by his family is the 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:23.470
 final scene as the beginning is just that 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.360
 they are all together therefore parents not 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.730
 they only understood but accepted it 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.900
 they try to enter his world like this 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.460
 like her sister 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.500
 I hope you like it and I hope you don't 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.960
 face related to me that I am destroyed e 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.960
 the quarrel sound I still have to hurt bye
