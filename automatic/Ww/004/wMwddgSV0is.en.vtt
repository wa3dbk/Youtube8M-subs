00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:12.659
 according to martÃ­n 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.539
 we are in better and this is without accessories first I will answer to 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.560
 selina that asks me what is the cause of the hike in rentals first 

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:25.470
 the obvious the less alternatives you have of something later it will come out be it 

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.469
 he wants girl so fucking life what is the problem 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.739
 that a young man who needs to leave the nest has only two options a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.739
 hacker shopping a house they have nothing 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.300
 It's worth it for the center I know about that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.520
 help at any cost is less than that of a mortgage forget together with more 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.660
 people of the first option we draw the conclusion that rents 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 They need to be less than the mortgage but not much 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 the second option is even more sad and by segmenting the rent payment 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 between several people each of them has the possibility of paying more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.830
 money 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.979
 therefore the offer stops 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.159
 at the maximum point that each individual can pay being the sum of these 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 individuals always mazorqueros of a single person would be willing to pay 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.010
 and enough please because this is getting very serious what to do in a 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.800
 free economy offer alternatives I did not see cash you remember 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 wink the eye but via low-cost rental housing that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.350
 compel competitors to match or improve their offer to something else 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.510
 the game warned not to come with what they say and children killed in the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.630
 last two years 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.369
 has been placed on the investor tape in Spain with only two investments 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.670
 purchase of orizonia lantigua trips iberia for 950 million euros and the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.850
 second was the acquisition of the pepi luci certification firm for which 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.460
 disbursed 1500 million euros with a couple to see if we follow the example of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.520
 this company and we intelligently invest here that if 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.570
