00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.529
 today's cinemas are something new about today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.150
 the server we played on 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.130
 or on the raccoon 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.750

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.050

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.050
 the intro 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello the most important first of the g7 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.450

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.860
 you know we hit it 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.400
 so we can play there regulated 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.820
 I say 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.830
 and this whitelist will be removed now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.919
 that means each one of you can barn 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.470
 and I want you there the ip as well as the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.850
 Tell tsa ip because you find it 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.400
 be server today where we will be later 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 play on it again 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.970
 and there is the whitelist then 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 First off we stay testing times 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.740
 watching how people look at each other 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 keep to the rules and so on and on 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.730
 yes, that means you can feel like it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 look alpi as I said, and esp are the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 description and yes that should be a lot 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 run better than in the recordings the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 you have seen 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.920
 meanwhile, are advanced root 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.330
 server and no longer takes over radio 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.689
 and only you know that the software 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.780
 Just the ip stop as it kids on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.100
 Enter best and play strauss 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 nice if you stick to the rules 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 and so on the daysailer I know 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 not if I missed anything but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.270
 apparently not so much new 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 I have always received that there are three 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.390
 New vehicles will last for the last time 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.010
 said there is a new vehicle 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.030
 would buy three new ones 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.980
 give vehicles 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 you know them all too 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.400
 first I chose last time 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.550
 the camp ii was still pulling here 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 times and then probably the bus is the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.620
 you already gone out of fashion the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 ikarus 260 and the gez volga also already 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.080
 out of fashion these vehicles will be fine 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.350

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.360

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.010
 otherwise that's it again 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.570
 with the news far very short otherwise 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.130
 Now there's a bit of interaction 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.960

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.340
