his<00:00:21.900> toes<00:00:22.289> weren't<00:00:22.590> pointed<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.490> his<00:00:23.699> toes<00:00:23.880> are

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
his toes weren't pointed so his toes are

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.189 
his toes weren't pointed so his toes are
pointing<00:00:24.300> down<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> bottom<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
bottom of the pool and that meant that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
bottom of the pool and that meant that
his<00:00:27.689> legs<00:00:27.990> were<00:00:28.109> dropping<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
his legs were dropping and then the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.470 
his legs were dropping and then the
second<00:00:29.609> thing<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> he<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:29.970> doing<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.390> was

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
second thing that he was doing it was

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.179 
second thing that he was doing it was
bending<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.019> hips<00:00:31.109> rather<00:00:31.890> than<00:00:32.009> being

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
bending at the hips rather than being

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
bending at the hips rather than being
straight<00:00:32.640> through<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> hips<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.630> also

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
straight through the hips so we also

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
straight through the hips so we also
worked<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> very

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
worked on that and then so the very

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
worked on that and then so the very
first<00:00:35.610> drill<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.329> worked<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> was

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
first drill that we worked on it was

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
first drill that we worked on it was
kicking<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> board<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> front<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
kicking with the board at the front and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.020 
kicking with the board at the front and
we<00:00:39.780> made<00:00:39.960> him<00:00:40.140> point<00:00:40.379> his<00:00:40.469> toes<00:00:40.739> down<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
we made him point his toes down so it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.459 
we made him point his toes down so it
was<00:00:42.180> streamlining<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> rest<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.200> his<00:00:43.260> body

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
was streamlining the rest of his body

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
was streamlining the rest of his body
and<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.340> also<00:00:44.489> made<00:00:44.879> him<00:00:45.000> tilt<00:00:45.270> his<00:00:45.390> hips

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and we also made him tilt his hips

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
and we also made him tilt his hips
slightly<00:00:45.899> backwards<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.039> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
slightly backwards like you would in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
slightly backwards like you would in
Pilates<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> squeezes<00:00:48.570> glutes<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.260> he<00:00:49.379> was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Pilates and squeezes glutes so he was

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229 
Pilates and squeezes glutes so he was
straight<00:00:49.800> through<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> body<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:51.059> meant

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
straight through the body and that meant

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
straight through the body and that meant
he<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.420> sending<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> whole<00:00:51.899> lot<00:00:52.110> higher<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
he was sending a whole lot higher in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
he was sending a whole lot higher in the
water<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.510> first

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
your technique athletes are like a light

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
your technique athletes are like a light
switch<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.570> their<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.229> they're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
switch they have their on and they're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
switch they have their on and they're
off<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.820> athlete<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.630> their

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
off so when an athlete is on their

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
off so when an athlete is on their
training<00:01:31.619> hard<00:01:31.829> they're<00:01:32.340> working<00:01:32.579> hard<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
training hard they're working hard and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
training hard they're working hard and
they're<00:01:33.600> eating<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.140> things<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they're eating the right things but

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.399 
they're eating the right things but
athletes<00:01:35.490> also<00:01:35.790> having<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.329> we're<00:01:37.020> usually

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
athletes also having off we're usually

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
athletes also having off we're usually
the<00:01:37.650> first<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:38.159> weeks<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.490> their<00:01:38.670> offseason

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the first two weeks of their offseason

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
the first two weeks of their offseason
they<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:39.960> eat<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.680> should

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
they will eat more than they should

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
they will eat more than they should
they'll<00:01:41.460> exercise<00:01:42.030> less<00:01:42.299> than<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.600> should

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they'll exercise less than they should

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
they'll exercise less than they should
and<00:01:43.020> they'll<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> sitting<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> house

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and they'll be sitting around the house

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
and they'll be sitting around the house
on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> couch<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.420> doing<00:01:45.689> anything<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
on the couch not doing anything and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
on the couch not doing anything and
that's<00:01:46.770> okay<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.939> gives<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> an

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's okay because that gives you an

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's okay because that gives you an
understanding<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.979> feel

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
understanding of what it's like to feel

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
understanding of what it's like to feel
that<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.180> gives<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.780> desire<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that way so it gives you more desire to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.830 
that way so it gives you more desire to
want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.009> able<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.180> top<00:01:54.450> level

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
want to be able to get to that top level

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
want to be able to get to that top level
of<00:01:54.990> fitness<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.560> training<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> okay<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
of fitness and training so it's okay to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.520 
of fitness and training so it's okay to
have<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.450> off<00:01:57.540> phase<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.259> training

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
have an off phase in your training

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160 
have an off phase in your training
because<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.790> hard<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> maintain<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.930> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
because it's hard to maintain that on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
because it's hard to maintain that on
for<00:02:01.799> an<00:02:01.860> entire<00:02:02.130> year<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> best<00:02:03.540> ways

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
for an entire year one of the best ways

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
for an entire year one of the best ways
to<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.619> phase<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.460> create<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to get into your on phase is to create a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
to get into your on phase is to create a
weekly<00:02:06.299> schedule<00:02:06.360> where<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.350> map<00:02:07.530> out<00:02:07.710> what

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
weekly schedule where you map out what

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.859 
weekly schedule where you map out what
training<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.759> each<00:02:09.239> day<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.810> week

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
training you do each day of the week

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.390 
training you do each day of the week
morning<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> night<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
morning and night and then if you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.429 
morning and night and then if you

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
that schedule on your fridge then it's

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.470 
that schedule on your fridge then it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
get clear water and you can get more

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.399 
get clear water and you can get more
from<00:02:55.150> your<00:02:55.239> training<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.019> rather<00:02:56.230> than

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
from your training so rather than

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.110 
from your training so rather than
drafting<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> whole<00:02:57.250> session<00:02:57.489> where

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
drafting for the whole session where

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.149 
drafting for the whole session where
you're<00:02:58.239> working<00:02:58.359> thirty<00:02:58.900> percent<00:02:59.290> easier

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
you're working thirty percent easier

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.399 
you're working thirty percent easier
then<00:03:00.849> push<00:03:01.329> off<00:03:01.540> five<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:01.900> seven<00:03:02.139> seconds

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
then push off five or seven seconds

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.080 
then push off five or seven seconds
behind<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.010> get<00:03:03.250> some<00:03:03.430> clear<00:03:03.639> water<00:03:03.879> to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
behind so you get some clear water to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
behind so you get some clear water to
swim<00:03:04.329> well<00:03:04.569> with<00:03:05.019> better<00:03:05.260> technique<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:05.980> you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
swim well with better technique and you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.920 
swim well with better technique and you
get<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.609> work<00:03:06.790> harder<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.329> session<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.870> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
get to work harder in a session so you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.509 
get to work harder in a session so you
get<00:03:08.200> more<00:03:08.379> from<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.069> find<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> you'll

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
get more from it if you find that you'll

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.280 
get more from it if you find that you'll
constantly<00:03:09.879> saw<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> specific<00:03:10.750> muscle
