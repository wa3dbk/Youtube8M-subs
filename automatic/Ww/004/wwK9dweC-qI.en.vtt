00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
here light up but this light over here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.789 
here light up but this light over here
goes<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> unhook<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.799> hard

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
goes out but when I unhook the hard

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.730 
goes out but when I unhook the hard
drive<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.630> little<00:01:12.630> yellow<00:01:12.780> light<00:01:13.080> won't

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
drive that little yellow light won't

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
drive that little yellow light won't
come<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.189> no<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
come on no more but that one will so I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
come on no more but that one will so I
guess<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.799> hard<00:01:17.040> drive<00:01:17.250> light<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> these

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
guess that's hard drive light and these

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.899 
guess that's hard drive light and these
this<00:01:19.020> hard<00:01:19.259> drive<00:01:19.439> light<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.070> steadily<00:01:20.430> stay

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this hard drive light will steadily stay

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
this hard drive light will steadily stay
on<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> green<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.170> does<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.650> you

and<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.380> stopped<00:02:13.650> working<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.870> I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and this stopped working but I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.500 
and this stopped working but I
disconnected<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> hard<00:02:17.280> drive<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.850> found<00:02:18.300> some

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
disconnected the hard drive I found some

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030 
disconnected the hard drive I found some
kind<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.750> manual<00:02:19.020> online<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.830> something

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
kind of manual online for something

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.490 
kind of manual online for something
similar<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.630> says<00:02:21.840> disconnect

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
similar to do this it says disconnect

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.950 
similar to do this it says disconnect
the<00:02:22.620> hard<00:02:22.860> drive<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.850> power<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> then

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
the hard drive and the power and then

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.990 
the hard drive and the power and then
plug<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> back<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.670> will<00:02:26.850> go

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
plug it back in and see if it will go

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.570 
plug it back in and see if it will go
beyond<00:02:27.650> past<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.010> system

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
beyond past the system

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.630 
beyond past the system
initializing<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.710> doesn't<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> just

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
initializing but it doesn't it just

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.750 
initializing but it doesn't it just
stays<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.180> system<00:02:33.780> initializing<00:02:34.760> whether

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
stays that system initializing whether

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
stays that system initializing whether
the<00:02:35.970> hard<00:02:36.150> drives<00:02:37.670> disconnected<00:02:38.670> or

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the hard drives disconnected or

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.050 
the hard drives disconnected or
connected<00:02:40.200> alright<00:02:41.130> anyway<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> check<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
connected alright anyway I check the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.570 
connected alright anyway I check the
board<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.570> took<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> board<00:02:43.200> out<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.890> turn<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
board I took the board out of it turn it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.280 
board I took the board out of it turn it
upside<00:02:44.910> down<00:02:44.940> yeah<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> couldn't<00:02:45.810> find<00:02:46.020> any

upside down yeah I couldn't find any

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.990 
upside down yeah I couldn't find any
breaks<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.800> couldn't<00:02:47.040> find<00:02:47.220> anything<00:02:47.520> burn
