something<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.140> does<00:01:37.350> happen<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.100> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
something that does happen a lot so in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
something that does happen a lot so in
you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.229> self<00:01:40.530> identity

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you know like what is your self identity

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
you know like what is your self identity
like<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> simplest<00:01:42.180> terms<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
like in like the simplest terms if you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
like in like the simplest terms if you
had<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> pick<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:44.130> dichotomous<00:01:45.060> terms

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
had to pick like three dichotomous terms

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
had to pick like three dichotomous terms
like<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> could<00:01:46.320> add<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.100> yourself<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
like that you could add to yourself I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
like that you could add to yourself I
think<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.119> subscribe<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> mean

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
think you would subscribe to you mean

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.720 
think you would subscribe to you mean
like<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.380> using<00:01:50.070> other<00:01:50.220> people's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
like that using other people's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.450 
like that using other people's
while<00:01:51.360> illiberal<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.320> sure<00:01:52.500> yeah<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.340> got

while illiberal for sure yeah we got

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
while illiberal for sure yeah we got
rather<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.300> is<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
rather because it is something to be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.030 
rather because it is something to be
very<00:01:54.930> proud<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.680> been<00:01:55.800> bastardized

you<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.810> they<00:02:55.170> would<00:02:55.410> they<00:02:55.740> would<00:02:55.770> say<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
you know they would they would say that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.830 
you know they would they would say that
some<00:02:56.760> people<00:02:57.150> there<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:57.480> say<00:02:57.600> they<00:02:57.780> were

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
some people there would say they were

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.480 
some people there would say they were
the<00:02:57.990> best<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.370> just

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
the best but I don't think that just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.699 
the best but I don't think that just
because<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.209> were<00:03:00.360> born<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.810> certainly<00:03:01.410> soul

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
because you were born and certainly soul

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.650 
because you were born and certainly soul
and<00:03:01.920> makes<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.370> better<00:03:02.640> yes<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.510> it's

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and makes you better yes and it's

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.910 
and makes you better yes and it's
probably<00:03:03.900> more<00:03:03.990> constructive<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> part

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
probably more constructive to be a part

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.380 
probably more constructive to be a part
of<00:03:04.950> humanity<00:03:05.220> rather<00:03:05.610> than<00:03:05.700> yeah<00:03:05.940> country

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
of humanity rather than yeah country

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.300 
of humanity rather than yeah country
definitely<00:03:07.080> me<00:03:07.410> because<00:03:07.620> we're<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> same

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
definitely me because we're all the same

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.280 
definitely me because we're all the same
boat<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.850> regard<00:03:09.150> right<00:03:09.510> well<00:03:09.750> we<00:03:09.840> are<00:03:09.959> we

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
there's what bites there's a lot of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.530 
there's what bites there's a lot of
outdoor<00:03:59.040> involved<00:03:59.430> with<00:03:59.520> them<00:03:59.640> alcohol<00:04:00.060> acts

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
outdoor involved with them alcohol acts

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.660 
outdoor involved with them alcohol acts
I<00:04:00.690> think<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.140> lot<00:04:01.290> but<00:04:01.440> identity<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.160> ya

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I think that is a lot but identity to ya

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.070 
I think that is a lot but identity to ya
know<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.300> absolutely<00:04:03.510> i<00:04:03.750> think<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:04.050> of

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
know I think absolutely i think one of

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.540 
know I think absolutely i think one of
the<00:04:04.200> most<00:04:04.350> unbelievable<00:04:04.590> things<00:04:05.100> when<00:04:05.310> people

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
the most unbelievable things when people

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.880 
the most unbelievable things when people
actually<00:04:05.700> find<00:04:06.420> ways<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.780> transcend<00:04:07.320> unity

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
actually find ways to transcend unity

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.260 
actually find ways to transcend unity
that's<00:04:08.070> really<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.550> when<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.790> bring<00:04:08.970> items

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that's really like when you bring items

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.760 
that's really like when you bring items
together<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.810> mean<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.260> more<00:04:10.440> value<00:04:10.560> in

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
together I mean there's more value in

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.440 
together I mean there's more value in
that<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.250> mean<00:04:11.430> especially<00:04:11.850> when<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.209> look<00:04:12.360> at

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
that I mean especially when you look at

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
that I mean especially when you look at
like<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.600> political<00:04:13.020> system<00:04:13.320> where

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
like a political system where

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.890 
like a political system where
transcending<00:04:14.220> those<00:04:14.430> bounds<00:04:14.940> would<00:04:15.570> probably

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
transcending those bounds would probably

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.360 
transcending those bounds would probably
make<00:04:15.959> things<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.410> mean<00:04:16.680> ten<00:04:17.100> times<00:04:17.280> more

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
make things I mean ten times more

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.069 
make things I mean ten times more
constructive<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> human<00:04:18.570> nature<00:04:18.870> will

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
constructive we have a human nature will

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.530 
constructive we have a human nature will
allow<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.680> mean<00:04:20.669> actually<00:04:21.060> there<00:04:21.209> are<00:04:21.359> some

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
allow it I mean actually there are some

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.450 
allow it I mean actually there are some
people<00:04:21.690> who<00:04:21.930> absolutely<00:04:22.160> arrangers<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.280> want

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
people who absolutely arrangers I want

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.920 
people who absolutely arrangers I want
admit<00:04:23.760> that's<00:04:24.030> human<00:04:24.300> nature<00:04:24.330> though<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
admit that's human nature though a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.570 
admit that's human nature though a
little<00:04:25.230> unfortunate<00:04:25.650> that's<00:04:25.890> neuroscience

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
little unfortunate that's neuroscience

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.010 
little unfortunate that's neuroscience
really<00:04:27.090> that's<00:04:27.330> just<00:04:27.390> that's<00:04:27.750> brain

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
really that's just that's brain

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.630 
really that's just that's brain
chemistry<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.530> not<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.040> itself<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.460> bad
