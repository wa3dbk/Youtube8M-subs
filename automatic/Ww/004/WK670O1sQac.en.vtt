00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
of a medium medium heat you can cook it
even<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.520> hotter<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.450> you've<00:01:54.600> got

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
even a little bit hotter but you've got

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
even a little bit hotter but you've got
to<00:01:54.990> stand<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.340> sure<00:01:56.399> doesn't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to stand over it and make sure doesn't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
to stand over it and make sure doesn't
burn<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> high

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
burn if you're going to go with a high

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
burn if you're going to go with a high
heat<00:01:58.500> otherwise<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.729> medium<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> medium-low

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
heat otherwise the medium to medium-low

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
heat otherwise the medium to medium-low
and<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.350> let<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> cook<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> while<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and just let it cook for a while and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
and just let it cook for a while and
they<00:02:03.329> will<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.780> reduce<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> get

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
they will actually reduce down and get

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.540 
they will actually reduce down and get
caramelized<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.069> ginger

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
caramelized so I put a little ginger

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.630 
caramelized so I put a little ginger
garlic<00:02:08.819> paste<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:10.640> tablespoon

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
garlic paste in there about a tablespoon

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.720 
garlic paste in there about a tablespoon
or<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
or so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.800 
or so
the<00:02:14.730> eggplant<00:02:15.540> were<00:02:17.150> after<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> slice<00:02:18.569> them

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the eggplant were after I slice them

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.610 
the eggplant were after I slice them
they<00:02:19.019> soaked<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.800> water<00:02:20.220> for<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.819> few<00:02:21.060> hours<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
they soaked in water for a few hours so

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740 
they soaked in water for a few hours so
they're<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.190> quite<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.580> dry<00:02:24.030> now

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
they're just not quite as dry now

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.400 
they're just not quite as dry now
they're<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.330> large<00:02:27.330> pan<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.050> they're<00:02:28.170> going

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
they're in a large pan and they're going

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.640 
they're in a large pan and they're going
to<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:29.299> lightly<00:02:30.299> roast<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.140> same<00:02:31.379> way<00:02:31.500> we

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to just lightly roast the same way we

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.470 
to just lightly roast the same way we
did<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.860> onions<00:02:32.310> kind<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.819> medium<00:02:33.239> heat

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
did the onions kind of a medium heat

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.650 
did the onions kind of a medium heat
medium<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.200> high<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.879> starts<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> pan

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
medium to high if it starts that the pan

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.270 
medium to high if it starts that the pan
starts<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.049> dry<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> little<00:02:37.650> I'll<00:02:38.069> just

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
starts to dry out a little I'll just

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.559 
starts to dry out a little I'll just
simply<00:02:38.430> add<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.330> way<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
simply add a little bit of one way to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.380 
simply add a little bit of one way to
accelerate<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.470> cooking<00:02:40.970> on<00:02:41.970> these<00:02:42.150> things

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
accelerate the cooking on these things

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.509 
accelerate the cooking on these things
is<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.810> put<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> lid<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.349> pan<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.799> that

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
is just to put a lid on the pan and that

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.130 
is just to put a lid on the pan and that
will<00:02:44.670> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.030> steam<00:02:45.360> them<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> little<00:02:46.019> bit

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
will kind of steam them a little bit

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.559 
will kind of steam them a little bit
faster<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.940> here's<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> onions<00:02:48.390> they've

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
faster so here's the onions they've

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.210 
faster so here's the onions they've
browned<00:02:48.900> quite<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.349> bit<00:02:49.709> they're<00:02:49.980> very

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
browned quite a bit they're very

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
browned quite a bit they're very
caramelized<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.209> certainly<00:02:51.540> don't<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
caramelized you certainly don't have to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.289 
caramelized you certainly don't have to
do<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.489> could<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.760> them<00:02:53.880> you

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
do it like that you could have them you

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.720 
do it like that you could have them you
know<00:02:54.420> mostly<00:02:54.810> raw<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.349> wanted<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> like

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
know mostly raw if you wanted but I like

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.809 
know mostly raw if you wanted but I like
them<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.329> like<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.599> taste<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
them like this I like the taste with the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.270 
them like this I like the taste with the
eggplant<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.890> starting<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.920> roast

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
eggplant now this is starting to roast

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.630 
eggplant now this is starting to roast
as<00:03:02.549> well<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.660> kind<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.110> constant<00:03:04.680> battle

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
as well it's kind of a constant battle

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.850 
as well it's kind of a constant battle
without<00:03:06.239> oil<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.709> get<00:03:08.340> them<00:03:08.610> roasted

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
without oil in here to get them roasted

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
without oil in here to get them roasted
without<00:03:10.860> burning<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.519> bottom<00:03:11.879> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> pan

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
without burning the bottom of the pan

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.170 
without burning the bottom of the pan
and<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.890> turning<00:03:14.250> quite<00:03:14.519> Brown<00:03:14.879> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and so this is turning quite Brown and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.090 
and so this is turning quite Brown and
I'll<00:03:15.269> I'll<00:03:15.870> just<00:03:16.049> keep<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.440> adding<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.950> little

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
I'll I'll just keep on adding a little

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.339 
I'll I'll just keep on adding a little
bit<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.400> water

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.589 

and<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> prevent<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.480> from

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
and that's going to prevent it from

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.750 
and that's going to prevent it from
actually<00:03:25.140> burning<00:03:25.469> but<00:03:26.250> they're<00:03:26.430> slowly

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
actually burning but they're slowly

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
actually burning but they're slowly
roasting<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:27.659> you<00:03:28.049> have<00:03:28.170> too<00:03:28.439> much<00:03:28.620> water

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
roasting if you have too much water

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.089 
roasting if you have too much water
they'll<00:03:29.430> cook<00:03:29.969> but<00:03:30.900> they'll<00:03:31.349> be<00:03:31.530> sort<00:03:31.950> of

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
they'll cook but they'll be sort of

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.520 
they'll cook but they'll be sort of
soggy<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.670> though<00:03:32.909> they<00:03:33.030> were<00:03:33.090> boiled<00:03:33.530> rather

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
soggy as though they were boiled rather

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.420 
soggy as though they were boiled rather
than<00:03:34.920> kind<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.909> roasted<00:03:36.359> or<00:03:36.480> fried<00:03:36.599> taste

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
than kind of the roasted or fried taste

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.460 
than kind of the roasted or fried taste
but<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.970> way<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.720> slow<00:03:39.959> roasting

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
but this this way with the slow roasting

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.780 
but this this way with the slow roasting
I<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:40.890> tastes<00:03:41.760> pretty<00:03:42.090> closely<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I think tastes pretty closely to the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.750 
I think tastes pretty closely to the
traditional<00:03:45.420> Chinese<00:03:45.900> dish<00:03:46.129> you<00:03:47.129> could<00:03:47.400> also

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
traditional Chinese dish you could also

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.429 
traditional Chinese dish you could also
bake<00:03:48.120> them<00:03:48.359> in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.599> oven<00:03:48.689> but<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.989> takes<00:03:52.319> a

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
bake them in the oven but that takes a

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.979 
bake them in the oven but that takes a
lot<00:03:52.590> longer<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.189> it's<00:03:54.150> kind<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.420> hot<00:03:54.689> here<00:03:54.900> in
