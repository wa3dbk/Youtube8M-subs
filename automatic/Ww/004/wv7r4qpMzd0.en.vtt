is<00:00:44.000> actually<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.750> 32-bit<00:00:45.680> ARM<00:00:45.920> Cortex

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
is actually a 32-bit ARM Cortex

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.049 
is actually a 32-bit ARM Cortex
processor<00:00:47.420> with<00:00:47.899> 128<00:00:48.559> K<00:00:48.860> of<00:00:49.040> memory<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.000> you

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
processor with 128 K of memory so you

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.549 
processor with 128 K of memory so you
know<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.270> think<00:00:50.360> Coolermaster<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.290> kind<00:00:51.500> of

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
know I think Coolermaster is kind of

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.350 
know I think Coolermaster is kind of
like<00:00:51.680> hey<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:51.860> heard<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:52.550> like<00:00:52.730> computers<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:53.329> I

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
like hey I heard you like computers so I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.630 
like hey I heard you like computers so I
got<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.809> computer<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:55.070> connect<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.520> your

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
got you a computer to connect to your

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.080 
got you a computer to connect to your
computer<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:58.250> processor<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.940> in

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
computer but but the the processor is in

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.549 
computer but but the the processor is in
there<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.480> couple<00:00:59.570> reasons<00:00:59.840> one<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.320> that

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
there for a couple reasons one is that

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.920 
there for a couple reasons one is that
it<00:01:00.980> controls<00:01:01.370> LEDs<00:01:01.879> lighting<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.420> keys<00:01:02.629> so

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
it controls LEDs lighting the keys so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.419 
it controls LEDs lighting the keys so
you<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.140> get<00:01:03.260> various<00:01:03.559> effects<00:01:03.950> which<00:01:04.280> I'll

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:04.429 
you can get various effects which I'll

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:06.309 
you can get various effects which I'll
show<00:01:04.639> you<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> moment<00:01:04.999> also<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.139> keyboard

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:06.319 
show you in a moment also the keyboard

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.910 
show you in a moment also the keyboard
is<00:01:06.560> programmable<00:01:07.219> in<00:01:07.429> in<00:01:07.880> several<00:01:08.209> ways<00:01:08.420> too

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
is programmable in in several ways too

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.639 
is programmable in in several ways too
as<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.100> can<00:01:10.249> see<00:01:10.399> this<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.729> 10<00:01:11.060> keyless

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
as you can see this is a 10 keyless

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.899 
as you can see this is a 10 keyless
format<00:01:12.649> keyboard<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.459> doesn't<00:01:13.729> have<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
format keyboard so it doesn't have the

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.599 
format keyboard so it doesn't have the
numpad<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.020> extra<00:01:15.740> width<00:01:15.950> there<00:01:16.219> which<00:01:16.459> is

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
numpad and extra width there which is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.190 
numpad and extra width there which is
kind<00:01:16.789> of<00:01:16.819> nice<00:01:16.999> for<00:01:17.240> gaming<00:01:17.569> because<00:01:17.959> your

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
kind of nice for gaming because your

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.289 
kind of nice for gaming because your
mouse<00:01:18.350> will<00:01:18.619> fit<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:18.889> little<00:01:19.100> bit<00:01:19.279> more<00:01:19.880> closely

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
mouse will fit a little bit more closely

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.169 
mouse will fit a little bit more closely
in<00:01:21.009> next<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.340> your<00:01:22.579> hands<00:01:22.789> I'll<00:01:22.939> have<00:01:23.060> to

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
in next to you your hands I'll have to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.169 
in next to you your hands I'll have to
stretch<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:23.840> far<00:01:24.109> has<00:01:24.889> a<00:01:24.950> detachable<00:01:25.429> USB

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
stretch out so far has a detachable USB

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.830 
stretch out so far has a detachable USB
cable<00:01:26.569> on<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.810> back<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:28.599> make<00:01:29.599> it's

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840

blue version coming later and it will
have<00:02:04.399> blue<00:02:04.609> LEDs<00:02:05.149> there's<00:02:06.049> an<00:02:06.139> MX<00:02:06.409> red<00:02:06.679> version

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
have blue LEDs there's an MX red version

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.969 
have blue LEDs there's an MX red version
coming<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:07.909> will<00:02:07.969> have<00:02:08.119> red<00:02:08.330> LEDs<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.080> then

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
coming that will have red LEDs and then

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.910 
coming that will have red LEDs and then
possibly<00:02:10.580> an<00:02:10.910> MX<00:02:11.660> green

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
possibly an MX green

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280 
possibly an MX green
limited-edition<00:02:13.520> with<00:02:14.030> green<00:02:14.330> LEDs<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> MX

limited-edition with green LEDs and MX

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.980 
limited-edition with green LEDs and MX
greens<00:02:15.650> are<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.040> highest<00:02:17.000> actuation<00:02:17.660> force

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
greens are the highest actuation force

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.720 
greens are the highest actuation force
keys<00:02:18.320> they're<00:02:18.620> kind<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.830> rare<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.580> my

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
keys they're kind of rare it's my

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.670 
keys they're kind of rare it's my
favorite<00:02:20.180> switch<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.840> hope<00:02:21.020> they<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.560> of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
favorite switch so I hope they do one of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.540 
favorite switch so I hope they do one of
those<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.210> MX<00:02:23.450> brown<00:02:23.720> version<00:02:24.230> has<00:02:24.550> these

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
those the the MX brown version has these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.610 
those the the MX brown version has these
white<00:02:25.850> LEDs<00:02:26.390> as<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.960> see<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:27.380> they

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
white LEDs as you can see and so they

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620 
white LEDs as you can see and so they
kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> dodged<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.370> bullet<00:02:28.520> there

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
kind of dodged a bullet there

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.960 
kind of dodged a bullet there
I<00:02:29.660> don't<00:02:30.230> think<00:02:30.260> Brown<00:02:30.590> will<00:02:30.740> look<00:02:30.890> good<00:02:31.070> but

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
I don't think Brown will look good but

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.520 
I don't think Brown will look good but
let<00:02:32.510> me<00:02:32.600> walk<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.810> through<00:02:33.140> some<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
let me walk you through some of the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.620 
let me walk you through some of the
features<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.190> thing<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.300> see<00:02:35.480> it's

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
features of this thing you can see it's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.170 
features of this thing you can see it's
backlit<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.560> there's<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.610> function<00:02:38.030> key

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
backlit here and there's a function key

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.540 
backlit here and there's a function key
that<00:02:38.330> controls<00:02:38.720> most<00:02:38.990> of<00:02:39.200> its<00:02:39.380> features<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
that controls most of its features and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.540 
that controls most of its features and
what<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.790> can<00:02:40.940> do<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.450> first<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.380> all<00:02:42.500> turn<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
what you can do is first of all turn the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.670 
what you can do is first of all turn the
backlight<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.450> down<00:02:44.630> there's<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.650> guess

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
backlight up and down there's I guess

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.370 
backlight up and down there's I guess
five<00:02:46.100> levels<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.760> brightness<00:02:46.880> there<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
five levels of brightness there so it is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.770 
five levels of brightness there so it is
kind<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.770> adjustable<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.550> way<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.060> then

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
kind of adjustable in that way and then

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.150 
kind of adjustable in that way and then
it<00:02:50.870> has<00:02:50.959> several<00:02:51.170> different<00:02:51.530> modes<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:52.100> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
it has several different modes that you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.610 
it has several different modes that you
can<00:02:52.280> switch<00:02:52.670> into<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.870> called<00:02:54.140> breathing

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
can switch into this is called breathing

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.820 
can switch into this is called breathing
mode<00:02:54.830> here<00:02:55.480> where<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.900> gets<00:02:57.200> brighter<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
mode here where it gets brighter and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.680 
mode here where it gets brighter and
darker<00:02:58.220> very<00:02:58.790> slowly<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.320> can<00:03:00.500> see<00:03:01.690> kind

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
darker very slowly as you can see kind

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.420 
darker very slowly as you can see kind
of<00:03:02.900> nifty<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.739> got<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> couple<00:03:07.190> of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
of nifty and then it's got a couple of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.090 
of nifty and then it's got a couple of
other<00:03:08.000> modes<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.930> are<00:03:09.050> interesting<00:03:09.590> this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
other modes that are interesting this

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.840 
other modes that are interesting this
one<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:11.110> one<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.290> basically<00:03:12.830> on<00:03:13.190> actuation

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
one is a one that basically on actuation

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.350 
one is a one that basically on actuation
the<00:03:13.940> key<00:03:14.120> lights<00:03:14.330> up<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:14.600> check<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.140> out<00:03:19.360> so

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the key lights up so check it out so

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.449 
the key lights up so check it out so
that's<00:03:20.480> nice<00:03:21.110> but<00:03:21.560> it's<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.769> little<00:03:21.799> bit<00:03:22.100> subtle

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that's nice but it's a little bit subtle

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.430 
that's nice but it's a little bit subtle
and<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.660> here's<00:03:23.870> my<00:03:23.930> favorite

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
and so here's my favorite

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.680 
and so here's my favorite
you<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.100> switch<00:03:25.340> into<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.000> next<00:03:26.269> mode<00:03:26.450> which

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
you can switch into the next mode which

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.860 
you can switch into the next mode which
is<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:28.190> lights<00:03:28.489> up<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.850> actuation<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.780> then

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
is it lights up on actuation and then

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.240 
is it lights up on actuation and then
there's<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.110> decay<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.670> key<00:03:31.880> key<00:03:32.840> doesn't

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
there's a decay so the key key doesn't

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.759 
there's a decay so the key key doesn't
immediately<00:03:34.269> go<00:03:35.269> down<00:03:35.450> dark<00:03:35.750> again<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.530> check

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
immediately go down dark again so check

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:45.400 
immediately go down dark again so check
this<00:03:36.920> out<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:44.510> friends<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.049> what<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.350> is

very cool effect personally I think it's
great<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:49.910> saw<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.239> sources<00:03:50.720> yes<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.470> was

otherwise but this little that little
thing<00:03:57.769> is<00:03:57.890> kind<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.310> icing<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:58.880> top<00:03:59.120> that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
thing is kind of that icing on top that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.930 
thing is kind of that icing on top that
makes<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.930> really<00:04:00.140> interesting<00:04:00.950> for<00:04:01.640> more

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
makes it really interesting for more

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.509 
makes it really interesting for more
practical<00:04:02.540> less<00:04:02.959> sort<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.799> showy<00:04:04.100> things
