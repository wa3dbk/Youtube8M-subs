00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.650
 for this project we are going to need a 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.720
 white sheet colored sheets and little things 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.960
 to decorate in addition to glue and a 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.960
 toothpick 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.060
 first let's take one of the strips 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.860
 of paper we fold it in half together 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.340
 the points 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.260
 and we mark this double well 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.940
 Now let's stop and we will use 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.940
 the tips towards the other 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.120
 let's roll up carefully to go 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 giving shapes 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.220
 now let's support the corners well 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.540
 and we are going to shape the part of 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 down the wing of the butterfly 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.539
 let's put together let's paste and what 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.010
 We paste on the paper already in the place where 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.010
 we want and with whatever form 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.100
 let's do the same with another strip more 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.200
 we're just going to make sure this one stays 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 a little bigger and where there is a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.370
 bit different but the thesis in that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 is going to be the mind rolling the dots 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.990
 inwards and then we paste similar 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.990
 how we did it to make a heart 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.780
 since we have the ways like 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.240
 we want let's play carefully in the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.000
 sheet 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.220
 what follows is to make the antennas for 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560
 this is going to need another strip which 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 let's fold in half 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 and we will go over the routes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.150
 but now let's roll up the tips 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.150
 towards the same side 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 we arrived and we have the antennas of the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.939
 handle 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.189
 now with the rest of the sheets we are going to 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.319
 Give shape to what is left between two or 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.840
 Three colors with light pink rose 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.700
 and together you can combine the colors 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 that you want or make it the same color 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.939
 I will repeat the same process that we have 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.189
 done previously to do this from 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.990
 screw in and paste to 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.210
 shape it 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.210
 to the butterflies 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.120
 let's repeat this both above and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.890
 down on the two wool parts here you 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.370
 You can let your imagination fly and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 fill it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.670
 but when giving him the shares ideas 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.890
 little by little we will fill the wool in the 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.050
 butterfly know we can take 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.590
 drops of water to improve the little circle 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.660
 iron 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.660
 we can give you what you have 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.290
 little by little barcelona so that they are going to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.110
 be the games 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.110
 to a paper 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.730
 finished the butterfly works for the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.730
 background of the portal butterflies
