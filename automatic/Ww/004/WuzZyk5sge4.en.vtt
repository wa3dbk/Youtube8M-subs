too<00:01:32.530> complicated<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:33.130> build<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.460> reckon<00:01:33.729> if

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
too complicated to build so I reckon if

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.309 
too complicated to build so I reckon if
you<00:01:33.939> guys<00:01:34.060> wanted<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.450> you'd<00:01:34.959> probably<00:01:35.110> get

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
you guys wanted to you'd probably get

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.690 
you guys wanted to you'd probably get
air<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.590> your<00:01:35.649> eye<00:01:35.709> like<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.069> did<00:01:36.219> but<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.640> you

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
air in your eye like I did but I you

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.949 
air in your eye like I did but I you
could<00:01:36.909> probably<00:01:37.119> build<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.450> Christmas<00:01:37.780> tree

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
could probably build the Christmas tree

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.389 
could probably build the Christmas tree
as<00:01:38.049> well<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.439> thought<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.740> explained<00:01:39.130> how

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
as well so I thought it explained how

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.490 
as well so I thought it explained how
look<00:01:39.640> like<00:01:39.819> what<00:01:40.030> sort<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.359> went<00:01:40.479> into<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.719> how

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
look like what sort of went into it how

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.499 
look like what sort of went into it how
exactly<00:01:41.649> maybe<00:01:42.219> you<00:01:42.429> probably<00:01:42.789> need<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.149> lot<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
exactly maybe you probably need a lot of

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.480 
exactly maybe you probably need a lot of
loose<00:01:43.689> facts<00:01:43.990> like<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.289> tool<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.829> have<00:01:45.159> no

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
loose facts like this tool I have no

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.449 
loose facts like this tool I have no
idea<00:01:45.759> how<00:01:45.939> many<00:01:46.000> boots<00:01:46.270> back<00:01:46.450> there<00:01:46.810> took<00:01:50.459> all

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
idea how many boots back there took all

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.069 
idea how many boots back there took all
righty<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:51.970> future<00:01:52.299> Enders<00:01:52.569> gonna<00:01:52.750> jump<00:01:52.989> in

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
righty so future Enders gonna jump in

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.240 
righty so future Enders gonna jump in
here<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.259> actually<00:01:53.470> try<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.799> teach<00:01:54.039> you<00:01:54.159> guys

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
here and actually try to teach you guys

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.160 
here and actually try to teach you guys
how<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.520> build<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.939> trunk<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.630> branches<00:01:55.750> and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
how to build the trunk the branches and

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.050 
how to build the trunk the branches and
leaves<00:01:56.229> or<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:56.799> so<00:01:57.159> step<00:01:57.459> number<00:01:57.489> one<00:01:57.729> you're

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
leaves or it so step number one you're

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.580 
leaves or it so step number one you're
gonna<00:01:58.239> need<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.569> lot<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:59.200> booze<00:01:59.349> bags

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
gonna need a lot of booze bags

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.870 
gonna need a lot of booze bags
I'm<00:01:59.770> not<00:01:59.979> sure<00:02:00.130> if<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.369> guys<00:02:00.489> want<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.759> make<00:02:00.849> a

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
I'm not sure if you guys want to make a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.339 
I'm not sure if you guys want to make a
small<00:02:01.179> one<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.420> definitely<00:02:01.899> can't<00:02:02.079> with<00:02:02.200> not

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
small one you definitely can't with not

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.109 
small one you definitely can't with not
as<00:02:02.469> many<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:02.829> I've<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.489> what<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.610> used<00:02:03.939> it

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
as many but I've this is what I used it

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.520 
as many but I've this is what I used it
was<00:02:04.239> three-quarters<00:02:05.079> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.289> year<00:02:05.439> I'm

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
was three-quarters of the year I'm

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.869 
was three-quarters of the year I'm
pretty<00:02:05.739> sure<00:02:05.890> which<00:02:06.099> is<00:02:06.250> actually<00:02:06.579> quite<00:02:06.849> a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:06.879 
pretty sure which is actually quite a

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.550 
pretty sure which is actually quite a
few<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:07.479> anyway<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.110> trunk<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.530> tree

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
few but anyway so the trunk of the tree

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
few but anyway so the trunk of the tree
you<00:02:08.829> can<00:02:08.979> need<00:02:09.129> some<00:02:09.340> newspaper<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.000> what

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
you can need some newspaper and what

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.520 
you can need some newspaper and what
you're<00:02:10.239> gonna<00:02:10.329> do<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.569> newspaper<00:02:11.019> I'll

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you're gonna do with that newspaper I'll

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.289 
you're gonna do with that newspaper I'll
get<00:02:11.769> two<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.099> three<00:02:12.129> sheets<00:02:12.579> roll<00:02:12.879> it<00:02:13.000> up<00:02:13.120> into

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
get two or three sheets roll it up into

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.000 
get two or three sheets roll it up into
a<00:02:13.390> cylinder<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.959> do<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.260> multiple<00:02:14.620> times<00:02:14.680> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
a cylinder and do that multiple times I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.500 
a cylinder and do that multiple times I
think<00:02:15.129> about<00:02:15.310> three<00:02:15.579> times<00:02:15.760> stick<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
think about three times stick it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.890 
think about three times stick it
together

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
together

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.300 
together
and<00:02:17.019> that's<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.379> trunk<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.040> make<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and that's the trunk to make the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.710 
and that's the trunk to make the
branches<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.090> gonna<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.329> the<00:02:19.450> exact

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
branches that this is gonna do the exact

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.970 
branches that this is gonna do the exact
same<00:02:19.750> method<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.260> you're<00:02:20.530> gonna<00:02:20.620> put<00:02:20.829> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
same method but you're gonna put the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.009 
same method but you're gonna put the
slight<00:02:21.220> little<00:02:21.400> bendy<00:02:21.850> bit<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.239> top<00:02:22.450> oh<00:02:22.630> my

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
slight little bendy bit at the top oh my

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.690 
slight little bendy bit at the top oh my
gosh<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.470> looks<00:02:23.650> pretty<00:02:23.859> hashtag<00:02:24.190> cray<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.639> know

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
gosh it looks pretty hashtag cray I know

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.280 
gosh it looks pretty hashtag cray I know
and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.480> for<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.720> leaves<00:02:25.930> you're<00:02:26.109> just

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and then for the leaves you're just

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.840 
and then for the leaves you're just
gonna<00:02:26.410> staple<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.889> bunch<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.220> blue<00:02:27.340> specks<00:02:27.609> on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
gonna staple a bunch of blue specks on

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.309 
gonna staple a bunch of blue specks on
the<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.359> spread<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.079> that's

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
the are like spread out like that that's

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.000 
the are like spread out like that that's
a<00:02:29.410> good<00:02:29.500> example

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
a good example

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
ah that's more of a color palette or

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.520 
ah that's more of a color palette or
what<00:02:31.660> are<00:02:31.750> used<00:02:31.930> I'll<00:02:32.170> actually<00:02:32.380> use

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
what are used I'll actually use

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.080 
what are used I'll actually use
different<00:02:32.889> colored<00:02:33.190> blue<00:02:33.340> specks<00:02:33.639> but<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
different colored blue specks but you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.460 
different colored blue specks but you
know<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:34.329> your<00:02:34.480> tree<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.930> anything<00:02:35.260> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
know what your tree can be anything you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.960 
know what your tree can be anything you
want<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:35.889> anyway<00:02:36.160> I'll<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:36.489> back<00:02:36.639> to<00:02:36.790> pass

base what I've done I've got an

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.339 
base what I've done I've got an
old-school<00:02:40.209> like<00:02:40.480> rubbish<00:02:40.840> bin<00:02:41.019> it's<00:02:41.170> sort<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
old-school like rubbish bin it's sort of

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.900 
old-school like rubbish bin it's sort of
taped<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.739> around<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.130> glorious<00:02:42.609> I<00:02:42.730> don't

I'll put some more booze backs around

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.460 
I'll put some more booze backs around
the<00:02:46.090> base<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.660> I've<00:02:46.750> got<00:02:46.900> some<00:02:46.930> Poland

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the base but then I've got some Poland

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.129 
I don't really ever read them myself
just<00:02:52.060> collected<00:02:52.419> them<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> thought<00:02:53.049> I'd

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
just collected them so I thought I'd

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.569 
just collected them so I thought I'd
just<00:02:53.260> put<00:02:53.440> them<00:02:53.590> at<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.739> base<00:02:53.859> into<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> bin

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
just put them at the base into the bin

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.309 
just put them at the base into the bin
which<00:02:55.120> sounds<00:02:55.419> terrible<00:02:55.750> when<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.019> not<00:02:56.169> like

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
which sounds terrible when it's not like

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.599 
which sounds terrible when it's not like
it's<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.859> bin<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.160> base<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
it's just in the bin of the base of the

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.949 
it's just in the bin of the base of the
Christmas<00:02:57.970> tree<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.450> make<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.720> even<00:02:58.930> more

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959

so what the top we've got like a massive
star<00:03:12.669> thing<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.329> simply<00:03:13.690> made<00:03:13.840> out<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.109> boost

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
star thing it's simply made out of boost

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.870 
star thing it's simply made out of boost
boxes<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.069> I've<00:03:15.160> done<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.489> pruned<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
boxes and what I've done I pruned the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.089 
boxes and what I've done I pruned the
first<00:03:16.090> box<00:03:16.329> down<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.780> star<00:03:17.049> then<00:03:17.500> glued<00:03:17.829> on

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
first box down to a star then glued on

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.650 
first box down to a star then glued on
the<00:03:18.220> boost<00:03:18.430> backs<00:03:18.669> and<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.940> phantom<00:03:19.299> forces

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the boost backs and the phantom forces

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.870 
the boost backs and the phantom forces
are<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.260> those<00:03:20.470> backs

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
are here those backs

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.580 
are here those backs
then<00:03:21.030> turns<00:03:21.300> into<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.540> star<00:03:22.140> he<00:03:22.260> took<00:03:22.440> around

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
then turns into a star he took around

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.260 
then turns into a star he took around
three<00:03:23.040> months<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> build<00:03:23.520> which<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> quite<00:03:24.240> a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270
