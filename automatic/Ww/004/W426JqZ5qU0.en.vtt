00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 so hey people gets to a new one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.260
 Video Thanks for switching today as you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 Of course, you 'll see how much battle 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.230
 Gameplay show this is in the background 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.300
 from the xbox one livestream or from the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.240
 Press conference the gameplay view 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.460
 shows here the battlefield 4 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 singleplayer mode in the whole game are 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 Of course we tend to get up a bit 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.619
 stretched the multiplayer mode 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 Nonetheless, I would like that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 Just show what you are doing here 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 to see is quite interesting 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 and really entertaining 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 The mission we see here calls 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.790
 be angry cie 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 you see a few approaches from 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.440
 revolution 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 it's probably just that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.510
 another name for destruction 3.0 for 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 example, there is under a jet 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 which you can shoot down that is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 You can see some right on the edge 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 packed that is a weird and there 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 you can then turn the brake 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.410
 so to speak solve this block the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 before it is and thus becomes this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.330
 jet down cut and all 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 Opponents in the way are all from the ship 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 hagen the whole is pretty cool 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.439
 Gameplay element and I was quite 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.869
 impressed as I in the livestream 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.670
 personally, the weapons have the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 By the way, we have to see here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 including the u100 one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.250
 supposedly sg 552 turns out to be ak 5 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 turns out that ak 5 is one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.420
 Swedish weapon and I think so 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.909
 personally really cool times 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.710
 to see something Swedish means well 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.720
 good, there are very nice 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 weapons are not necessarily Swedish but 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.689
 that's the swedish game 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 developer of dice so now times 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.409
 Battlefield finally does it now 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 I think that brings in Swedish weapons 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.200
 really good 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.290
 another weapon we saw 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.180
 is designer and does not leave now 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 so special if you're wondering 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 on which platform this was played 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.710
 this one was probably going to be 90 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.079
 percent if I'm sure on pcs 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.180
 plays because you see, for example, partially above 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.850
 right a shift button and the gives 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.259
 it does not work on the xbox 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.660
 understandably, that too became 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.380
 not with keyboard and mouse play too 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.570
 if it should be synonymous pc 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.980
 It just does not feel so good 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.600
 desk on top of the stage 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090
 that's why it's pretty 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.550
 easy to understand that this is synonymous with 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 an xbox controller was earned 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.660
 towards the end of the video you can see 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.090
 how nice the water is that 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.790
 a significant upgrade from 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.370
 to see battlefield 3 it looks 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.780
 already really more dynamic is natural 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 this again only the singleplayer that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.400
 you really have to pay attention, but still 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.910
 Also the single player graphic has changed 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.980
 as expected, significantly improved 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.380
 So you play in one here 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.050
 patrol boat you have like hickel 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.540
 So vehicle life generation also in the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.250
 Vehicle that means you will usually 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.660
 do not die unless you play 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 probably on hardcore or something then 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.070
 this will be turned off accordingly 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.740
 you probably already have it here 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.150
 unlimited ammunition that means you can do so 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.090
 Shoot as much as you want, of course 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.030
 But you still have to load if 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.070
 the magazine or something similar empty 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.300
 shot 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.640
 I can not wait to see you 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.170
 what the multiplayer show tonight 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 I'll just take it to the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.790
 see the video before 22 clock that looks 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.190
 If you look at it after 22 o'clock 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.750
 then the multiplayer may be 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.030
 already shown and I will 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.800
 present yourself as soon as possible 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.830
 because I know what you mean by that 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.390
 if it's the mission 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.490
 they are angry here in the background 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.380
 lasts throughout 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.300
 five and a half minutes that is who 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.250
 Battlefield 3 has played remembers 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.020
 probably there were already some 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 longer mission but also shorter 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.870
 that means that is probably here 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.120
 one of the shorter missions 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.620
 as well it was just somehow a 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 showcase thing and tonight he will 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.670
 as I said a lot more of the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.250
 multiplayer and that's something for me 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.040
 personally a corner counts more than 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.270
 this single player gameplay so that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.160
 It was already synonymous to this video 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.830
 I hope you like that 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.600
 My question I leave out this time 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.950
 because that was so spontaneous now 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.320
 video and I prefer to build in one 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.810
 video that is regularly posted and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.650
 where I have a little more time, nothing 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.419
 In spite of that I would change a lot 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.769
 a thumb should look upwards 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.209
 you that we liked the height 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.310
 and if it had not already done so 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.530
 I am also very happy about an abo 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.690
 because you are guaranteed to miss nothing 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.039
 more about battlefield 4 or rather 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.630
 about battlefield 4 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.470
 then there is to see and hopefully 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.470
 Until next time
