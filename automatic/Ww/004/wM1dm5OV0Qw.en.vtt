00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 we have a problem there that month 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.400
 January because rain is missing 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 especially in the southeast region 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 we had until the rains enough 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.720
 in the north center of mines 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.520
 in the holy spirit and also in the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 rio de janeiro during the month of december 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 but there was a lot of rain in São Paulo and the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 the first half of January was marked 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.939
 then dry weather at 1 with little rain 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 really in most areas of the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.450
 southeast 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 some more temporal storms fell in a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 day in place 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.420
 another day in the other and temporal is not this 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 dam how will you get there the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 rainfall conditions with the estimated 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 for this second fortnight of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 January we'll see how it goes 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 so the wet conditions are better 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.039
 here looks at a majority of the southeast 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.530
 also from the center of west of Brazil to the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930
 on the 22nd we will have more 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 rainfall instability more 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 frequent that can be several strong 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 Areas of Mato Grosso 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 federal mines and even the area 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.020
 leaving the river and the Holy Spirit can 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.689
 accumulate up to more than 100 millimeters 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.080
 in the next five days to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.979
 very little rainfall to the south of the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.409
 Brazil, right? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 the air is very dry in the south and most 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 Northeastern areas will also have few 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 the rainy season until January 22 in the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 from 23 to 27 January the conditions for 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 rain starts to decline again over the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 southeast region of the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 Brazil 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 we're going to have a dry air mass 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 gaining strength again and then his back 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.399
 to reduce but see only one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.880
 concentration of rainfall between the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.009
 amazon né the mato grosso mato region 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.630
 southern and also the region 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.130
 important here of the mining triangle 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.380
 south-central goiás 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.799
 these areas should still be their 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.100
 bulky, and there may be 150 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.930
 millimeters in the accumulated period 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.909
 also interesting to note that back 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.209
 tense to rain showers more frequent 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.340
 also about the south region of brazil 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.810
 however it is very worrying that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 trend towards the end 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.450
 January and the very beginning of February to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.780
 expectation that a large system of 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.390
 high pressure to reinforce again on 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.580
 southeast and center-west of the country and 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.330
 the rain reduction then we should 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.239
 start the month of February again 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.760
 in a very hot situation and few 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.650
 rainfall in most of the southeast as well 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.650
 part of the west central part of the country
