00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.540
 one of the highlights of a trash is 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.990
 in fact the awareness of one's own 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.360
 limits never exceed those who get hurt 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.510
 for unconsciousness and exhibitionism yes 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.750
 away from the spirit of parkour if 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.010
 followed as a discipline instead 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.380
 will help reach maturity e 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.510
 self-confidence 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 this because it is parallel to the body 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.399
 the mind also trains constantly 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.589
 subjected to stress is forced to 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.390
 to face the fear of being the object of 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.530
 a fair a famous such show 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.899
 disconnection if things are known for Susa 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.999
 the pris 2 chianese are the expression yes 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 can already boast need to write then 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:59.050
 left because the call we were 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.229
 secure watson physicality and steed on pack 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.629
 if the large eyewear package 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.580
 old confederation susca the yellow 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.990
 from the Pope with 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.990
 Yes No 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.530
 you should leave for a while you are 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.530
 seen 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:37.729
 and who if Russia had ended more 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:42.370
 sure you can do what you do 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.370
 laws 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.350
 a natural impulse that all trash 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.479
 try during practice is fear 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.090
 this instinct on one side and beneficial 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.030
 because it protects us from challenges we believe 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.470
 above our reach 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.110
 thus preventing us from facing them e 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.960
 wrong on the other is unfavorable 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.200
 because it is not always justified and is a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.630
 notable mental brakes are those who train 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.209
 constantly manages to outline a 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.010
 personal framework of the limits and will be 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.900
 able to moderate during 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.269
 training 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.530
 thanks to this the trash does not 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.080
 will exceed the threshold of its own 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.820
 ability will understand itself 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.400
 it will become more secure than its own 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.680
 movements and then face the other 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.350
 face the fear by overcoming it 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 progressively through a perfect one 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:46.660
 symbiosis between body and mind the things that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:50.120
 there were those who touched part of the stream that paid 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.580
 and cotton segis home there is guilty there 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.600
 let the package separate the sites from jennifer 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.769
 there cannot be anyone who goes to whom 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.760
 there was the top ten giulio to open it ee 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.670
 there was more 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.379
 therefore constant and gradual training 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.150
 will allow you to study and deal with 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.400
 own fears 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 the improvement of one's body and the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.690
 overcoming mental barriers 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.360
 will lead to security over time 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.989
 always greater even if apprehension 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.890
 it will never completely vanish when the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.519
 fear blocks the mind you are not ready so 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.280
 that the defense of the goiters that will close 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.590
 lighting with sides and rejection a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.519
 chips or kingi hackers like ciccone 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 the 6c technicians being able to try jumps is not 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.769
 parcours in the parkour does not try e 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.140
 during training that you put on 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.109
 to the test with themselves they repeat themselves 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.000
 continually the same jumps studying 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.940
 and observing the obstacle from various 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.190
 angulations the fear faced 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.129
 through persistent training 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.079
 gradually fades away because one is capable 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.560
 to perform actions almost like 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.780
 automatisms will come back anyway 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.519
 in front of every new obstacle but with the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.200
 name of prudence 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.910
 one of the fundamental rules of the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.910
 after all, parkour is safety 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.950
 any sor 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.680
 after successfully completing i 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.600
 movements will feel satisfied with the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.940
 own work but payment 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.920
 momentary will not prevent him from searching 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.260
 to progress every day 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.630
 thus approaching the true meaning 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.780
 of parkour to persevere for 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.660
 improve and improve

 A woodwind is one of the poles and passes

 putting himself munch saint denis in the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.480
 fiction 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.230
 of parkour is important to grasp 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.730
 the utility factor sometimes underestimated 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.860
 also by professionals 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.170
 despite being tied to freedom 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.480
 because the latter derives from the 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.980
 disappearance of material limits and there 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.520
 allows to trace a path 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.890
 smooth and fluid then move into 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.540
 quickly and effectively parkour e 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.420
 let's not forget that the utilitarian comes from 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.550
 from techniques used to save lives 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.860
 so the trash now has the capacity and the 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.560
 possibility to devise routes 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.110
 alternative and more efficient for 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.390
 move from one point to another respect 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.680
 to any obstacle that the road 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.380
 can offer 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:41.540
 and the attack they call jan pregis beige 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.640
 make up a practical that always thanks 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.020
 to the physical condition it makes us passive 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:54.150
 gray sticker 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:07:00.360

 quote to rinse the trash or should 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.639
 have the ability to observe 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.979
 carefully what surrounds it e 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.470
 devise an appropriate path to their own 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.360
 ability the utility can be 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.669
 considered the medium that leads to 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.530
 feeling of freedom 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:33.380
 the acquisition of technical movements that 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.060
 can help us move 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.430
 will enable us to exploit what is there 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.590
 surrounds and to trace a path into 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.690
 total freedom 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:45.240
 each will translate its own style a way 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:48.719
 different to study things to discover 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.060
 to understand to perceive but the sense of 

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:52.860
 freedom and shared by the trans when 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.860
 they trace a path overcoming the 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.960
 obstacles with ease therefore having one 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.380
 great mastery of the body and the 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.229
 mind 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.529
 and perhaps this is what there is of 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:06.300
 more emotionally profound in parkour 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:08.819
 an art in which the possibility transposes 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.430
 to express oneself is a discipline in which 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:15.020
 he can confront himself with others with himself 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.020
 itself and with the surrounding world
