00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.179

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 So not so great I know there was still there 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.940
 there is still a job in the old town so 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.859
 a small nightclub what I saw was 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'm up to four, I know what I mean 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.789
 on the microphone that one has me then synonymous 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.619
 we have already celebrated great 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.619
 the whole old town was in 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 state of emergency 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.379
 then fc was yes at the time he has 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.750
 then still as the whole 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 Great club seen and how long the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.129
 halftime break back against the cologne 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.379
 expected 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.350
 tactical approach of the trainer otto 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.750
 Rehhagel at the time that came 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.540
 but not Otto Rehhagel 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.570
 then asked every player how they want 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.399
 her breakfast table tomorrow morning 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.869
 children explain when asked 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.970
 Dad has to be the cup 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.679
 she wanted to explain to her children that 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.289
 maybe the cup here today 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.220
 do not win and that's why 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.300
 maybe it was impressive for me 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.380
 some players wear a bit like that 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.659
 Disappointed on the treatment couch 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.220
 long back and suddenly says clack 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.840
 clack clack all the stones on the clack 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.800
 Troupe suddenly became uneasily alive 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.659
 how wild drives how to hold on 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.789
 had to be practical and then sings before 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.220
 the kick-off of the referee 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.100
 my predator already out in the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.030
 cell and scope out and within 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.860
 ten minutes 52 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 the beautiful thing was that my brother was the gate 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.500
 shot but one the most important 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.590
 even if we as a team thinks happy 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 of course you are doing very well 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 a classic attack with rudi bommer 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 on the right side of the then also very 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.020
 was strong on the outside 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.300
 through to the right and gimmicks too 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.440
 somehow turn it on with the toe 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 got over the line 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.130
 every year to be allowed to experience german 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.660
 to become a cup winner 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.530
 gelsenkirchen special quality straight 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.709
 against the cologne 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.060
 It goes on and on, of course 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.230
 to think how they feel 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 can represent vice versa
