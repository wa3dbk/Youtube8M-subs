00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
raised the engine motor mount up to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.929 
raised the engine motor mount up to
inches<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.130> I've<00:00:20.249> got<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.519> set<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.759> right

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
inches the way I've got it set up right

now I should be able when I measured it

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.640 
now I should be able when I measured it
when<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.659> floor<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.140> could<00:00:25.499> drop

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
when it was on the floor I could drop

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.439 
when it was on the floor I could drop
that<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.400> inch<00:00:26.609> above<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.999> water<00:00:27.239> level

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
that in one inch above the water level
and<00:00:27.779> raise<00:00:28.679> up<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> end<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> where<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.730> got

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and raise up this end to where I've got

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
and raise up this end to where I've got
a<00:00:29.970> two-to-one<00:00:30.689> pitch<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.380> overall<00:00:31.679> length

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
a two-to-one pitch for overall length

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.710 
a two-to-one pitch for overall length
which<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> seven<00:00:32.700> foot<00:00:32.880> four<00:00:33.210> inches<00:00:33.510> right

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
kind of stuff I took the other pipe
house<00:01:01.190> now<00:01:02.190> another<00:01:02.460> thing<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:03.589> make<00:01:04.589> your

changes<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> took<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> Grizzly<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.870> I<00:01:06.960> put<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
changes I took the Grizzly and I put it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
changes I took the Grizzly and I put it
on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.440> springs<00:01:08.000> say<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.210> spring-loaded

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
on the springs say it's spring-loaded

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.649 
on the springs say it's spring-loaded
now<00:01:10.400> I'm<00:01:11.400> thinking<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> rocks<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
now I'm thinking that when the rocks the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.250 
now I'm thinking that when the rocks the
big<00:01:12.810> rock

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
big rock

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
big rock
did<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.620> bounce<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> may<00:01:14.340> help<00:01:14.490> bounce

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
did it bounce that it may help bounce

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.969 
did it bounce that it may help bounce
some<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.180> material<00:01:15.659> off<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.650> think

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
some of the material off and I do think

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.730 
some of the material off and I do think
I'm<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.190> go<00:01:17.310> ahead<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.180> little

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
I'm gonna go ahead and take these little

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.960 
I'm gonna go ahead and take these little
ones<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.159> told<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.550> leave<00:01:20.700> loose

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
ones that I was told to leave loose

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.710 
ones that I was told to leave loose
there

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
there

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.360 
there
I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:22.380> i'ma<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.560> ahead<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.920> weld<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
I think i'ma go ahead and weld in

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.770 
I think i'ma go ahead and weld in
together<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:23.940> was<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.660> my

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
together but that was just for my

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
together but that was just for my
biggest<00:01:24.990> problem<00:01:25.440> is<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.190> rocks<00:01:26.430> are

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
biggest problem is they the rocks are

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.220 
biggest problem is they the rocks are
stick<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.660> big<00:01:27.810> want<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> come<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
stick there and a big want to come in

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.780 
stick there and a big want to come in
and<00:01:28.350> hit<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:28.680> it'll<00:01:28.800> get<00:01:28.950> wedged<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.580> there

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and hit it and it'll get wedged in there

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:42.160 
and hit it and it'll get wedged in there
and<00:01:29.940> then<00:01:30.030> come<00:01:30.450> out

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.350 

noise<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.340> was<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.580> loose<00:01:43.760> pieces<00:01:44.060> though

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
noise it was just loose pieces though

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.250 
noise it was just loose pieces though
but<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:47.210> other<00:01:47.330> change<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:47.840> made<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
but the other change I made to the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.890 
but the other change I made to the
header<00:01:48.409> box<00:01:48.650> is<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.670> made<00:01:49.880> these<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.300> slip

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
header box is the made these little slip

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.830 
header box is the made these little slip
slip<00:01:51.380> joints<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.220> they<00:01:52.850> pivot<00:01:53.390> we've

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
slip joints right here they pivot we've

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.830 
slip joints right here they pivot we've
got<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> bolt<00:01:54.260> in<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.800> backside<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.750> when<00:01:56.750> you

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
got a bolt in the backside so when you

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.780 
got a bolt in the backside so when you
let<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.140> down<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.740> pivots<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.310> turns<00:01:58.580> out

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
let this down it pivots and turns out

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.180 
let this down it pivots and turns out
like<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.210> out<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.540> way<00:01:59.690> now<00:02:00.410> this<00:02:01.009> is

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
like that out of the way now this is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.010 
like that out of the way now this is
allowing<00:02:01.430> me<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.790> go<00:02:02.030> up<00:02:02.210> six<00:02:02.479> inches<00:02:02.750> higher

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
allowing me to go up six inches higher

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.380 
allowing me to go up six inches higher
than<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.530> originally<00:02:03.650> could<00:02:04.160> this<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.210> what<00:02:05.360> I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
than I originally could this is what I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.870 
than I originally could this is what I
made<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> first<00:02:05.990> time<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.490> had<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.759> mounted

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
made the first time and I had it mounted

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.430 
made the first time and I had it mounted
on<00:02:08.179> here<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> actually<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.110> worked<00:02:09.289> really

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
on here and it actually it worked really

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.860 
on here and it actually it worked really
good<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.070> was<00:02:10.190> limited<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.750> know

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
good but it was limited to just you know

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.840 
good but it was limited to just you know
it<00:02:12.020> wouldn't<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.220> as<00:02:13.340> high<00:02:13.520> as<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.790> can

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
it wouldn't that was as high as I can

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.449 
it wouldn't that was as high as I can
ever<00:02:14.120> make<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.440> when<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.770> put<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> sluice

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
ever make it and when you put the sluice

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.430 
ever make it and when you put the sluice
box<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:17.239> angle<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.200> gets

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
box up at an angle like this this gets

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.040 
box up at an angle like this this gets
flatter<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.209> there's<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.480> high<00:02:20.630> banker

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
flatter you know there's a high banker

in<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> bridge<00:02:21.950> they're<00:02:22.459> similar<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.090> with

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
in the bridge they're similar but with

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.759 
in the bridge they're similar but with
the<00:02:23.420> header<00:02:23.600> box<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.080> little<00:02:24.290> bit<00:02:24.410> different

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
the header box is a little bit different

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.890 
the header box is a little bit different
got<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:25.940> two<00:02:26.000> different<00:02:26.150> angles<00:02:26.420> I

got to be in two different angles I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.780 
got to be in two different angles I
won't<00:02:27.590> do<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.739> lot<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:27.950> experimenting<00:02:28.550> with<00:02:28.670> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
won't do a lot of experimenting with it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.759 
won't do a lot of experimenting with it
find<00:02:29.300> out<00:02:29.390> what's<00:02:29.630> going<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.050> optimal

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
angle to have it to make everything work

angle to have it to make everything work
good<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:36.230> thing<00:02:36.440> I'm<00:02:36.650> definitely<00:02:37.040> think

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
good now one thing I'm definitely think

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.560 
good now one thing I'm definitely think
I'm<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.489> go<00:02:37.610> ahead<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.940> change<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.420> I've

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
I'm going to go ahead and change it I've

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.229 
I'm going to go ahead and change it I've
got<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.280> ball<00:02:40.280> joint<00:02:40.550> system<00:02:41.060> right<00:02:41.180> here

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
got this ball joint system right here

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.660 
got this ball joint system right here
that<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.600> made<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.830> whenever<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.220> had<00:02:43.459> water

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
that I made to so whenever I had water

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970 
that I made to so whenever I had water
hooked<00:02:43.940> up<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.300> highbanker<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.530> know<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:45.920> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
hooked up that highbanker you know so I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.920 
hooked up that highbanker you know so I
can<00:02:46.130> control<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.790> water<00:02:47.000> pressure<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.660> know

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
can control the water pressure you know

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.020 
can control the water pressure you know
in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.890> highbanker<00:02:49.370> itself<00:02:49.670> slow<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.000> down

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
in the highbanker itself slow it down

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.830 
in the highbanker itself slow it down
speed<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.540> up

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
speed it up

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.050 
speed it up
all<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.140> have<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> do<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:52.220> speed<00:02:52.640> up<00:02:52.670> or<00:02:53.000> slow

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
all I have to do is speed up or slow

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.940 
all I have to do is speed up or slow
down<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.420> pump<00:02:53.810> motor<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.260> don't<00:02:54.440> need<00:02:54.650> this

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
down the pump motor I don't need this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.979 
down the pump motor I don't need this
and<00:02:55.370> as<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.820> can<00:02:55.910> see<00:02:56.090> from<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> cracks<00:02:56.720> in

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
and as you can see from the cracks in

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.680 
and as you can see from the cracks in
here<00:02:57.290> I'm<00:02:57.590> gonna<00:02:57.769> see<00:02:58.160> them<00:02:58.280> or<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:59.540> got

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
here I'm gonna see them or not it got

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.810 
here I'm gonna see them or not it got
frozen<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.350> broke<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.829> I'm<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.430> gonna<00:03:01.579> cut

place for the water hose right at the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.830 
place for the water hose right at the
pump<00:03:10.610> motor<00:03:10.760> where<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.090> can<00:03:11.239> switch<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.690> and

pump motor where I can switch it on and
off

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
off

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.320 
off
of<00:03:13.220> course<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.490> know<00:03:13.610> this<00:03:13.760> went<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.060> like

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
of course you know this went on like

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.570 
of course you know this went on like
this<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.050> always<00:03:15.170> make<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.740> where<00:03:15.920> you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
this and you always make it to where you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.700 
this and you always make it to where you
can<00:03:16.640> pull<00:03:16.910> these<00:03:17.120> pipes<00:03:17.420> out<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:18.470> they'll

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
can pull these pipes out because they'll

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.390 
can pull these pipes out because they'll
get<00:03:18.890> full<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.390> gravel<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.630> sand<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:22.280> have

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
get full of gravel and sand and you have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.390 
get full of gravel and sand and you have
to<00:03:22.490> pull<00:03:22.670> them<00:03:22.730> out<00:03:22.880> clean<00:03:23.180> them<00:03:23.300> out
