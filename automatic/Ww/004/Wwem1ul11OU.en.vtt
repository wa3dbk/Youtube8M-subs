00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.190 

this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> technique<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.150> seems<00:00:09.719> simple

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
this is a technique that seems simple

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.910 
this is a technique that seems simple
and<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> little<00:00:12.750> tricky<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and it is but it's a little tricky and I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.609 
and it is but it's a little tricky and I
call<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:16.250> smush<00:00:17.250> technique<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
call it a a smush technique and

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.050 
call it a a smush technique and
basically<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.400> taking<00:00:20.850> two

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
basically what that is is taking two

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
basically what that is is taking two
colors<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> four<00:00:22.109> inch<00:00:22.230> chip<00:00:22.529> brush<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
colors with a four inch chip brush and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
colors with a four inch chip brush and
working<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.210> together<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> I've<00:00:25.949> already

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
working them together so I've already

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
working them together so I've already
based<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.670> my<00:00:26.880> board<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> color<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
based up my board with the color that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
based up my board with the color that
ultimately<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> color<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
ultimately will be the color of the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.310 
ultimately will be the color of the
finish<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:32.399> using<00:00:33.140> Crescent<00:00:34.140> bronze

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
finish and I'm using Crescent bronze

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.350 
finish and I'm using Crescent bronze
chroma<00:00:34.620> tone<00:00:34.920> pale<00:00:35.250> gold<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.140> just<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.380> brown

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
chroma tone pale gold and just a brown

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
chroma tone pale gold and just a brown
latex<00:00:39.360> eggshell<00:00:39.600> paint<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.160> I'll<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
latex eggshell paint so what I'll do is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.990 
latex eggshell paint so what I'll do is
dip<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> brush<00:00:42.510> into<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.620> latex<00:00:44.129> paint<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
dip the brush into the latex paint the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
dip the brush into the latex paint the
brown<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.719> again<00:00:46.590> I'll<00:00:46.950> work<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> two

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
foot by two foot area and then dip my

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.439 
foot by two foot area and then dip my
brush<00:00:56.309> into<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:57.239> gold<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
brush into my gold just a little bit and

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
brush into my gold just a little bit and
what<00:01:00.449> I'll<00:01:00.600> end<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.109> doing<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.649> sort<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
what I'll end up doing is sort of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.280 
what I'll end up doing is sort of
stippling<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> brown<00:01:06.110> making<00:01:07.110> sure

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
stippling it into the brown making sure

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
stippling it into the brown making sure
that<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.560> turning<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.040> brush<00:01:08.780> constantly<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that I'm turning my brush constantly so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.410 
that I'm turning my brush constantly so
that<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.380> getting<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:11.130> leaving<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> same

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that I'm not getting or leaving the same

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.370 
that I'm not getting or leaving the same
impression<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.070> brush<00:01:14.280> position<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.380> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
impression of the brush position and I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.340 
impression of the brush position and I
have<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> mid-tone

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
have a mid-tone

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.290 
have a mid-tone
that<00:01:18.920> I'm<00:01:19.040> left<00:01:19.310> with<00:01:19.550> but<00:01:19.940> I'll<00:01:20.060> come<00:01:20.270> back

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
that I'm left with but I'll come back

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:30.210 
that I'm left with but I'll come back
with<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.750> little<00:01:21.020> more<00:01:21.110> gold<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.530> highlight<00:01:21.950> it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.180 

so<00:01:31.220> keeping<00:01:31.580> my<00:01:31.670> wet<00:01:31.820> edge<00:01:32.890> I'll<00:01:33.890> start

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
so keeping my wet edge I'll start

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.830 
so keeping my wet edge I'll start
working<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.760> fan<00:01:36.280> configuration<00:01:37.840> top-left

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
working in a fan configuration top-left

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.330 
working in a fan configuration top-left
corner<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> right<00:01:39.740> then<00:01:40.040> I'll<00:01:40.130> go<00:01:40.310> down

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
corner to the right then I'll go down

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.540 
corner to the right then I'll go down
below<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.710> top-left<00:01:43.190> corner<00:01:45.220> I'm<00:01:46.220> really

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
below the top-left corner I'm really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.820 
below the top-left corner I'm really
working<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.270> side<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.690> my<00:01:47.810> brush<00:01:48.050> this<00:01:48.380> corner

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
working the side of my brush this corner

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.940 
working the side of my brush this corner
edge<00:01:49.060> not<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.180> flat<00:01:50.390> side<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.869> not<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.140> front

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
edge not the flat side and not the front

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:26.680 
edge not the flat side and not the front
side<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:52.630> kind<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.780> corner

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.460 

okay<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:29.520> what<00:02:29.850> Smosh<00:02:30.180> looks<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.630> it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
okay so this is what Smosh looks like it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.880 
okay so this is what Smosh looks like it
can<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:33.060> look<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.390> an<00:02:33.540> old<00:02:33.870> leather<00:02:34.260> or<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
can have the look of an old leather or a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.840 
can have the look of an old leather or a
patina

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
patina

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.470 
patina
hammered<00:02:36.510> metal<00:02:37.580> but<00:02:38.580> again<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.180> another

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
hammered metal but again this is another

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590 
hammered metal but again this is another
very<00:02:40.110> durable<00:02:40.350> finish<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.490> can<00:02:41.760> scrub

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
very durable finish that you can scrub

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.040 
very durable finish that you can scrub
on<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.520> it's<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.670> forgiving<00:02:45.090> finish<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:45.810> walls

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
on and it's a forgiving finish for walls

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.430 
on and it's a forgiving finish for walls
that<00:02:46.290> might<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.800> perfect
