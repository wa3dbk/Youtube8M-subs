00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
nice the next morning I woke up and I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
nice the next morning I woke up and I
could<00:01:30.390> smell<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> DHA<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
could smell a little bit of DHA but it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.580 
could smell a little bit of DHA but it
wasn't<00:01:32.280> anything<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.850> bad<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> smell<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
wasn't anything too bad so the smell is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.380 
wasn't anything too bad so the smell is
pretty<00:01:34.740> decent

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
pretty decent

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
pretty decent
like<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.540> said<00:01:36.600> putting<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like I said putting it on can be kind of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
like I said putting it on can be kind of
difficult<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.850> guides<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.180> little

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
difficult because it guides a little

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.319 
difficult because it guides a little
watery<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.040> would<00:01:41.400> suggest<00:01:41.610> using<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
watery so I would suggest using a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
watery so I would suggest using a
tanning<00:01:42.600> mitt<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.020> putting<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.560> on

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
tanning mitt when putting this one on

can drip it takes a few seconds to rub
into<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> skin<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> guide<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
dark once I had it on it looked kind of

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.830 
dark once I had it on it looked kind of
green<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> guide<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.600> that'll

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
green because of the guide but that'll

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
green because of the guide but that'll
wash<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> next<00:01:58.680> morning<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
wash off the next morning so just be

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.090 
wash off the next morning so just be
very<00:02:00.719> careful<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:01.890> applying

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
very careful with when you're applying

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
very careful with when you're applying
this<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.840> pretty

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
this one because it it can get pretty

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
this one because it it can get pretty
messy

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
messy

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
messy
it<00:02:05.100> took<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:06.030> 20<00:02:06.479> minutes<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> completely

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it took about 20 minutes to completely

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
it took about 20 minutes to completely
dry<00:02:07.649> which<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> little<00:02:08.369> longer<00:02:08.700> than<00:02:08.849> most

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
dry which is a little longer than most

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.580 
dry which is a little longer than most
mousse<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> usually<00:02:09.929> take<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.379> think

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
mousse is usually take and I think

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.020 
mousse is usually take and I think
that's<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.670> watery

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that's because of the more watery

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's because of the more watery
consistency

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
consistency

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
consistency
so<00:02:14.130> about<00:02:14.310> 20<00:02:14.640> minutes<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.030> I'd<00:02:15.120> wait<00:02:15.330> for

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so about 20 minutes and I'd wait for

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
so about 20 minutes and I'd wait for
that<00:02:15.840> full<00:02:16.140> 20<00:02:16.470> minutes<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.220> sure

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that full 20 minutes just to make sure

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.710 
that full 20 minutes just to make sure
that<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> doesn't<00:02:17.850> stay<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.270> your<00:02:18.450> clothes

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that it doesn't stay in your clothes

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.300 
that it doesn't stay in your clothes
when<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:19.020> put<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.500> put<00:02:19.740> them<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:19.950> or

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
when they put when you put them on or

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.280 
when they put when you put them on or
when<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> sit<00:02:21.030> down<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.270> anything<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.020> doesn't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
when you sit down on anything it doesn't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.980 
when you sit down on anything it doesn't
stain<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.300> very<00:02:24.330> careful<00:02:24.720> while

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
stain it so just be very careful while

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.060 
stain it so just be very careful while
you're<00:02:25.110> waiting<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.860> dry

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
you're waiting for this one to dry

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610 
you're waiting for this one to dry
completely<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.730> well<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.930> color<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.410> one

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
completely as well the color this one

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.160 
completely as well the color this one
produced<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.190> actually<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.850> really<00:02:30.480> dark<00:02:30.840> shade

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
produced is actually a really dark shade

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
produced is actually a really dark shade
and<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.860> liked<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:33.270> aren't<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and I like I liked it so there aren't a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.090 
and I like I liked it so there aren't a
lot<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> self<00:02:34.320> tanners<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.070> I

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
lot of self tanners out there that I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.890 
lot of self tanners out there that I
think<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.610> pretty<00:02:35.820> dark<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.300> dark<00:02:36.330> enough<00:02:36.690> for

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
think are pretty dark or dark enough for

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.840 
think are pretty dark or dark enough for
my<00:02:37.020> liking<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.280> one<00:02:38.460> got<00:02:38.640> me

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
my liking and this this one got me

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.750 
my liking and this this one got me
pretty<00:02:39.150> dark<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> color<00:02:40.710> but<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.550> was

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
pretty dark I like the color but it was

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.790 
pretty dark I like the color but it was
so<00:02:42.120> streaky<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.990> one<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> most<00:02:43.380> streaky

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so streaky it's one of the most streaky

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.130 
so streaky it's one of the most streaky
self-tanners<00:02:44.370> I've<00:02:44.520> ever<00:02:44.700> tried<00:02:45.000> my<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.990> back

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
self-tanners I've ever tried my the back

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.960 
self-tanners I've ever tried my the back
of<00:02:46.320> my<00:02:46.380> legs<00:02:46.620> had<00:02:46.830> streaks<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.610> way<00:02:47.730> down

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
of my legs had streaks all the way down

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910 
of my legs had streaks all the way down
them<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.230> doesn't<00:02:49.500> usually<00:02:49.620> happen

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
them and that doesn't usually happen

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.470 
them and that doesn't usually happen
when<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> apply<00:02:50.580> self<00:02:50.910> tanners<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.300> pretty

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
when I apply self tanners I'm pretty

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.570 
when I apply self tanners I'm pretty
good<00:02:51.630> at<00:02:51.690> applying<00:02:52.050> them<00:02:52.260> by<00:02:52.380> now<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:53.220> was

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
good at applying them by now so it was

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.980 
good at applying them by now so it was
just<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:53.940> streaky<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.450> would<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.720> ranked

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
just really streaky I would have ranked

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.840 
just really streaky I would have ranked
this<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.320> higher<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.890> wasn't<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.370> streaky

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
this one higher if it wasn't so streaky

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.880 
this one higher if it wasn't so streaky
I<00:02:57.060> wasn't<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.600> fan<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.990> streaks<00:02:58.380> but<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> was

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
I wasn't a fan of the streaks but I was

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.250 
I wasn't a fan of the streaks but I was
a<00:02:58.920> fan<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.370> color<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:00.930> wasn't

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
a fan of the color so if it just wasn't

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.460 
a fan of the color so if it just wasn't
so<00:03:01.380> streaky<00:03:01.710> it'd<00:03:01.800> be<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.160> nice<00:03:02.430> color

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
so streaky it'd be a really nice color

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.990 
so streaky it'd be a really nice color
like<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.590> mentioned<00:03:04.950> earlier<00:03:05.070> there<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.580> one

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
like I mentioned earlier there is a one

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
like I mentioned earlier there is a one
shade<00:03:06.300> darker<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> can't<00:03:06.930> even<00:03:07.110> imagine<00:03:07.200> how

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
shade darker I can't even imagine how

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.020 
shade darker I can't even imagine how
dark<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.980> one<00:03:08.190> would<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.520> kind<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.850> want<00:03:09.000> to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
dark that one would be I kind of want to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.540 
dark that one would be I kind of want to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
tricks I don't know if that one's this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.440 
tricks I don't know if that one's this
tricky<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.070> one<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> guess<00:03:23.489> I'm<00:03:23.880> guessing

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
tricky is this one I guess I'm guessing

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140 
tricky is this one I guess I'm guessing
it<00:03:24.540> probably<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.700> lasted<00:03:27.060> about

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
it probably is this one lasted about

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.390 
it probably is this one lasted about
four<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.660> five<00:03:27.840> days<00:03:28.110> before<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> started<00:03:29.100> to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
four to five days before it started to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
four to five days before it started to
fade<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.720> faded<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.170> got<00:03:31.350> pretty<00:03:31.560> scaly

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
fade and as it faded I got pretty scaly

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.820 
fade and as it faded I got pretty scaly
my<00:03:33.420> skin<00:03:33.690> kind<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.080> looked<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.380> little<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.770> a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
my skin kind of looked a little like a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.830 
my skin kind of looked a little like a
reptile<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.910> was<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.209> scaly<00:03:36.570> I've

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
reptile because it was so scaly I've

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.470 
reptile because it was so scaly I've
noticed<00:03:37.200> with<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> darker<00:03:38.010> self-tanners<00:03:38.640> my

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
noticed with the darker self-tanners my

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.570 
noticed with the darker self-tanners my
skin<00:03:39.870> gets<00:03:40.110> more<00:03:40.350> scaly<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.220> think<00:03:41.340> it's

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
skin gets more scaly so I think it's

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.430 
skin gets more scaly so I think it's
just<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> potency<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.930> DHA

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
just because of the potency of the DHA

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
just because of the potency of the DHA
it<00:03:43.620> fades<00:03:43.950> more<00:03:44.340> drastically<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.019> lasted

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
it fades more drastically so it lasted

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.720 
it fades more drastically so it lasted
about<00:03:46.410> four<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.830> five<00:03:46.860> days<00:03:47.160> before<00:03:47.400> that

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
about four to five days before that

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.570 
about four to five days before that
started<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.180> happen<00:03:48.590> men<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.920> don't<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.459> if

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
started to happen men I don't know if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.740 
started to happen men I don't know if
you're<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.510> one

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you're going to really like this one

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.990 
you're going to really like this one
it's<00:03:52.350> just<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.830> streak<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.760> price

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's just to streak and for the price

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.350 
it's just to streak and for the price
it's<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.690> expensive<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:56.459> does<00:03:56.700> give<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> dark

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
it's so expensive it does give a dark

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.330 
it's so expensive it does give a dark
tan<00:03:57.660> but<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.290> said<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.620> streets<00:03:58.950> kind<00:03:59.220> of

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
tan but like I said the streets kind of

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.580 
tan but like I said the streets kind of
counteract<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.880> nice<00:04:00.180> tan<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:01.290> it

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
counteract that nice tan because it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.440 
counteract that nice tan because it
looks<00:04:01.769> pretty<00:04:02.010> bad<00:04:02.190> once<00:04:02.550> once<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.150> apply<00:04:03.420> it

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
looks pretty bad once once you apply it

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.540 
looks pretty bad once once you apply it
you're<00:04:03.750> pretty<00:04:03.989> streaky

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
you're pretty streaky

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.040 
you're pretty streaky
