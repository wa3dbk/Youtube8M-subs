that<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.819> they<00:02:12.970> may<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.450> may<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.930> one

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
that but they may it may just be one

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.220 
that but they may it may just be one
really<00:02:14.770> big<00:02:15.370> nice<00:02:15.730> commemorative<00:02:16.450> set<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.959> I
