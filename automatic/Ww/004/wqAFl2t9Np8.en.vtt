00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
thing but actually why performance wise

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.749 
thing but actually why performance wise
well<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.870> old<00:04:21.019> girls<00:04:21.289> still<00:04:21.650> got<00:04:22.009> it<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.370> can

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
well the old girls still got it you can

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.760 
well the old girls still got it you can
put<00:04:22.970> your<00:04:23.120> foot<00:04:23.270> down<00:04:23.509> and<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.900> will<00:04:24.080> just<00:04:24.410> fly

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
put your foot down and it will just fly

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.740 
put your foot down and it will just fly
but<00:04:25.070> there<00:04:25.190> are<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.340> couple<00:04:25.460> little<00:04:25.910> caveats<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
but there are a couple little caveats to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.620 
but there are a couple little caveats to
that<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:28.039> throttle<00:04:28.550> well<00:04:28.759> is<00:04:29.030> kind<00:04:29.389> of<00:04:29.479> like<00:04:29.599> a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
that the throttle well is kind of like a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.390 
that the throttle well is kind of like a
creme<00:04:29.930> brulee<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.470> have<00:04:30.560> quite<00:04:30.710> tapped

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
creme brulee so you have quite tapped

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.969 
creme brulee so you have quite tapped
through<00:04:31.849> the<00:04:32.720> hard<00:04:32.990> shell<00:04:33.259> who<00:04:33.590> gets<00:04:33.830> the

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
through the hard shell who gets the

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.800 
through the hard shell who gets the
creamy<00:04:34.250> deliciousness<00:04:34.789> well<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.479> kind<00:04:35.780> of

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
creamy deliciousness well it's kind of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.870 
creamy deliciousness well it's kind of
like<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.289> kind<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.500> hard<00:04:37.039> to<00:04:37.190> push<00:04:37.580> down

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
like that it's kind of hard to push down

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.900 
like that it's kind of hard to push down
after<00:04:38.599> 30<00:04:38.870> odd<00:04:39.050> years<00:04:39.289> but<00:04:39.440> when<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.680> do<00:04:39.910> you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
after 30 odd years but when you do you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.330 
after 30 odd years but when you do you
start<00:04:41.210> going<00:04:41.389> quite<00:04:41.780> quickly<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.530> engine

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
start going quite quickly the engine

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:52.360 
start going quite quickly the engine
noise<00:04:43.490> well<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:45.190> like

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.990 

I<00:04:56.110> kind<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.169> like<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.530> what<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> testament<00:04:58.940> to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
I kind of like that what a testament to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.080 
I kind of like that what a testament to
BMWs<00:04:59.660> engineers<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:00.260> held<00:05:00.590> up<00:05:00.770> for<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:01.580> long

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
BMWs engineers it's held up for so long

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.990 
BMWs engineers it's held up for so long
also<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:03.020> gearbox<00:05:03.500> our<00:05:03.680> dogleg<00:05:04.130> one<00:05:04.370> ideal

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
also the gearbox our dogleg one ideal

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.909 
also the gearbox our dogleg one ideal
for<00:05:05.240> racing<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.840> thing<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.410> m1<00:05:06.740> was

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
for racing the thing is the m1 was

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.219 
for racing the thing is the m1 was
designed<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.370> race<00:05:07.610> in<00:05:07.850> GT<00:05:08.540> championships

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
designed to race in GT championships

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.860 
designed to race in GT championships
with<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.470> problem<00:05:10.130> is<00:05:10.300> just<00:05:11.300> before<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.750> was

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
with the problem is just before it was

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.129 
with the problem is just before it was
launched<00:05:12.410> well<00:05:12.650> that<00:05:13.400> changed<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.850> rules<00:05:14.139> so

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
launched well that changed the rules so

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.560 
launched well that changed the rules so
the<00:05:15.530> m1<00:05:15.860> couldn't<00:05:16.280> enter<00:05:16.580> anything<00:05:17.030> which<00:05:17.540> is

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
the m1 couldn't enter anything which is

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.900 
the m1 couldn't enter anything which is
why<00:05:17.750> BMW<00:05:18.440> created<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.949> pro<00:05:19.280> car<00:05:19.639> which<00:05:19.850> is

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
why BMW created a pro car which is

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.469 
why BMW created a pro car which is
basically<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.510> 1<00:05:20.720> make<00:05:20.960> m1<00:05:21.500> racing<00:05:22.040> series

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
basically a 1 make m1 racing series

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.700 
basically a 1 make m1 racing series
eventually<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.870> sports<00:05:24.169> car<00:05:24.440> championship

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
eventually the sports car championship

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.219 
eventually the sports car championship
rules<00:05:25.280> were<00:05:25.400> changed<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:26.060> BMW<00:05:26.600> could<00:05:26.900> take

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
rules were changed and BMW could take

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.790 
rules were changed and BMW could take
the<00:05:27.770> m1<00:05:28.160> racing<00:05:28.700> for<00:05:29.300> real<00:05:29.630> pro<00:05:30.200> current<00:05:30.590> self

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
the m1 racing for real pro current self

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.920 
the m1 racing for real pro current self
is<00:05:30.950> pretty<00:05:31.190> common<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:31.760> has<00:05:31.940> 270<00:05:32.840> or

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
is pretty common this has 270 or

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.290 
is pretty common this has 270 or
breakers<00:05:33.350> standard<00:05:33.800> with<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.040> pro<00:05:34.280> cars<00:05:34.580> with

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
breakers standard with the pro cars with

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.330 
breakers standard with the pro cars with
added<00:05:35.690> giant<00:05:36.110> turbo<00:05:36.910> they<00:05:37.910> had<00:05:38.320> 850<00:05:39.340> that's

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
added giant turbo they had 850 that's

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.460 
added giant turbo they had 850 that's
quite<00:05:40.729> scary<00:05:41.120> because<00:05:41.389> this<00:05:41.780> thing

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
quite scary because this thing
