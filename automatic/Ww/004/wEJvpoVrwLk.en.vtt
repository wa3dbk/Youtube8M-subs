this is the weather stripping that I
want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.369> door<00:00:26.699> it's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
actually a silicone weather stripping it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
actually a silicone weather stripping it
comes<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.490> different<00:00:29.820> sizes<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
comes in a lot of different sizes and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.659 
comes in a lot of different sizes and
shapes<00:00:30.619> depending<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> gap<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.640> need

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
shapes depending on the gap that we need

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
shapes depending on the gap that we need
to<00:00:32.910> fill<00:00:33.210> around<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.840> door<00:00:34.140> now<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to fill around your door now a lot of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.290 
to fill around your door now a lot of
people<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.579> weather<00:00:35.820> stripping

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
people think that weather stripping

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
people think that weather stripping
should<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.630> compressed<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:38.040> tight<00:00:38.309> when

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
should be compressed really tight when

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
should be compressed really tight when
the<00:00:38.790> door<00:00:38.969> closes<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.260> wrong<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the door closes but that's wrong it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
the door closes but that's wrong it
should<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.129> compressed<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:41.879> 65<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> 85

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
should be compressed about 65 to 85

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
should be compressed about 65 to 85
percent<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.640> makes<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.270> energy<00:00:45.660> seal

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
percent that makes a good energy seal

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
percent that makes a good energy seal
and<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> allows<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> weather<00:00:47.430> stripping<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
and it allows the weather stripping to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
and it allows the weather stripping to
last<00:00:48.239> longer

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
last longer

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830 
last longer
now<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.280> weather<00:00:50.610> stripping<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.570> goes

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
now this weather stripping actually goes

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.529 
now this weather stripping actually goes
in<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> groove<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.489> barb<00:00:53.850> fits<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
in a groove right here this barb fits in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
in a groove right here this barb fits in
a<00:00:54.660> groove<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.649> around<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.340> jamb

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a groove that has to go around the jamb

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
a groove that has to go around the jamb
to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.050> groove<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> use

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to make that groove I'm going to use

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.939 
to make that groove I'm going to use
this<00:00:59.070> tool<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.289> it's<00:01:01.289> called<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
this tool right here it's called a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
this tool right here it's called a
corner<00:01:02.520> grooving<00:01:03.090> tool<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.660> actually<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
corner grooving tool it's actually a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
corner grooving tool it's actually a
router<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> special<00:01:05.250> tip<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.299> base

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
router with a special tip and the base

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
router with a special tip and the base
is<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> 45<00:01:07.830> degree<00:01:07.860> angle<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is actually at a 45 degree angle so the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.220 
is actually at a 45 degree angle so the
router<00:01:09.240> sits<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.229> perfectly

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.540 

now<00:01:17.230> I'm<00:01:17.350> ready<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.710> install<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.340> weather

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
now I'm ready to install the weather

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.160

weather<00:01:56.800> stripping<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.369> see<00:01:57.670> how<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.030> feels

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
weather stripping to see how it feels

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.500 
weather stripping to see how it feels
because<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.140> can't<00:01:59.560> see<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.070> compress<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.000> it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
because I can't see it compress and it

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.030 
because I can't see it compress and it
feels<00:02:01.810> pretty<00:02:02.110> good<00:02:02.320> there<00:02:02.500> wasn't<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.800> lot<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
feels pretty good there wasn't a lot of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.710 
feels pretty good there wasn't a lot of
tension<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> door<00:02:03.820> when<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.119> closed<00:02:04.479> it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
tension on the door when I closed it

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.930 
tension on the door when I closed it
next<00:02:05.350> thing<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.010> look<00:02:06.220> at<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> gap<00:02:06.670> that

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
next thing is as I look at the gap that

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.389 
next thing is as I look at the gap that
goes<00:02:07.090> down<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.630> side<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> door<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.740> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
goes down this side of the door and the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.820 
goes down this side of the door and the
gap<00:02:09.610> looks<00:02:10.030> pretty<00:02:10.330> small<00:02:10.660> all<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.320> way<00:02:11.470> down

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
gap looks pretty small all the way down

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.160 
gap looks pretty small all the way down
to<00:02:12.160> about<00:02:12.300> 3/4<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> way<00:02:13.630> down<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.050> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
to about 3/4 of the way down then it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.050 
to about 3/4 of the way down then it
gets<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.560> bigger<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.550> what<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> think<00:02:15.850> I'm

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
gets a little bigger so what I think I'm

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.370 
gets a little bigger so what I think I'm
going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.209> do<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.540> I'm<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> use<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.140> same
