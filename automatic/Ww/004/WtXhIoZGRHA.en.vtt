00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550 
it's not arrived yet and it will take
some<00:01:49.280> time<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.700> arrive<00:01:49.970> but<00:01:50.720> when<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.080> does<00:01:51.260> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
some time to arrive but when it does it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160 
some time to arrive but when it does it
simply<00:01:52.160> won't<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.910> a<00:01:52.940> tracker<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.540> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
simply won't have a tracker on it it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.840 
simply won't have a tracker on it it
won't<00:01:54.440> be<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.680> mini-map<00:01:54.950> for<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.369> you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
won't be on the mini-map for you you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.359 
won't be on the mini-map for you you
will<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.450> with<00:01:56.720> no<00:01:56.930> tracker<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.650> as<00:01:58.250> you

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
will see it with no tracker and as you

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.520 
will see it with no tracker and as you
see<00:01:58.490> there<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:59.360> Franklin's<00:01:59.840> Buffalo's<00:02:00.320> right

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
see there my Franklin's Buffalo's right

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.530 
see there my Franklin's Buffalo's right
there<00:02:00.770> no<00:02:01.160> tracker<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.729> being<00:02:01.910> placed<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.360> it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
there no tracker is being placed on it

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.870 
there no tracker is being placed on it
so<00:02:02.900> therefore<00:02:03.170> any<00:02:03.619> person<00:02:04.220> can<00:02:04.369> get<00:02:04.550> inside

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
so therefore any person can get inside

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.990 
so therefore any person can get inside
of<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.380> take<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.410> into<00:02:06.680> their<00:02:06.920> garage<00:02:07.310> so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
of it and take it into their garage so

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.540 
of it and take it into their garage so
as<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.149> see<00:02:08.450> here<00:02:08.830> they<00:02:09.830> are<00:02:09.890> taking<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.340> into

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
as you see here they are taking it into

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.490 
as you see here they are taking it into
the<00:02:10.640> garage<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.209> look<00:02:11.840> they<00:02:12.080> actually

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the garage and look they actually

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.410 
the garage and look they actually
managed<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.800> put<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.760> into<00:02:13.970> their<00:02:14.120> galleries

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
managed to put it into their galleries

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.720 
managed to put it into their galleries
it<00:02:14.540> was<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> exact<00:02:15.110> same<00:02:15.320> car<00:02:15.590> which<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.490> drove

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
it was the exact same car which I drove

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.820 
it was the exact same car which I drove
out<00:02:16.940> when<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.660> basically<00:02:17.930> duplicated<00:02:18.800> for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
out when so it basically duplicated for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.610 
out when so it basically duplicated for
them<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.280> now<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.690> basically<00:02:21.140> probably<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
them and now it's basically probably the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.110 
them and now it's basically probably the
best<00:02:21.830> duplication<00:02:22.489> glitch<00:02:22.519> out<00:02:22.820> there<00:02:23.000> at<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
best duplication glitch out there at the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.670 
best duplication glitch out there at the
moment<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.690> doesn't<00:02:23.930> cost<00:02:24.080> any<00:02:24.500> money

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
moment as it doesn't cost any money

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.949 
moment as it doesn't cost any money
apart<00:02:25.640> from<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.970> corner<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> tank<00:02:26.780> and

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
apart from a corner of the tank and

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.259 
apart from a corner of the tank and
probably<00:02:27.230> buying<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.550> will<00:02:28.790> help

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
probably buying it but that will help

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.880 
probably buying it but that will help
you<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.780> long<00:02:29.810> run<00:02:29.989> for<00:02:30.200> duplicate

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
you out in the long run for duplicate

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
you out in the long run for duplicate
cards<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.300> like<00:02:32.630> to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
cards and all that but I just like to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.240 
cards and all that but I just like to
say<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> am<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.260> founder<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.560> ass<00:02:33.739> clench<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.160> if

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
duplication glitch i'm probably the best

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.910 
duplication glitch i'm probably the best
one<00:02:47.180> at<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.390> moment<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.350> said<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.769> don't
