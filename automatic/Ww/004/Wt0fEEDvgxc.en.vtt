00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
of course it was a lot more work than

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.679 
of course it was a lot more work than

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
next time we know what to do basically

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.020 
next time we know what to do basically
we<00:01:24.439> had<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.770> made<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.070> lid<00:01:25.250> part<00:01:25.579> and<00:01:25.850> then

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
figured out how to do that but Robin

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.069 
figured out how to do that but Robin
made<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.250> little<00:01:31.430> extra<00:01:31.880> cardboard<00:01:32.450> attaching

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
made a little extra cardboard attaching

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.929 
made a little extra cardboard attaching
it<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:35.140> Pilar's<00:01:36.789> going<00:01:37.789> in

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
it to that and then Pilar's going in

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.069 
it to that and then Pilar's going in
this<00:01:38.600> way<00:01:38.960> not<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.799> way<00:01:40.119> but<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.450> way<00:01:41.509> three

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
this way not this way but this way three

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.560 
this way not this way but this way three
pillars<00:01:42.640> we're<00:01:43.640> stuck<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.149> board<00:01:44.420> and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
pillars we're stuck on the board and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.690 
pillars we're stuck on the board and
then<00:01:44.659> there<00:01:44.840> indicate<00:01:45.320> like<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.740> like<00:01:46.609> I

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
then there indicate like that like I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.039 
then there indicate like that like I
said<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:47.000> could<00:01:47.119> be<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.270> little<00:01:47.420> neater<00:01:47.719> but

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
said it could be a little neater but

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.429 
said it could be a little neater but
this<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:48.859> have<00:01:49.869> there<00:01:50.869> was<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.170> gold

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
this is what we have there was some gold

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
this is what we have there was some gold
accents

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
accents

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:08.109 
accents
so<00:01:55.090> hopefully<00:01:55.540> she'll<00:01:55.810> like<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:57.540> Tata<00:01:58.540> for<00:01:58.900> now

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.179
