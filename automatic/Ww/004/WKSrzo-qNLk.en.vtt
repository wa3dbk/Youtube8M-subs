00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
every time you pull this across will get

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
every time you pull this across will get
jammed<00:03:08.790> into<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.209> corner<00:03:09.600> what<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.410> does

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
jammed into this corner what that does

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.680 
jammed into this corner what that does
is<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.980> starts<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.400> build<00:03:11.580> up<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.090> then<00:03:12.510> your

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
is it starts to build up and then your

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.180 
is it starts to build up and then your
magnets<00:03:13.170> don't<00:03:13.320> want<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.620> hold<00:03:13.769> each<00:03:14.010> other

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
magnets don't want to hold each other

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.710 
magnets don't want to hold each other
tight<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.150> will<00:03:15.269> happen<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.570> when<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
tight and what will happen is when a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.780 
tight and what will happen is when a
stiff<00:03:15.989> breeze<00:03:16.260> comes<00:03:16.650> by<00:03:16.860> it'll<00:03:17.640> actually

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
stiff breeze comes by it'll actually

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.940 
stiff breeze comes by it'll actually

retract the door back into this canister

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.550 
retract the door back into this canister
and<00:03:20.480> you'll<00:03:21.480> wonder<00:03:21.720> why<00:03:21.840> your<00:03:22.140> door<00:03:22.320> keeps
