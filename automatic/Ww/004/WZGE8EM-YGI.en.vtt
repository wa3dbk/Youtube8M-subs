00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.670
 bfm business until 12:30 pm 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.100
 placement the issue 100% investment 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.260
 cédric decoeur guillaume sommerer we go 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.940
 now conjure up the gold prices of 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.560
 course in the heart of the controversy 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.789
 we talk about it with jean-françois very handsome 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.009
 day jean-françois hello guillaume 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.869
 jean cédric you are the president of 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.210
 safe points like the courses that have 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.669
 decreased by 6% since January 1st 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320
 is currently at 1592 dollars an ounce 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.669
 when we look at the graphical thresholds 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.720
 like that we say that it will continue to 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.239
 lower or on the contrary we will see a 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.000
 price rebound on the short term on 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.670
 left in a big bearish channel 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.270
 this channel is marked by support around 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.410
 of 1550 dollars and a resistance to mr 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.539
 1640 dollars so these limits are 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.109
 really to watch like milk on 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.109
 fire 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.770
 in the coming weeks, however, 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.590
 like Chinese and Russian 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 I think that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 the gold finally hold I think what he has 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 estimated too expensive a few months ago 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 should take advantage of this period of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.479
 breath recovery to return 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.610
 on or consolidate and strengthen 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.369
 and use support for 1550 dollars 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 so if how do you see them as 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.870
 insurance against crises 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.100
 you consider a this case your 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.660
 premium costs you a little bit cheaper 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.620
 right now okay okay but that 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.790
 that the central bankers the banks 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.650
 plants continue to buy gold 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.000
 are very active quite exactly 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.290
 I consider that the underpinnings 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 are there the central bankers the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.110
 mine extraction potential 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 low rates 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.820
 so all that is already in place for that 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.830
 the price of gold can go up 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.440
 so will he go back up strongly 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.810
 this year we did not totally 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.890
 some if used would do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.500
 graphical analysis 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 right now we are in a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.220
 a pattern called the pennant and the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.380
 pennant could tell us a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.560
 recovery in the beginning of the first 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 semester 2014 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 with then we project very far but 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.690
 bear and long term with the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.959
 records very very high around 2016 2017 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.340
 or 2018 that's so it's still daring 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.140
 to make predictions like that for 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.470
 2016 2018 when we do not know what will 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.390
 happen 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.010
 only as compared to the analysis 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.510
 graph because just now 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.450
 I'm going to bounce on other things that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.670
 tell us that unfortunately the course 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.989
 gold is very worked and not 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.700
 to work is what you want to work 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.110
 say manipulate because that's when 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.670
 even the big suspicions of the moment the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.930
 American regulators are thinking about 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.350
 open an investigation into a manipulation 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.459
 deco exactly indeed at this moment we 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.010
 has information coming in a year 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.769
 of the wall street journal that reports 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.840
 suspicion of manipulation of the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.819
 share of the big players 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.129
 of the gold quotation so these are 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.790
 several banks hsbc barclays deutsche 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.150
 bank etc 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 and it's an American organization the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.340
 the cftc nothing to do with the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.420
 trade unionists who question but 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.200
 for the moment we are wondering but 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.260
 does not accuse anyone 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.610
 that's the big the big paradise 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 wonders because this gold market 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.859
 is particularly opaque 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.290
 clearly it is really opaque the 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.409
 volumes of exchanged are complicated to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 know and it's really not going to 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.530
 use the word cartel but I would say 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.049
 that these banks shit years and whose 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.599
 they are structured to calculate and 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.909
 communicated the courses little things from 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.980
 filters so for example the example the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.019
 more talking to the uninitiated while 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.819
 simply the fall of 20% of the course that 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.319
 we had known in October 2008 in 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.049
 full stock market panic 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.129
 while at the same time the physical gold 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.750
 was becoming almost impossible to find 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.819
 to find or at prices totally 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.709
 delusional proof that people wanted 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.470
 immediately 2 at the truth including 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.019
 the big money makers and more recently 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.430
 a poutine advisor said he 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.470
 was aware that gold is 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.599
 artificially low and that it is the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.569
 why he bought them 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.169
 massively as well as the Chinese then 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.919
 today it goes on so why 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.650
 first of all you have to know that 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.060
 daily are between 500 and 800 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.579
 tons of gold that are traded but of 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.900
 paper gold means a quarter of the 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.560
 value of world production 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.269
 annual 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.190
 so we see that a shift we know very 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.229
 although there is something that is 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.650
 not good because of this the market to stay 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.030
 massively short sellers for 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.370
 maintain low prices that it would 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.010
 unable to assume a demand for 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.570
 physical counterpart by speaking true 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.190
 counterparty risk has totally 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.720
 totally 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.300
 besides, every time 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.190
 some organizations wanted 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.710
 recover physically at this time 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.770
 there the comex to a little smothered the sphere 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.820
 and has them calmed down so it's there 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 had something that was wrong 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.580
 so in big banks they have a 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.080
 role in his possible manipulations 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.150
 exactly because banks are 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.220
 responsible for the gold price because 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.330
 they are also the ones who those 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.720
 very broadly covered the decline e by his 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.580
 public debt redemption policy 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.460
 so no question of valuing and gold 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.990
 because it's an asset that because of 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.060
 its valuation would devalue 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.770
 therefore the reverse by this simple rise 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.110
 all currencies sterilize in the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.940
 liquidity trap the traps to the isic 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.320
 and the liquidity trap is these 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.820
 famous system that allows to do 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.770
 walk the billboard while 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.139
 avoiding massive inflation 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.340
 when we talk about manipulation often 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.860
 obviously in the reduced to 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.289
 who is profiting from the crime and who 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.950
 do not benefit in clear that is 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.349
 victim 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.270
 we saw that on the euribor 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.070
 Libor was not necessarily 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.050
 victims is what there on the course of 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.690
 gold there are some who are more but 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.639
 listen clearly to the price of gold 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.770
 he is worked on a daily basis by also 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.349
 well 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.810
 individuals from the managers of 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.340
 portfolios of small banks and 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.240
 big and so it's all who 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.470
 today buy edf and think that 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.050
 behind it is an underlying asset which is 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.050
 real or certificates etc are from 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.639
 all implicitly way to blur and 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.980
 it's a bit like when you 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.690
 buy 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.220
 a container with pure marked inside 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.639
 beef and that in the end you have the meat 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.680
 of horse horse so see one year 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.409
 we are exactly here after me 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.449
 makes me a little bounce is that the 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.400
 knows the Cftc had launched an investigation into 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.860
 two lords manipulations around the 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.099
 price of silver metal by jp morgan and 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.050
 she had dropped the charges 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.550
 the investigation four years later then this 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.340
 which extends as well as the cftc communicates 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.560
 on issues prior to 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.270
 the opening of any investigation so the 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.669
 translation that's what is said is 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.560
 said and this morning in our opposite 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.120
 morning these gentlemen bankers like 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.289
 it all becomes almost too big and 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.789
 that you just got caught 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.169
 on the cheat of libor cashel fast 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.819
 all the proofs of your packages because 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.319
 we will have to come and investigate 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.969
 ah yeah so as a banker near 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.469
 complicit regulator this is acquiring 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.569
 the has is not it's not a 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:56.909
 update but it's that quickly 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.020
 they will be calm anyway and 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.069
 in their game then to ten when the 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.330
 saying good here is which you have 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.740
 does your job you have alain weill 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.360
 hare now we will stay warm 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.669
 if we put a scarecrow we do not shoot 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.740
 still ferret obviously yes how 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.879
 protect yourself from manipulation of 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.189
 course ignored this really 30 seconds 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.779
 then three keys in 30 seconds 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.270
 any mother we are absolutely in 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:17.099
 the logic of buying physical gold 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.080
 that you tuna in the neck it is 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.599
 in the station from somewhere etc but that 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.279
 you are the owner so that 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.599
 you have a certificate that indicates that
