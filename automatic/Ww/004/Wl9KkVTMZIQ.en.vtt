00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 hello thank you very much for your time now 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.090
 let's prepare a chocolate syrup 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.370
 for some recipes that we have in case 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.940
 that does not have it but can not find in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
 the store or something 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.340
 we can prepare it in this house 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 way we're going to put three quarters of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.360
 cup of water in a pot we already put 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.170
 to warm 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.250
 and equal three quarters of a cup of sugar 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.250
 a half cup of cocoa powder 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.260
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 and that we are going to stir well until 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.339
 then to like beating 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.570
 that it becomes good and until 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:56.860
 start to almost boil in a term 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.130
 medium 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.970
 and as you can see it is already 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.970
 boiling 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.290
 that's why I'm already seeing you already see 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.540
 as 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.970
 start to enter and ready to turn off 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480
 and a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 alive 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.390
 half a spoonful of pod and ready 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.210
 and we already have our chocolate syrup 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.270
 what can be very hot depends on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 what we are going to use it or cool it and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.920
 store in the refrigerator for when 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.159
 I will use it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.159
 as you can see it came out 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.620
 very rich if you need more of this 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.630
 amount is only double the recipe 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.180
 the temperature can be medium 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.610
 medium high you have to be very careful 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.600
 for when it boils and be careful with 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.819
 the thickness also so that it is not done 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.019
 that's why neither does he see very thin 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.310
