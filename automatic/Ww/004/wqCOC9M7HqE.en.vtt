00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.539
 was traveling with the battleship 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.370
 one or the other situation at 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.930
 rank with luggage and social 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.220
 probably already asked 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.760

 reverse gear solution lakers excel means 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.130
 The product theme is extremely thoughtful of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.020
 the company becker if they follow completely 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 takes place mechanically via the accounting department 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.260
 not over others and actually 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.040
 tv-market fummelei the lever of gear 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.920
 to burn her fingers 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.550
 when creating the reverse gear completely 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.630
 safety aspects about the circuit 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.100
 century, of course, too 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.140
 considered it is not possible at the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 System accidental and price may too 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.469
 switch or the first and the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.480
 reverse gear 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.950
 The whole thing is about one 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.890
 Safety switch ensures that 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.290
 must be active to get out of the first gear 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.270
 to turn it on 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.799
 you have to imagine that in the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.380
 first gear to come to a full floor 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.530
 you have to get there before you even technically 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.609
 can engage the reverse gear 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.850
