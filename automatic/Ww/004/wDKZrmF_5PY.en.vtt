better<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> color<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.400> kind

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
better kind of color because it's kind

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

naturally but it's like a better color

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469

so when I have this on and looks very

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
so when I have this on and looks very
natural<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.990> doesn't<00:01:28.259> look<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.710> put<00:01:29.159> too

much<00:01:29.369> effort<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.810> makes<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.079> lips

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
much effort into it but it makes my lips

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.620 
they look very similar this one is I
think<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.240> bit<00:03:01.050> um<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:02.370> brighter<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.210> not<00:03:03.480> as

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
think a bit um like brighter it's not as

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.600 
think a bit um like brighter it's not as
natural-looking<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.550> course

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
natural-looking but you can of course

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.220 
natural-looking but you can of course
share<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.120> down<00:03:06.390> with<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> lip<00:03:06.870> gloss<00:03:06.900> or

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.320 
share it down with like a lip gloss or
something<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.880> other<00:03:09.090> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
something like that and the other one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.060

better than the covergirl one in the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.940

fact that it like comes close to it but
it's<00:03:47.310> really<00:03:47.610> really<00:03:47.940> sheer<00:03:48.330> like<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.380> comes

um so this one is by NYX and it's one of
their<00:05:11.800> liquid<00:05:12.250> lipsticks<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.360> looks<00:05:13.510> like

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
their liquid lipsticks so it looks like

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.450 
their liquid lipsticks so it looks like
a<00:05:13.660> lip<00:05:13.870> gloss<00:05:13.900> but<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:14.350> actually<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> lipstick

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
a lip gloss but it's actually a lipstick

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.730 
a lip gloss but it's actually a lipstick
and<00:05:15.700> it's<00:05:16.480> really<00:05:16.780> really<00:05:16.870> nice<00:05:17.260> it's<00:05:17.530> not

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
and it's really really nice it's not

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.840 
and it's really really nice it's not
shiny<00:05:18.130> it's<00:05:18.430> very<00:05:18.700> matte<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:20.280> it's<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.610> color

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
shiny it's very matte and it's a color

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.520 
shiny it's very matte and it's a color
that<00:05:22.030> lasts<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.450> long<00:05:22.570> time<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.080> really<00:05:23.290> is

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
that lasts a long time so it really is

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.690 
that lasts a long time so it really is
like<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.919> lipstick<00:05:24.250> but<00:05:24.400> it's<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:24.669> a

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
like a lipstick but it's like a

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.330 
like a lipstick but it's like a
moisturizing<00:05:25.450> sort<00:05:25.930> of<00:05:26.020> version<00:05:26.200> of<00:05:26.440> that<00:05:26.680> so

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
moisturizing sort of version of that so

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.390 
moisturizing sort of version of that so
this<00:05:27.700> color<00:05:27.940> is<00:05:28.210> called<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.930> zealand<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.710> the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
this color is called can zealand and the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.250 
this color is called can zealand and the
reason<00:05:30.700> that<00:05:30.790> i<00:05:30.850> think<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.690> this<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
reason that i think that this is the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.710 
reason that i think that this is the
least<00:05:32.700> like<00:05:33.700> maybelline<00:05:34.210> pink<00:05:34.390> please<00:05:34.540> is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
least like maybelline pink please is

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.380 
least like maybelline pink please is
because<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.169> so<00:05:35.470> bright<00:05:35.770> um<00:05:36.300> it's<00:05:37.300> very

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
because it's so bright um it's very

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.740 
because it's so bright um it's very
thick<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.200> yes<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.620> can<00:05:38.740> share<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:39.220> out

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
thick so yes you can share it out

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.380 
thick so yes you can share it out
totally<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.200> it's<00:05:41.770> i<00:05:42.520> think<00:05:42.580> really<00:05:43.240> really

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
totally but it's i think really really

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.050 
totally but it's i think really really
thick<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:44.230> it<00:05:44.560> comes<00:05:44.800> off<00:05:45.010> as<00:05:45.220> like<00:05:45.400> so<00:05:45.730> bright

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
thick so it comes off as like so bright

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.360 
thick so it comes off as like so bright
on<00:05:46.210> your<00:05:46.360> lips<00:05:46.570> but<00:05:47.020> obviously<00:05:47.980> you<00:05:48.070> can<00:05:48.220> just

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
on your lips but obviously you can just

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.310 
on your lips but obviously you can just
put<00:05:48.730> a<00:05:48.760> little<00:05:48.880> bit<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.510> on<00:05:49.540> so<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:49.990> won't<00:05:50.200> be

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
put a little bit of it on so it won't be

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.440 
put a little bit of it on so it won't be
as<00:05:50.470> bright<00:05:50.980> and<00:05:51.370> then<00:05:51.730> just<00:05:51.940> put<00:05:52.120> some<00:05:52.270> clear

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
as bright and then just put some clear

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.820 
as bright and then just put some clear
lip<00:05:52.660> gloss<00:05:52.810> on<00:05:52.840> top<00:05:53.200> or<00:05:53.350> sometimes<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.770> if

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
lip gloss on top or sometimes that if

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.830

half<00:06:34.150> empty<00:06:34.660> already<00:06:34.780> because<00:06:35.199> I've<00:06:35.349> used<00:06:35.590> it

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
half empty already because I've used it

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.890

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
so much this is by NYX and the color is

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.999 
so much this is by NYX and the color is
called<00:06:38.400> strawberry<00:06:39.400> and<00:06:39.639> it's<00:06:39.759> number<00:06:40.150> 11<00:06:41.009> so

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
called strawberry and it's number 11 so

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.499
