00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it'll have fish eye on it okay and this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
it'll have fish eye on it okay and this
is<00:01:31.259> two<00:01:32.070> four<00:01:32.340> seven<00:01:32.610> underscore<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is two four seven underscore one so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810

underscore<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> fisheye<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.670> could

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
underscore one has the fisheye I could

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.149 
underscore one has the fisheye I could
see<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> light<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.650> lamp<00:01:37.890> is

see right now that the light the lamp is
warped<00:01:39.110> okay<00:01:40.110> proceed<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.530> step<00:01:40.680> two<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
warped okay proceed to step two so this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
warped okay proceed to step two so this
is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.509> does<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.960> fisheye

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is the one that does not have fisheye

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.370 
is the one that does not have fisheye
and<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.659> does<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:45.990> fish
