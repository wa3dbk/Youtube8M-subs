me it's okay I don't have issues
blending<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> since<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.970> apply<00:01:18.240> edge

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
blending in since I just apply edge

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
blending in since I just apply edge
control<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.049> edges<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.500> am<00:01:19.619> natural<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.070> well

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
control so my edges i am natural as well

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
control so my edges i am natural as well
so<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.170> turn<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.619> away<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
so that did not turn me away from the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.620 
so that did not turn me away from the
hair<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.330> little

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
hair I just think that it is a little

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.980 
hair I just think that it is a little
bit<00:01:24.840> thinner<00:01:25.770> than<00:01:26.420> brazilian<00:01:27.420> hair<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
bit thinner than brazilian hair all it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
bit thinner than brazilian hair all it
does<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.890> hold<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.400> curl<00:01:29.640> beautifully

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
does it can hold a curl beautifully

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.710 
does it can hold a curl beautifully
right<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.430> had<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.610> too<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.180> brains

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
