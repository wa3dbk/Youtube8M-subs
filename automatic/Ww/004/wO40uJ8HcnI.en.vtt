00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello for a short tutorial too 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.980
 use hugo is a very nice one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.759
 utility to ep that too very 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289
 helpful to the plant and me 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.240
 use the fact at every 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.220
 movement sorry and i think many too 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 other 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 what do we have to do to use it well ? 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 first and foremost, 46 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 have installed on your computer with 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.180
 seven alone is not yet fixed 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.370
 has installed and 7 then it works 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 Look again better if that time 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:47.329
 open up and I have here now 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.329
 for example, to the tracks 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.360
 found and what others raised and the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.489
 I want to connect somehow now 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.270
 Of course I can guarantee that again 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.340
 Here comes a nice gates and take 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.890
 somehow peace of mind so that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.299
 Of course, somehow it does not fit that way 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 nice off white beaches just for that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.369
 in this case probably help at present 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.250
 let's rest on google 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.070
 It's best to start after 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 he was started 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 this is my opinion also already 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.850
 a special starter for that um 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.710
 the link drove to the old gp and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.690
 down 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.040
 and yes our window from home with 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.119
 Other options me today yet 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.899
 not busy forum that in apps entirely 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.690
 just mark in ep window that 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.990
 first track change to google and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.520
 Click on the button Kleister vor 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.190
 thus a guide all the data 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.930
 to calculate abdomen 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.330
 this dress in there are the whole thing with 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.910
 We also go against that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.269
 this time on track systems again the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.410
 attitudes and with that you see below 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:17.080
 is it with him could build such a you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.530
 now with two tracks you can do this 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 Set up 3 g / t and so on 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.540
 This is especially handy if you are 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 would like to have smooth cakes in this 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.510
 case offers two suffering it still makes him 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 Two action plan is your plan yours 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.739
 the same options as terrain rest 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.850
 touch the track 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.390
 that really only needs if you 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.420
 and mountainous areas would do what and then 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.079
 double-railed then hugo automatically builds 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.970
 a two-pronged stretch if you 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:54.489
 now this unequal connected and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.970
 connect these two little associations 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.340
 you want to click now leiÃŸling 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.109
 automatically sets buildings 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 has turned and already that 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.299
 track connection can be done is to 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.859
 pass through the system, of course, that the 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.709
 Do not go in the same direction 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.109
 Show that means in the horny you see 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.870
 in this green dot and every green 3 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.430
 the triangle notes the same start 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.980
 the end of the track is that the track day 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.239
 before and you have to do something else now 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.299
 imagine like a line we 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.120
 So perform this direction is 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.799
 once the line to the railway and 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.299
 goes to the end of the other sentence that 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.469
 sounds pretty complicated though 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.989
 not and if we have the money now 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.209
 just then we have in fact 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.030
 participate in the principle 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.949
 that means these lines would give but 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.319
 preferably changes to the other 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.730
 arriving at the track that means he is the same 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.159
 start we always get in the way 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.599
 to hear change 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.560
 that is, we mark the second one now 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.659
 again with paste after 50 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 minutes let start and built such a 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.739
 Funny stripes rain over the course 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.509
 not have 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.239
 that sounds like this little god in here 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:15.819
 dallas put the chicken in and 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.090
 click again right after that I have 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.330
 knows this spirit is turned and can 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 to restore this connection 19 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.970
 Prices are the same with the railway 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.720
 before that is depending on how about the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.020
 build from you that farmer with more profile 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.690
 use more 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.060
 also not said the main function 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.690
 I think from the top really all around 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.690
 had four
