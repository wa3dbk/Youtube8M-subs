00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
first of all I would say that what I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.990 
first of all I would say that what I
think<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.550> you're<00:01:20.670> probably<00:01:20.790> getting

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
getting looking for is is a sort of am

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
getting looking for is is a sort of am
you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.010> real<00:01:26.159> community<00:01:27.740> aspect<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you know as a real community aspect to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.270 
you know as a real community aspect to
what<00:01:29.370> you're<00:01:29.640> doing<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.010> know<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
what you're doing and and you know your

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.820 
what you're doing and and you know your
sort<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:33.409> community<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.440> medical

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
sort of getting a community of medical

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.039 
sort of getting a community of medical
professionals<00:01:35.340> hopefully<00:01:36.299> involved<00:01:36.750> i<00:01:36.840> think

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
professionals hopefully involved i think

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260 
professionals hopefully involved i think
and<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.549> i<00:01:38.580> would<00:01:38.670> say<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and so what i would say is that you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
and so what i would say is that you
don't<00:01:39.450> necessarily<00:01:39.630> need<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.350> keep<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> all

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
don't necessarily need to keep that all

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
don't necessarily need to keep that all
on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.960> all<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> website<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:45.030> might<00:01:45.180> want

valuable perhaps them at the top as i

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.370 
valuable perhaps them at the top as i
mentioned<00:02:05.970> bringing<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> forums<00:02:06.900> on<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.290> the

then<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.590> know<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.670> good

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
then then you know that's a really good

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.160 
then then you know that's a really good
way<00:04:33.940> because<00:04:34.510> they<00:04:34.720> don't<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.050> keep

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
way because they don't have to keep

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.880 
way because they don't have to keep
visiting<00:04:35.710> back<00:04:36.040> all<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.460> time<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.780> they<00:04:37.960> you

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
visiting back all the time but they you

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.990 
visiting back all the time but they you
know<00:04:38.920> this<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.280> way<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.460> keeping<00:04:39.640> them<00:04:39.850> up<00:04:39.970> to

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
know this is way of keeping them up to

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.780 
know this is way of keeping them up to
date<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.540> on<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.740> forum<00:04:42.250> topics<00:04:42.580> you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
could also potentially have you could

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.770 
could also potentially have you could
split<00:04:45.070> out<00:04:45.310> into<00:04:45.820> particular<00:04:46.150> kinds<00:04:46.690> of

split out into particular kinds of

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.050 
split out into particular kinds of
medicine<00:04:47.140> if<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.380> wanted<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.790> know<00:04:48.850> sort

of Pediatrics or care for the elderly or
whatever<00:04:53.470> yeah<00:04:53.680> because<00:04:53.890> obviously<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.910> lot<00:04:55.210> of

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
whatever yeah because obviously a lot of

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.230 
whatever yeah because obviously a lot of
people<00:04:55.420> aren't<00:04:55.660> involved<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:57.400> all<00:04:57.670> facets

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
people aren't involved in in all facets

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.790 
people aren't involved in in all facets
of<00:04:58.420> Medicine<00:04:58.900> they're<00:04:59.350> interested<00:04:59.770> in

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
of Medicine they're interested in

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.350 
of Medicine they're interested in
particular<00:05:00.040> market<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.730> that's<00:05:01.150> another

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
particular market so that's another

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.110 
particular market so that's another
thing<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:01.990> about<00:05:02.760> youtube<00:05:03.760> channel<00:05:04.030> as

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
thing to think about youtube channel as

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.310 
thing to think about youtube channel as
well<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.560> would<00:05:05.560> strongly<00:05:05.890> recommend<00:05:06.010> that<00:05:07.320> you

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
well I would strongly recommend that you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.960 
well I would strongly recommend that you
get<00:05:08.470> involved<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:08.860> YouTube<00:05:09.220> perhaps<00:05:09.610> it

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
get involved in YouTube perhaps it

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.220 
get involved in YouTube perhaps it
perhaps<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.480> don't<00:05:10.570> have<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.810> do<00:05:10.930> anything

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
perhaps you don't have to do anything

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.950 
perhaps you don't have to do anything
kind<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.680> too<00:05:12.310> crazy<00:05:12.820> or<00:05:12.970> technical<00:05:13.510> but<00:05:13.690> just

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
kind of too crazy or technical but just

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.090 
kind of too crazy or technical but just
a<00:05:14.880> small<00:05:15.880> short<00:05:16.690> video<00:05:17.020> perhaps<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.770> bit<00:05:17.890> like

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
a small short video perhaps a bit like

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.300 
a small short video perhaps a bit like
this<00:05:18.730> webinar<00:05:19.120> obviously<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.660> lot<00:05:19.930> shorter<00:05:20.350> the

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
this webinar obviously a lot shorter the

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.210 
this webinar obviously a lot shorter the

the time live on YouTube is 10 minutes

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.950 
the time live on YouTube is 10 minutes
but<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:26.050> could<00:05:26.200> create<00:05:26.440> as<00:05:26.710> very<00:05:26.920> short

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
but you you could create as very short

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.540 
but you you could create as very short
videos<00:05:28.960> with<00:05:30.120> with<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.150> little<00:05:31.480> bit<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.600> advice
