when<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.520> decided<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.060> get<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> medal<00:00:06.660> Turing

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
when I decided to get a medal Turing

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419 
when I decided to get a medal Turing
lathe<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.379> was<00:00:07.529> worried<00:00:07.830> about<00:00:07.890> undermining

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
lathe I was worried about undermining

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.580 
lathe I was worried about undermining
the<00:00:08.790> capabilities<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.840> let<00:00:10.110> me<00:00:10.139> produce

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
the capabilities that let me produce

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.160 
the capabilities that let me produce
things<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.190> could<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:11.550> use<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.990> it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
things that I could actually use but it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
things that I could actually use but it
turns<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> jet<00:00:14.160> bd9<00:00:14.809> 20w<00:00:15.809> belt

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
turns out that the jet bd9 20w belt

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260 
turns out that the jet bd9 20w belt
drive<00:00:16.410> lathe<00:00:16.710> has<00:00:17.100> everything<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.820> need<00:00:18.060> in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
drive lathe has everything I need in

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
drive lathe has everything I need in
terms<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.630> capabilities<00:00:19.350> durability<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
terms of capabilities durability and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.570 
terms of capabilities durability and
accuracy<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.800> comes<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.160> equipment

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
accuracy and when it comes to equipment

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.980 
accuracy and when it comes to equipment
like<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.359> something<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:24.840> going

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
like this I want something that's going

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
like this I want something that's going
to<00:00:25.080> last<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.529> long<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> jet<00:00:26.730> sure

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
to last a long time and the jet sure

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.169 
to last a long time and the jet sure
seems<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.570> fit<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> bill

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
seems to fit that bill

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.370 
seems to fit that bill
the<00:00:30.179> first<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.720> noticed<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the first thing I noticed was the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
the first thing I noticed was the
hardened<00:00:31.769> steel<00:00:31.830> ways<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.759> keep<00:00:32.940> everything

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
hardened steel ways that keep everything

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.160 
hardened steel ways that keep everything
moving<00:00:33.510> straight<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> true<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.570> also<00:00:36.570> liked<00:00:36.989> at

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
moving straight and true I also liked at

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
moving straight and true I also liked at
all<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> controls<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.070> need<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.820> front

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
all the controls I need a right up front

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
all the controls I need a right up front
and<00:00:39.270> easy<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.790> still<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> learn

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and easy to get to I still have to learn

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
and easy to get to I still have to learn
to<00:00:42.450> use<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.809> correctly<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> layout

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
to use them correctly but the layout

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.150 
to use them correctly but the layout
makes<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.550> easier<00:00:45.950> despite<00:00:46.950> its

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
makes that easier despite its

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
makes that easier despite its
space-saving<00:00:47.730> footprint<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> jet<00:00:48.809> biddy

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
space-saving footprint that jet biddy

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
space-saving footprint that jet biddy

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
important part of any lathe but gives

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
important part of any lathe but gives
this<00:01:12.000> machine<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.260> accuracy

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
this machine a little bit more accuracy

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
little frightening but as I said earlier

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
little frightening but as I said earlier
we're<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> separate<00:01:50.460> video<00:01:50.790> on

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to take each time and do it accurately

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.210 
to take each time and do it accurately
and<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.780> way<00:03:03.900> they<00:03:04.049> have<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.410> set<00:03:04.739> up<00:03:04.950> is

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and the way they have this set up is

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.699 
and the way they have this set up is
that<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.670> set<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.239> take<00:03:06.450> off<00:03:06.709> 5000

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that if you set this to take off 5000

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
that if you set this to take off 5000
it'll<00:03:08.040> actually<00:03:08.220> take<00:03:08.609> 10<00:03:08.910> thousandths<00:03:09.540> off

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it'll actually take 10 thousandths off

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.140 
it'll actually take 10 thousandths off
of<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> piece<00:03:10.170> because<00:03:10.410> you're<00:03:10.769> taking<00:03:11.160> 5000

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
of the piece because you're taking 5000

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.349 
of the piece because you're taking 5000
off<00:03:12.329> all<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> way<00:03:12.930> around<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:14.000> think<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.329> a

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
off all the way around I think this is a

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.300 
off all the way around I think this is a
much<00:03:15.629> easier<00:03:15.900> arrangement<00:03:16.829> for<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> sneak

much easier arrangement for you to sneak

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.289 
much easier arrangement for you to sneak

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
up on the exact size that you want the

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.970 
up on the exact size that you want the
