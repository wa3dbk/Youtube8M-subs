00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
remove it but I found that if you put

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.270 
remove it but I found that if you put
this<00:02:23.190> first<00:02:23.550> let<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.630> sit<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.740> overnight

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
this first let it sit for like overnight

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.140 
this first let it sit for like overnight
then<00:02:27.240> push<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.290> back<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.770> morning<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.220> use

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
then push it back in the morning and use

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.110 
then push it back in the morning and use
the<00:02:30.270> cuticle<00:02:30.660> remover<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.560> actually

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the cuticle remover on it it actually

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
the cuticle remover on it it actually
works<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.330> lot<00:02:33.510> better<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.110> putting<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
works a lot better than putting this and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
works a lot better than putting this and
then<00:02:35.040> removing<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.870> cuticle<00:02:36.870> remover<00:02:37.020> because

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
then removing a cuticle remover because

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.430 
then removing a cuticle remover because
this<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.430> would<00:02:39.330> sink<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.990> sink<00:02:40.320> into

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
this actually would sink like sink into

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370 
this actually would sink like sink into
your<00:02:40.710> cuticles<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.670> make<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.780> lot<00:02:43.110> softer

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
your cuticles to make them a lot softer

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.890 
your cuticles to make them a lot softer
