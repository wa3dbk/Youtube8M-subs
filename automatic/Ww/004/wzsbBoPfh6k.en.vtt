 benjamin franklin political scientist and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 American inventor mentioned the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.530
 perseverance and energy conquers 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.559
 everything is to say that to get the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.360
 success you need to be constant positive 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 and get out of our life what we 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 harms in this way we can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
 achieve our goals and achieve 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 successful in our life but what is the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.019
 success according to the success rae means 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 output results happy from a business or 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.970
 good acceptance as they see the role type 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 in which we find ourselves influence a lot 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.560
 in the kind of success we want 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.590
 achieve financial success there is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 amoroso the familiar among others and although 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.890
 we can not always meet the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 objectives, that's not why we should desist 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.220
 that's why today we will talk about how to convert 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.500
 the failures in successes rethink the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.810
 objectives and thinks maybe the way 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 what is following is not the right 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 with this we will arrive at the questions to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 where do I go and what do I want 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 get must stop seeing 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 falls as permanent failures 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.120
 remember that life is full of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.610
 experiences for it better be 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.650
 rebuild for what you learned keep the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 encouragement in the best of the states not 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.940
 let your attitude and your essence 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.250
 change as I said before all 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.960
 we make mistakes and it's up to you to follow 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 life with a smile or stay 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.550
 frustrated do not fall into despair 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.620
 and discouragement many times when 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.410
 things do not happen as we want 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.110
 we believe in an inconsiderate attitude and 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.560
 selfish and this instead of leaving them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.020
 move forward we are eliminating the shoulds 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.090
 stop doing things by obligation and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.400
 other things because you want to do them and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.520
 Really, things are pleasant 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 imposed never come out in the best way 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.200
 objective approaches and ways to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.340

 work and problems can we 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.180
 generate a lot of stress that's why it's very 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 important that every day you give yourself a time

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.880
 way with these activities the study 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.970
 will decrease last and very important 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.580
 all unnecessary and organize yourself many 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.950
 Sometimes at home or at work you accumulate 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.810
 more items that are not necessary and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.450
 this nothing else causes us much stress 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.490
 give yourself the time to accommodate and throw away 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.200
