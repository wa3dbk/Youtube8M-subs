00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 Masu Tei

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.620
 Unpleasant 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.620
 th 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.320
 Hmm 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.760

 Quite catch if N Djoko Mr. Gooding 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.390
 Well then would there 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.330
 of 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.940
 Is 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:47.650
 It's a big success chart 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.650
 I just have a code attached 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 Hmm 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.210
 m 8 black chrome 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 Well there is something to do but I think it's not so dirty 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.810
 Ok 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.689
 But another bar Kiperi has considerably gone 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.080
 1 second 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.140
 I will go to the usual 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.880
 It is practice 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:08.950
 Problem Well try to take always has I normally take to just below 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:14.190
 It has a protective seal on this history but there is a gast 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.190
 After all there is a peculiar thread 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.670
 It is a fine state, but I think it is a level that will not bother you if you put on a protective seal 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.160
 I will 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.160
 The binder looks beautiful 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.730
 Even different diameter 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.730
 Also clearly visible It is a beautiful double image 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.190
 There is a feeling of use that is fine thread but it is terrible 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.190
 There are no scratches or dents 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.830
 Back pain in the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.830
 It does not seem to be before 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.380
 Is reflected 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.380
 It was usable without any problem to use 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:26.409
 I think it is enough for practical use 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.409
 Well, I feel that there is little thread I'm not beautiful I think that is not well bad 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.740
 I think that it is a fairly convenient camera when you try to use m 8 digital
