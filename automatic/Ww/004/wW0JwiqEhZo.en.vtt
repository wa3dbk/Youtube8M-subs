 the damage carry attack or has to be 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.759
 commonly known is the character that 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.980

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.710
 all the characters of your team in a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.690
 departure or at least that in theory is the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.850
 that the character that attacks from a distance and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 uses physical power as the main 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.170
 source of damage usually you 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.600
 filis in almost all the games at 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.180
 that you enter compound mode and then 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 it kills 12,400 eight times 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.969
 corresponding to any typical 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.969
 smile game you end something like this 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.329
 so to avoid some surprise in 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.250
 your games is mike eras I invite you to 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.250
 learn more about this son 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.860
 first of all not all the characters 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.990
 they serve as a carry and maybe 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.150
 find one if you're new you find 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.060
 a bit difficult but for you to know 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.400
 he is night the sometimes are under the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.390
 category of hunters in the filter 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.390
 character selection 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.890
 there are currently seven gods in this 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.650
 category of which you can choose 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.630
 to form your ads each with their 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.120
 individual skills and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.080
 characterizing itself in a general way in its 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.080
 long-range attack 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.920
 although the ads have a damage 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.650
 considerably larger as you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 the game advances its resistance both 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.970
 physical as well as magical is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.040
 considerably low and in a fight 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.200
 direct melee do not have 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.500
 no chance of leaving 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.290
 victorious so if so they should 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.510
 take advantage of your attack away 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.220
 staying behind your peers 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.810
 infringing the maximum possible damage in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.810
 an eventual no fight 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 the elk are a type of character that 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.500
 they rely a lot on their basic attacks or 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.390
 auto attacks although they have other 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 skills that inflict that equally 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.190
 damage these are not very varied so 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.070
 that its main weapon are attacks 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.260
 basic with these generate the greatest damage 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.840
 giving critical hits that can 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.880
 easily kill an opponent in five 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.750
 attacks or if you're as bad as me 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.390
 maybe in less 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.610
 another general feature of ads 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.580
 in smile is that everyone has some 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.490
 cc skill that paralyzes stuns or 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.850
 slow down your enemies whether it's a 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.010
 simplest skill or the last one giving you 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.220
 a considerable advantage over their 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.020
 opponents when it comes to fighting 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.880
 allowing them to escape easily or 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.650
 stopping the passage of an enemy that 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.650
 escape with very little life 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.490
 the ads as they base their damages on the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.040
 basic attacks are made 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.310
 essential to carry a bio offensive 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.460
 very offensive so in a general way 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.860
 critical damage and physical penetration 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.680
 they are very important if we want to harass 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.100
 to our enemy and kill him before he 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.090
 he kills us also a little 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.980
 a lot of life theft never comes bad 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.290
 since the adc is a character very 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.270
 weak in defense and regenerating life 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.550
 with the damage that the enemy generates 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.890
 it is very useful for this type of 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.190
 character to avoid the constant 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.820
 recall based on maps as large as 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.820
 the compost 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.790
 by placing us on the map the ads move 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.190
 by the line called duo that can 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.889
 be right or left depending on the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.049
 side of the map where you always appear 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.660
 preferably accompanied by some 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.479
 tank or football that can help you 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.150
 stay alive due to its low 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.940
 defense as we said earlier was 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.540
 of you can die very easily in the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.540
 first levels 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.389
 I hope that this mini guide has been 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.250
 useful in some way and before 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.530

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.610
