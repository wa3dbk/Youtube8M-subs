series<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.689> lessons<00:00:30.900> we're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.560> build

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
series of lessons we're going to build

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.060 
series of lessons we're going to build
on<00:00:32.120> top<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.600> Maya<00:00:33.989> basics<00:00:34.530> training<00:00:34.890> kit

on top of the Maya basics training kit

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
on top of the Maya basics training kit
so<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.850> won't<00:00:36.030> spend<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:36.750> on

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
so we won't spend a lot of time on

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.170 
so we won't spend a lot of time on
simple<00:00:37.530> things<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.040> instead<00:00:38.370> techniques<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
simple things but instead techniques to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
simple things but instead techniques to
reach<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> final<00:00:39.870> project<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.460> example

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
reach the final project for example

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.639 
reach the final project for example
we're<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> spend<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> time

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
we're not going to spend a lot of time

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.930 
we're not going to spend a lot of time
actually<00:00:43.649> no<00:00:43.829> time<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.280> setting<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
every kit that we've produced so we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
every kit that we've produced so we
figured<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.649> why<00:00:52.860> waste<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.550> time<00:00:53.820> on

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
figured you know why waste your time on

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.430 
figured you know why waste your time on
something<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.690> when<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.199> right

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
something like that when we get right

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
something like that when we get right
into<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.010> meat<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.489> potatoes<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
into the meat and potatoes of this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
into the meat and potatoes of this
project<00:00:58.250> why<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.430> take<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> minute<00:00:59.910> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
project why don't we take a minute to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
project why don't we take a minute to
first<00:01:00.239> take<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> look<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.870> some<00:01:01.050> high<00:01:01.289> res

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
first take a look at some high res

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
first take a look at some high res
images<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> car<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.699> analyze<00:01:03.690> different

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
images of the car and analyze different

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
images of the car and analyze different
parts<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> car<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
parts of the car that we're going to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
parts of the car that we're going to
have<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> build<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
have to build and some of the some of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.000 
have to build and some of the some of
the<00:01:07.320> things<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the things are going to be more

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
the things are going to be more
difficult<00:01:08.310> than<00:01:08.580> others<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> open<00:01:12.540> up

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
difficult than others so if you open up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
difficult than others so if you open up
the<00:01:12.840> reference<00:01:13.439> images<00:01:13.890> folder<00:01:14.180> there's<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the reference images folder there's a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
the reference images folder there's a
whole<00:01:15.450> bunch<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> images<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.560> we've

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
whole bunch of images here that we've

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.830 
whole bunch of images here that we've
taken<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> let<00:01:18.150> me<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.390> open<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:18.780> up

taken for you let me just open these up
and<00:01:19.939> these<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.119> give<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.420> idea<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.780> what

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and these will give you an idea of what

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
and these will give you an idea of what
we're<00:01:22.350> building<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> gas<00:01:23.250> cap<00:01:23.640> side

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we're building this is the gas cap side

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980 
we're building this is the gas cap side
of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> car<00:01:26.180> which<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> car<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
pieces match up and fit it's going to be

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.410 
pieces match up and fit it's going to be
a<00:01:36.390> challenge<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.020> itself<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.240> we're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
a challenge in itself so we're going to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.800 
a challenge in itself so we're going to
have<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.590> prepared<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.450> do<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> lot

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
have to kind of be prepared to do a lot

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
have to kind of be prepared to do a lot
of<00:01:42.840> tweaking<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> lot<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> times<00:01:44.250> we'll<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of tweaking a lot of times we'll put it

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
of tweaking a lot of times we'll put it
put<00:01:45.210> something<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> spot<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
put something in a spot and then it just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
put something in a spot and then it just
looks<00:01:47.070> better<00:01:47.280> once<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> next<00:01:48.240> part

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
looks better once we get the next part

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
looks better once we get the next part
built<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> move<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> adjust<00:01:49.829> some

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
built so we have to move and adjust some

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
built so we have to move and adjust some
parts<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.390> make<00:01:51.420> everything<00:01:51.780> fit<00:01:52.170> smoothly

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
parts to make everything fit smoothly

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399 
parts to make everything fit smoothly
this<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> good<00:01:53.549> example<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:54.090> how

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this is a good example here how

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.709 
this is a good example here how
this<00:01:56.039> pillar<00:01:56.340> matches<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.329> against

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
this pillar matches right up against

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.669 
this pillar matches right up against
this<00:01:58.399> back<00:01:59.399> fender<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.079> keep<00:02:01.439> things

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
this back fender so have to keep things

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.349 
this back fender so have to keep things
like<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.100> mind<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> tweak<00:02:02.819> things<00:02:02.999> as<00:02:03.210> we

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
like that in mind and tweak things as we

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.139 
like that in mind and tweak things as we
go<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:04.409> headlight<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> little

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
go the headlight is going to be a little

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.359 
go the headlight is going to be a little
bit<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> challenge<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bit of a challenge because it has it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.600 
bit of a challenge because it has it
spans<00:02:08.759> three<00:02:09.030> parts<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.560> vehicle<00:02:11.069> bumper

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
spans three parts of the vehicle bumper

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.869 
spans three parts of the vehicle bumper
the<00:02:12.030> hood<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> front<00:02:13.530> fender<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> so

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
the hood and the front fender and so

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.490 
the hood and the front fender and so
building<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.989> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> little

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
building this is going to be a little

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.559 
building this is going to be a little
bit<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.769> challenge<00:02:17.040> plus<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.209> clear

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
bit of a challenge plus this is clear

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.750 
bit of a challenge plus this is clear
and<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.230> little<00:02:19.760> actual

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and then you have the little actual

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.400 
and then you have the little actual
light<00:02:21.239> inside<00:02:23.090> light<00:02:24.090> assembly<00:02:24.599> let<00:02:25.140> me<00:02:25.230> get

recesses<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> turn<00:02:30.269> signal<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.980> very

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
recesses and the turn signal it's very

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.160 
recesses and the turn signal it's very
smelly<00:02:32.519> very<00:02:32.849> smooth<00:02:33.209> here<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> very

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
smelly very smooth here and then a very

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.979 
smelly very smooth here and then a very
sharp<00:02:34.670> bend<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.750> want

sharp bend here and we're going to want

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.360 
sharp bend here and we're going to want
to<00:02:37.049> ensure<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.709> bevels<00:02:38.250> on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to ensure that we have bevels on

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
to ensure that we have bevels on
everything<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:38.970> everything<00:02:39.209> looks<00:02:39.360> clean<00:02:40.110> and

so<00:02:45.840> let<00:02:45.930> me<00:02:46.019> get<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> side<00:02:46.500> view<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.250> can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so let me get a side view now you can

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.460 
so let me get a side view now you can
see<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.780> edge<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.440> goes

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
see here we have this edge that goes

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
see here we have this edge that goes
along<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.160> entire<00:02:50.730> length<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> car<00:02:51.750> this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
along the entire length of the car this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.860 
along the entire length of the car this
is<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.109> very<00:02:52.530> important<00:02:53.190> feature<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.540> car

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
is a very important feature for this car

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
we're modeling we're going to have to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.890 
we're modeling we're going to have to
make<00:02:59.519> sure<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> set<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.690> edges

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
make sure that we have a set of edges

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.180 
make sure that we have a set of edges
that<00:03:01.290> run<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.340> length<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.200> edge

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
that run the length of this edge

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.890 
that run the length of this edge

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
details there's a close-up of the front

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.990 
details there's a close-up of the front
headlight<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.620> can<00:03:50.770> see<00:03:50.950> here<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.220> this

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
headlight and you can see here that this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.730 
headlight and you can see here that this
part<00:03:52.270> right<00:03:52.300> here<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.660> very<00:03:52.900> opaque<00:03:53.290> can't

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
part right here is very opaque can't

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.260 
part right here is very opaque can't
really<00:03:53.920> see<00:03:54.130> through<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.700> then<00:03:55.150> this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
really see through it and then this

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.060 
really see through it and then this
parts<00:03:55.570> crystal<00:03:56.050> clear<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.500> we'll<00:03:56.710> have<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.920> go

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
parts crystal clear so we'll have to go

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.560 
parts crystal clear so we'll have to go
back<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.490> add<00:03:57.670> some<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.510> those<00:03:58.800> textures<00:03:59.800> in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
back and add some of those textures in

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.700 
back and add some of those textures in
there's<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.660> close-up<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> front<00:04:02.470> grille

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
there's a close-up of the front grille

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.870 
there's a close-up of the front grille
so<00:04:03.120> lots<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.330> great<00:04:05.160> opportunities<00:04:06.160> here<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
so lots of great opportunities here to

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.530 
so lots of great opportunities here to
learn<00:04:07.180> about<00:04:07.680> modeling<00:04:08.680> we<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.520> not<00:04:10.239> going<00:04:10.450> to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
learn about modeling we are not going to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.990 
learn about modeling we are not going to
be<00:04:10.660> afraid<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.110> high-resolution<00:04:12.070> geometry

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
be afraid of high-resolution geometry

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.270 
be afraid of high-resolution geometry
our<00:04:13.239> goal<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.720> not<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.140> make<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.320> low<00:04:14.650> res<00:04:14.890> car

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
our goal is not to make a low res car

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.640 
our goal is not to make a low res car
we're<00:04:15.520> making<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.970> very<00:04:16.570> high<00:04:16.840> risk<00:04:17.080> car<00:04:17.500> that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
we're making a very high risk car that

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.080 
we're making a very high risk car that
we're<00:04:17.739> going<00:04:17.830> to<00:04:17.890> use<00:04:18.040> mental<00:04:18.430> ray<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.640> render

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
we're going to use mental ray to render

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.760 
we're going to use mental ray to render
so<00:04:19.630> we're<00:04:20.049> going<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.230> use<00:04:20.440> lots<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.040> lots<00:04:21.220> of

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
so we're going to use lots and lots of

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.440 
so we're going to use lots and lots of
patches<00:04:23.770> are<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.340> patches<00:04:24.669> polygons<00:04:25.180> and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
patches are not patches polygons and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.330 
patches are not patches polygons and
we're<00:04:26.230> going<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.380> end<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.620> with<00:04:26.860> very<00:04:26.890> high

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
we're going to end up with very high

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.710 
we're going to end up with very high
poly<00:04:27.610> count<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.150> we're<00:04:28.419> going<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.600> end<00:04:28.690> up

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
poly count but we're going to end up

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.930 
poly count but we're going to end up
with<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.900> very<00:04:28.930> nice<00:04:29.530> looking<00:04:29.800> car<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.490> that's

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
with a very nice looking car so that's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.090 
with a very nice looking car so that's
going<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.120> be<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.419> trade-off<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.950> we

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
going to be the trade-off and because we

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.740 
going to be the trade-off and because we
want<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> render<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:33.700> mental<00:04:34.000> ray<00:04:34.150> we're<00:04:34.660> going

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
want to render in mental ray we're going

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.800 
want to render in mental ray we're going
to<00:04:34.840> have<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.200> use<00:04:35.980> polygons<00:04:36.630> although<00:04:37.630> we'll

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
to have to use polygons although we'll

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.750 
to have to use polygons although we'll
use<00:04:37.990> sub-divisional<00:04:38.860> surfaces<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.430> get<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> lot

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
use sub-divisional surfaces to get a lot

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.610 
use sub-divisional surfaces to get a lot
of<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.940> surfaces<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.540> need<00:04:40.690> here's<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.990> great
