00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.980
 we find ourselves with a square face let's see what are the weapons that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.589
 we have to be able to get more out of it 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.829
 let's apply the foundation 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.329
 We apply a make-up base of skin color - aerial 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.699
 malt 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 but now to stay 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 will win 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.400
 let's apply the concealer 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.570
 and dark circles 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.820
 a minimal amount because it is not mine practically Latin 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's apply a shadow 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 around the eyelid 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990
 it's been a month 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.740
 2 especially in each type of face comes in an acceptable way 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.300
 in your case we have said that it has the shape of the face a little square what 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.700
 we are very favored are the boxes 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 some ace to break a bit the whole symmetry 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.230
 with which we have 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.230
 and what clubs in the high zone 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 that was in the center of the eyebrow 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 Use more square grinding way to apply cutouts will be all vertical 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 possible vale 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300
 of face 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.330
 fundamentally we have horizontal lines we have to try to give it 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.070
 verticality 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.650
 it is not necessary to study is coherent up to one hundred 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.830
 not in the case of the face we will not let go of the center 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.580
 pretty lines 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.050
 Straight word to shape it in the central area of ​​the cheekbone 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.939
 in the form of an inverted triangle as loan 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.929
 let's put a simple lip gloss 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.929
 after months of large format 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.769
 but we come to the end of your makeup and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.909
 at the crux of the matter 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.909
 As we said on your face, it still presents the area 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.129
 from the computer 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.209
 presents an area that is a little bit more 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.589
 the bulky that is the area of ​​the jaw 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:52.749
 we are going to put bronzing powder that does not have any shine 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.959
 minimally disguise 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.129
 all this area we will allocate 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.849
 makes the chin 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.099
 state can not be very dark because if there would not be much difference between 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 your skin tone of the neck and the color that we are putting 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.369
 and other names of Africans of the day in case it was not going to be 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.189
 simple would be 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.189
 in this whole area so you also have more square 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.259
 the hairline out 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.019
 to finish with your face 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.029
 it would generally be that I had a longer asymmetric haircut 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.629
 and a completely unstructured bangs we will see a way 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.989
 rounded
