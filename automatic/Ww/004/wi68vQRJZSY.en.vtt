00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.470 
headphones unfortunately but it did come
with<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.959> USB<00:02:33.959> cable<00:02:34.849> still<00:02:35.849> wrapped<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.390> this

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
with a USB cable still wrapped in this

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
with a USB cable still wrapped in this
little<00:02:36.750> plastic<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.409> this<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.739> obviously<00:02:38.220> not

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
little plastic and this is obviously not

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.830 
little plastic and this is obviously not
the<00:02:38.519> one<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.000> came<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:39.209> because<00:02:39.629> this<00:02:39.690> is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the one that came with because this is

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
the one that came with because this is
the<00:02:39.959> newer<00:02:40.230> version<00:02:40.709> cable<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.819> guess

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the newer version cable so I guess

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.430 
the newer version cable so I guess
somebody<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.510> had<00:02:42.659> this<00:02:42.810> laying<00:02:43.049> around<00:02:43.200> and
