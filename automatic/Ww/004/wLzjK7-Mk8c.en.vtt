00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
about 7 billion on the planet that's one

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.610 
about 7 billion on the planet that's one
out<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.610> every<00:00:58.820> seven<00:00:59.479> people<00:00:59.899> on<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.320> planet

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
out of every seven people on this planet

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.610 
out of every seven people on this planet
who<00:01:01.129> are<00:01:01.820> overweight<00:01:02.149> it's<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:02.899> large<00:01:03.230> number

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
who are overweight it's a large number

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.779 
who are overweight it's a large number
especially<00:01:03.769> if<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.129> consider<00:01:04.250> there<00:01:04.699> are

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
especially if you consider there are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.560 
especially if you consider there are
many<00:01:05.089> many<00:01:05.899> people<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.800> poverty<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.580> starving

many many people in poverty and starving

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.650 
many many people in poverty and starving

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
so that's a high number guys 1 billion

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.650 
so that's a high number guys 1 billion
overweight<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:13.160> third<00:01:13.820> is<00:01:14.200> obese<00:01:15.200> or<00:01:15.740> obese

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
are two ways to do that number one is

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.940 
are two ways to do that number one is
you<00:01:54.289> move<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:55.399> have<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.700> move<00:01:56.090> your<00:01:56.300> body<00:01:56.539> and

will be of going over that later in the
week<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.110> exercises<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.520> we're<00:02:01.879> speaking

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
week the exercises but we're speaking

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.150

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
to make sure you're not overeating

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.339 
to make sure you're not overeating
portion<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.509> amount<00:02:08.750> you're<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
portion is the amount you're so of

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.520 
portion is the amount you're so of
yourself<00:02:10.480> you<00:02:11.480> could<00:02:11.629> serve<00:02:11.930> yourself<00:02:12.319> this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
yourself you could serve yourself this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.960 
yourself you could serve yourself this
much<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:12.920> could<00:02:13.040> serve<00:02:13.220> yourself<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:13.730> much
