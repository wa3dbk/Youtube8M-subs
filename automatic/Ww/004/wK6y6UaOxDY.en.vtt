so<00:00:25.560> let's<00:00:25.769> take<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> closer<00:00:26.189> look<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so let's take a closer look at what the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.810 
so let's take a closer look at what the
g5<00:00:27.060> has<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> offer<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> g5<00:00:29.279> has<00:00:29.340> four

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
g5 has to offer so the g5 has four

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.339 
g5 has to offer so the g5 has four

LCD screens and their own amount of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
LCD screens and their own amount of
settings<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.380> allows<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
settings this allows you to use up to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
settings this allows you to use up to

simultaneously at the same time so the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
simultaneously at the same time so the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
g5 also has a two booster which allows

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
g5 also has a two booster which allows
people<00:00:45.210> who<00:00:45.360> play<00:00:45.570> solos<00:00:45.960> live<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.440> me<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
people who play solos live like me to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760 
people who play solos live like me to
add<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> 10<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> 16<00:00:48.149> DB<00:00:48.480> boost<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.379> solo

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
add up to 10 to 16 DB boost on your solo

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.080 
add up to 10 to 16 DB boost on your solo
which<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> great<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.610> me<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:51.059> I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
which is great for me because when I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
which is great for me because when I
solo<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.480> always<00:00:51.840> turn<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.440> extra

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
solo I always turn on like an extra

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
solo I always turn on like an extra
boost<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> -<00:00:54.059> screamer<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.480> something

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
boost like a - screamer or something

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
boost like a - screamer or something
like<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.350> another<00:00:55.739> overdrive

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
like that or just another overdrive

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
like that or just another overdrive
pedal<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> make<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> boost<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.750> has<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
pedal to make the boost so this has a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.299 
pedal to make the boost so this has a
tube<00:00:58.199> driver<00:00:58.350> which<00:00:58.590> gives<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> very

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
tube driver which gives you that very

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.819 
tube driver which gives you that very
cleanly<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.600> g5<00:01:00.989> expression<00:01:01.500> pedal<00:01:01.710> has

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
cleanly the g5 expression pedal has

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
cleanly the g5 expression pedal has
traditional<00:01:02.309> movements<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.730> far<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
traditional movements as far as up and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
traditional movements as far as up and
down<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.379> cool<00:01:04.619> left

also has a really cool setting which is
a<00:01:28.590> built-in<00:01:28.890> drum<00:01:29.250> machine<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.670> gives<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
a built-in drum machine which gives you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
a built-in drum machine which gives you
over<00:01:30.180> 40<00:01:30.659> drum<00:01:31.020> patterns<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> get

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
over 40 drum patterns so when you get

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
over 40 drum patterns so when you get
sick<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.400> drummer<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.360> want

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
to use him anymore you can use the g5

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.929 
to use him anymore you can use the g5
another<00:01:37.650> cool<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
can totally see it from the stage and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.550 
can totally see it from the stage and
whether<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> club<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.020> arena<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.409> a

stadium or just in your house lastly I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
stadium or just in your house lastly I
was<00:01:50.280> programming<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.479> got<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
was programming this thing I got it and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
was programming this thing I got it and
I<00:01:53.009> actually<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.850> four<00:01:54.149> days<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.630> program

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I actually had like four days to program

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
I actually had like four days to program
this<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> didn't<00:01:56.219> feel<00:01:56.430> rushed

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
this thing and it I didn't feel rushed

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.109 
this thing and it I didn't feel rushed
at<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.390> honestly<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> got<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
at all honestly when I got it and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.980 
at all honestly when I got it and
processing<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> I've<00:02:00.540> always<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
processing like this I've always kind of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
processing like this I've always kind of
scared<00:02:01.290> me<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.560> far<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.299> multi<00:02:03.299> effects

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
scared me as far as multi effects

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
scared me as far as multi effects
processors<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
processors go and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.120 
processors go and
amp<00:02:05.220> simulating<00:02:06.410> isn't<00:02:07.410> always<00:02:07.560> necessarily

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
amp simulating isn't always necessarily

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.450 
amp simulating isn't always necessarily
OnPoint<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.600> amp<00:02:09.720> sounds<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.920> am

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
OnPoint to what the amp sounds like I am

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.520 
OnPoint to what the amp sounds like I am
actually<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.850> huge<00:02:12.270> gear<00:02:12.930> collector<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.410> have

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually a huge gear collector and have

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760 
actually a huge gear collector and have
a<00:02:13.560> ton<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.890> amps<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> closest<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.530> me

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
a ton of amps this is the closest to me

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.420 
a ton of amps this is the closest to me
personally<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.760> I've<00:02:18.710> had<00:02:19.710> as<00:02:19.980> far<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.190> amp

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
personally that I've had as far as amp

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
personally that I've had as far as amp
modeling<00:02:20.880> goes<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.080> was

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
modeling goes like when I was when I was

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.260 
modeling goes like when I was when I was
programming<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:23.400> main<00:02:23.700> feature<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.240> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
programming it my main feature as a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.760 
programming it my main feature as a
diesel<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.780> use<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> diesel<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:25.620> much

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
diesel I use a diesel and pretty much

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.860 
diesel I use a diesel and pretty much
anything<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.490> shine<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.210> that's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
anything that is shine down and that's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.810 
anything that is shine down and that's
that<00:02:28.350> got<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.710> tone<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> exact<00:02:29.400> same<00:02:29.580> tone<00:02:29.760> I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
that got that tone the exact same tone I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.400 
that got that tone the exact same tone I
used<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.210> song<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.510> sound<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.810> madness<00:02:31.200> or

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
used on song so I sound a madness or

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.860 
used on song so I sound a madness or
devour<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.190> put<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.660> put<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
devour and put it in and put the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.180 
devour and put it in and put the
headphones<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.380> didn't<00:02:34.680> even<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:34.950> use

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
headphones on I didn't even really use

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.710 
headphones on I didn't even really use
an<00:02:35.310> app<00:02:35.460> there's<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> couple<00:02:36.210> times<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.660> I

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
an app there's a couple times when I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.910 
an app there's a couple times when I
would<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:36.900> cleans<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.320> I'd<00:02:37.440> use<00:02:37.560> an<00:02:37.650> amp<00:02:37.800> but

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
would do cleans that I'd use an amp but

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
would do cleans that I'd use an amp but
when<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.280> headphones<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.120> sounded

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
when I put the headphones in it sounded

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.449 
when I put the headphones in it sounded
exactly<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.260> tone<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.340> also

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
exactly like my tone and it was also

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.230 
exactly like my tone and it was also
easy<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> program<00:02:42.300> which<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.870> me<00:02:43.020> was<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:44.610> plus

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
easy to program which for me was a plus

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.030 
easy to program which for me was a plus
because<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.959> comes<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> things<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
because it comes to things like this I

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.560 
because it comes to things like this I
see<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.490> knobs<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.300> save

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
see all these knobs and you have to save

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.449 
see all these knobs and you have to save
and<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.050> scroll<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.220> stuff

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and you have to scroll and that stuff

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.890 
and you have to scroll and that stuff
kind<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.670> gets<00:02:50.820> hard<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.180> me<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.540> going

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
kind of gets hard for me and then going

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
kind of gets hard for me and then going
choosing<00:02:52.320> through<00:02:52.500> stop<00:02:52.740> boxes<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.550> thing

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
choosing through stop boxes is one thing

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
choosing through stop boxes is one thing
but<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.360> was<00:02:54.480> very<00:02:54.660> easy<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.990> program<00:02:55.380> for<00:02:55.500> me

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
but it was very easy to program for me

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.260 
but it was very easy to program for me
like<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.040> said<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> had<00:02:56.310> four<00:02:56.610> days<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> program

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
like I said I had four days to program

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.510 
like I said I had four days to program
40<00:02:57.780> different<00:02:57.900> patch<00:02:58.230> settings<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> was

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
40 different patch settings and it was

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.070 
40 different patch settings and it was
super<00:02:59.910> easy<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.209> kind<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.450> flowed<00:03:00.690> through<00:03:00.900> like

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
super easy I kind of flowed through like

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.960 
super easy I kind of flowed through like
20<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> day<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> last<00:03:02.520> few<00:03:02.640> days<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.940> just

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
20 a day and in the last few days I just

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.460 
20 a day and in the last few days I just
got<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.300> kind<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.570> play<00:03:03.720> around<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.260> make

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
got to kind of play around with it make

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
got to kind of play around with it make
sure<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> wanted<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.850> sounds

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
sure that what I wanted and the sounds

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.210 
sure that what I wanted and the sounds
that<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.300> wanted<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.350> was<00:03:07.470> super<00:03:07.770> easy<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that I wanted so it was super easy to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.920 
that I wanted so it was super easy to
program<00:03:08.550> for<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.209> hopefully<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.900> the
