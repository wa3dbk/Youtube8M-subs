00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.240 
I think this with Timothy Olyphant
character<00:01:57.200> was<00:01:57.350> great<00:01:57.650> because<00:01:57.800> he<00:01:57.890> was<00:01:58.070> so

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
character was great because he was so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.730 
character was great because he was so
dark<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:59.180> loved<00:01:59.450> our<00:01:59.630> scenes<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.200> he's<00:02:00.560> you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
dark and I loved our scenes and he's you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.600 
dark and I loved our scenes and he's you
know<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.890> don't<00:02:01.040> know<00:02:01.160> whether<00:02:01.310> he's<00:02:01.430> good<00:02:01.580> or

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
know you don't know whether he's good or

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.850 
know you don't know whether he's good or
bad<00:02:01.790> for<00:02:02.060> Ellen<00:02:02.330> which<00:02:02.510> was<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:02.780> think

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
bad for Ellen which was I think

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.890 
bad for Ellen which was I think
compelling<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.980> watch<00:02:04.010> but<00:02:04.460> um<00:02:04.640> again<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.840> I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
compelling to watch but um again and I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.870 
compelling to watch but um again and I
think<00:02:06.140> she's<00:02:06.290> nearly<00:02:06.830> kind<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.280> healed<00:02:07.580> from

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
think she's nearly kind of healed from

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.880 
think she's nearly kind of healed from
the<00:02:08.090> murder<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.600> her<00:02:08.899> fiance<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.680> all<00:02:09.770> that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
the murder of her fiance and all that

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.530 
the murder of her fiance and all that
sort<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.100> stuff<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.550> that's<00:02:10.760> great<00:02:11.120> territory

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
sort of stuff so that's great territory

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.600 
sort of stuff so that's great territory
