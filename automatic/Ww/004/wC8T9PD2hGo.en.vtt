00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.840
 hello it's fast here for rather 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.780
 point info i will show you 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.889
 today how to take back 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.260
 apple trees in your area 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.710
 so here I took the little apples 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.430
 wild and make small trees to 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.020
 plant in your garden or then 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 everywhere around you for 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.020
 incredible edible for example or 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.290
 town anyway your plants and more 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.030
 in addition to tree varieties like the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.890
 suicides that titillates and all of us 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 bring food without anything 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.220
 do then 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.000
 I went 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.120
 during a walk harvested 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.530
 small wild apples so of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.330
 all kinds I took several kinds 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 different and then I'm going to recover 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:00.320
 the seeds in his apples with a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.119
 knife here I have a client on hand 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 a little risky the couple performed 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.550
 here and then I will recover all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 the glitches we'll do this for 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.280
 moments 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:32.789
 and then then after I show you 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:34.740
 how do I put them in hockey so here 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.600
 I collected some glitches I have 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 enough just for now I still 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 from work I still 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.370
 the little bit not one then takes all that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 it will give little apple trees 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.740
 wild it is certain we can be 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.850
 a little bit everywhere but if you want 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.900
 good apples 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.870
 we can simply graft to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.490
 the first bau strikes on the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.790
 plants that have grown in a few 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 years 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.850
 So now we are going to prepare the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.800
 potting soil so I'm going to put sand 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.780
 beyond the earth and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 we'll do a little game mix but 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.090
 a little bit of sand it's just for 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.800
 that's a little more reason than this 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.800
 that the seeds do not rot 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.100
 Once again, it's a good mix 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.360
 I filled the pockets 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.569
 and I prepare them in series so it made me 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.569
 enjoyed 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.500
 it attracts the opinion issued by all 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.290
 because you have to do it really 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.290
 well spent 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.080
 sagem so here you know it takes 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.350
 to say that we can also of course 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.050
 plum skis to keep them 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.430
 they leave them in louis and if 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.260
 you must keep them all winter 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.830
 so you leave them in a bag of 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.960
 very slightly wet sand and then 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.650
 they will be ready to sprout if you 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.440
 keep in the fridge 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.240
 they will be ready to sprout in the spring 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.940
 so this is the distance the nuclei the 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.190
 glitches you can leave pink at 10am and 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.640
 of rooms slightly damp at the bottom of the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.690
 crisper in the fridge is like that 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:19.000
 in the spring you have everything he 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:19.000
 must for pediatric summit 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460
 it 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.390
 that's the risk here we can take a 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.750
 small watering can with a little pot words 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.750
 like that it's like a little rain 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.350
 still a little post from the special fund 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.810
 from the medard fund to the seagrass beds 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.810
 that's impeccable
