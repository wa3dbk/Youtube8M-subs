diagonally<00:01:33.829> in<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.960> angle<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:37.130> would

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
diagonally in a angle so that it would

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.349 
diagonally in a angle so that it would
be<00:01:37.609> easier<00:01:37.969> to<00:01:38.299> pass<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.109> ribbon<00:01:39.530> through<00:01:39.799> the

skulls even though they have a big area

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.969 
skulls even though they have a big area
to<00:01:45.469> feed<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.189> ribbon<00:01:46.549> through<00:01:47.409> then<00:01:48.409> pass<00:01:48.740> the
