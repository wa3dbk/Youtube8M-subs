00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.590
 something else out and then came a drop 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.780
 out now I have shower gel on mine 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 bare legs in which yes they are off it 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 it's too hot that right 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.980
 outrageous at all somehow in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.369
 to turn this weather video when you can 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.170
 the Switzerland must indeed attract them but 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 I'm still you got me in one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
 serve purposes as it is now real 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 interesting in any case what should be there 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 as already said one is used up 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.579
 video 24 a few things again 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 first of all, that's what accumulated 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.489
 clearly lubricated on my legs is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 from the body shop the pink grapefruit 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.870
 shower gel and I found that extremely before 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 well you really liked liked I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 Believe me once or twice a year 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 that's how long it took 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 So very very productive but I have to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.579
 Just do not tell me that right now 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.360
 more I do not like really only 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.489
 soapy with artificial aroma like and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
 That's why I'm not so pleased 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.820
 so some things are empty 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.559
 have been around for a long time 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.420
 time I have given trouble now 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 to continue to use and nothing new 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 then come on frieda the fries is yes 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 with silicone and so on 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
 I did not even pay attention 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
 Now I'm looking for you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 daily wonder chur I have to say 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.920
 is also with protection 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 I think I have now 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.119
 one and a half years or so and that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.920
 lasts really long and i think 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.610
 she makes the hair logically silicones 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.830
 if I am wrong 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.340
 Guarantor I'll watch yes 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.900
 Of course, yes I think that the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.550
 making hair supple they look very 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.960
 Nice and so but must be aware 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.850
 that's just because of this 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 coat and the hair around it is when 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.020
 one stands on such a thing then it is 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.450
 quite okay then you have 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.150
 last presented by la volta the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.170
 skier body cream the like you know me 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.000
 likes the smell too much 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.000
 I do not think that's what happens 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.200
 yes fresh somehow and I found that 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.850
 I have always taken very pleasant 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 cream my legs after that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.830
 shave epilate what but mostly straight 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.380
 and so on 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.250
 But you are interested in them now 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.759
 I think that makes the skin easy 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.619
 very far and I really like it 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.930
 then next empty of new 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.759
 london in july london , I have you too 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.410
 already different face care things 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.800
 and as this is now the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.110
 organic farming facemash already 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.239
 face already of the face 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.560
 cleanser with rose and yes the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.450
 Ingredients are really good it is 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.200
 a company worth supporting it is even 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.970
 not so expensive 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.070
 it lies and feels 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.450
 little soapy to or actually very 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.860
 often as a bit of this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.720
 feature feeling that's why more than 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 Eleven not so much but I have to say 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.340
 now that it's all somehow gone and gone 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.720
 is quasi somehow missing me accordingly 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.489
 I felt that was actually 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.000
 my face is quite good and i have 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.170
 it really likes to be used 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.960
 online I try everything as always 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.560
 to link 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.330
 think there were coffins of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.530
 I always have ritchies on my one 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.500
 travel bag I'm often too 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.910
 while body scrub is that 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.440
 I love the feeling is exactly 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.540
 really also ingrown hair 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.470
 Prevent and just get the skin right 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.380
 nice to play 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 they were all copies are also 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.650
 to the big pot of but I find the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 just fine to go with them on the go 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.230
 have and it smells very good 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.600
 and do his job 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 then I made two bubbly 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 or once conditioner and 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.990
 a shampoo that I also go with 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.050
 dragged me around and that by 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.620
 amazon amazon beauty beauty is power and 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.750
 Although the series is called rain forest 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.880
 from body and the same yes they are without 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.790
 time of course 100% vegan the whole 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.870
 bubbly and so on I have to look 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.280
 because I 'm not so sure anymore 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.160
 it was like that now with the ingredients 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.200
 But that was what I'm up to now 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.240
 Half looks good anyway 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 as they are so father under but 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.950
 only in the middle and not now 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.510
 So if you want to have a good chance 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.770
 then it was pretty good to me 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.240
 always said if the user as well 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.470
 my hair would and i was too 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.120
 satisfied with the result 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.590
 for the really great if he thinks 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.910
 I'll shampoo myself when I go 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.080
 I have so much to test but I do 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.500
 At some point he will have me 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.300
 I can recommend you to buy then 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.420
 I have the eyes movie of kodÃ¡ly 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.040
 made and indeed the premiere green means 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.450
 she thinks i found it very good 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.430
 I was extremely happy with this 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.200
 eyes and can not really 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.760
 say more about it except that mine 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
 eye has cultivates 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.540
 yes, I was always right before that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.340
 dry eyes and quite dry skin 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.260
 under my eyes and after that after me 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 to regularly use it was 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.900
 actually quite good to not so hot 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.270
 People I do not believe that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.070
 if you 're naked like a continent there 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 I would be even happier, yes 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.290
 but then I'd canal countries 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:49.190
 So the plate then entices you and indeed 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.630
 in primrose of cream of korres and the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.340
 I've been here too since I believe 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.130
 I've got almost two years like that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.380
 My set had my first products 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.970
 before eternity and there is still one 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.650
 mini blob in it but now has 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.570
 also just shared and is anyway 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.790
 almost all of them I found quite good but had 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.540
 I feel like there is something special 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.880
 Ehrenberg then somehow became mine 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.560
 holy gral of essens weather than 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.230
 proxy la france 3 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.000
 I think the hero is easier everyone knows 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.440
 unfortunately it simply dries longer 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.880
 he pretty fast at the end of one is there 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.500
 so viscous that you are new sooner 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.440
 needs as he really buy everything 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.900
 but then become even longer 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.570
 but I'll keep them soon but they 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.670
 Packaging of agennix as pure aloe 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.830
 vera gel had told everything 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.750
 What skin is somehow irritated 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.720
 sunburn and so on and so forth 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.390
 Pure aloe vera I always find good if 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.980
 it not so mix and I will 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.170
 times I find that sell a lot 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.200
 very good and that should be mine now 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.390
 used things now so slow me 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.430
 I'm really good just in it so older 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.650

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.420
 new to the test close and so and so 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.130

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.590

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.310
