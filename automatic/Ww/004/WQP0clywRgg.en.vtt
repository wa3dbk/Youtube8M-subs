00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.100

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.450
 inverse one thing that I fall in love with 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.310
 really very much is that there is music that 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.930
 I like to accompany moments 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.539
 specials of my life is to say I put you 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.270
 a typical situation that the kid that you 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.340
 Like you come over and she's going to give you a kiss and 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.739
 just because he had the ipod on and 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.079
 had a special song or that song 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.630
 it becomes special for the moment that they have 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.380
 come or there I do not know any orchestra of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.870
 background a street musician or you're not 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.700
 in a bar and some song sounds to me 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.770
 That really makes me fall in love 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.420
 I really love having songs 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.000
 related to very special moments 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.739

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.229
 they speak that they really help you and for 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.630
 Of course this makes the environment 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.180
 super nice and you pay a lot 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.830
 more is not that I love spending and spending 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.170

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 when they pamper you I do not know how you pay and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
 you're more satisfied it's like you do not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.090
 it matters so much because you have been treated very 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.670
 Well, I assure you that to me that 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.910
 I love I have a certain love towards heaven 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.490
 so to speak I love the sun of the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.220
 third the dawn when the clouds 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.259
 The silhouettes that are 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.479
 they create when it's backlit with the sun 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.210
 all that kind of lighting stuff 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.790
 from heaven it seems precious to me beautiful 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.710
 beautiful and one thing that makes me fall in love is 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 be watching the sunset and look at the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.130
 cloud and imagine things see things in the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 clouds with light that naranjita not know me 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.180
 it seems something precious fourth thing that I 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.819
 love is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.129
 get up in the morning with a smile 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.349
 and that smile is created thanks to 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.599
 a person thanks to someone leaving 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.000
 to make me happy is to sleep with a 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.209
 smile and get up with a smile 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.239
 true if a person can do that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.920
 you deserve to be in love with that person 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.379
 you know one thing that I love very much 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.819
 When I arrive at my house I open the door and 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.859
 I find my dog who are 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.290
 chihuahua spinning round laps 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.530
 plan laps are here and you are 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.680
 I do not know here I love how I do not feel 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.689
 that my dog wants me other than me 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.060
 They like breakfast a lot 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.010
 bed I think all women if we're 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.650
 sleeping we open our eyes and see that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.079
 that guy that we like there's no noise 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 signed the bed or wave can there be something 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.930
 that we fall in love more at least to me 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.030
 falls in love very much even though there is another 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.590
 thing that I love that are the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.359
 Hotel breakfasts may have 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.849
 something better than a hotel breakfast in 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.980
 plan these are buffet that bring 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.629
 all kinds of things for all kinds of 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.159
 cultures not all but in its great 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.380
 most that you have fried egg or 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.090
 cereal 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.150
 I do not know about everything and it's like oh my god 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.730
 I would eat it all something that I love 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.920
 it's that typical afternoon that's raining 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.490
 better a Sunday that has nothing that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.350
 do and it's the afternoon movie that's laying 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.780
 on the couch with a movie that you like 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.240
 popcorn and some good blankets is 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 the best times if you want it is from 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.840
 the best the truth that I love 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.080
 many types of movies from some 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.430
 more than thinking some romantic I do not know my 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.530
 favorite this has to be said that they are 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.950
 the romantic comedies are beautiful and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.240
 over you laugh something that makes me feel 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.040
 in love are the small details 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.080
 newspapers I think there is no need to do 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.450
 great things every thousand years but that 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.400
 where you really see if a person 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.020
 It's worth it if you love and treat you 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.930
 well they are in the small details 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.840
 daily to be attentive on the other 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.209
 person and me something that makes me fall in love is 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.220
 those little details that I can 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.490
 do throughout the day or along 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.440
 a week I do not know that touch that says ua 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.810
 is that he remembers me I have a lot 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.600
 much much much love towards the snow 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.270
 it's something that makes me happy lately 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.389
 it's been snowing a little bit and when it's been 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.550
 my face is happiness or see the snow 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.380
 fall and it's like oh my god what else 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.730
 really pretty for me the snow is 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.470
 beautiful and you have to see me for the 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.450
 street with my headphones on while 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.750
 it snows and I happy of life giving 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.450
 skip because it's snowing and nothing 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.250
 better than a kiss under the snow or the 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.970
 kiss under the rain would be very typical 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.250
 a kiss under the snow that's too much and 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.500
