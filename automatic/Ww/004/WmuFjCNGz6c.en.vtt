00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
dot how would that and then do a circle

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
dot how would that and then do a circle
that<00:01:04.710> goes<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.489> starts<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.150> dot

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that goes around and starts at that dot

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
that goes around and starts at that dot
it<00:01:06.510> comes<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> dot<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it comes back around to that dot that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.990 
it comes back around to that dot that
cool<00:01:08.780> there<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> go

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000

perfect<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> circle<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> did<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
perfect look at that circle you did a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.600 
perfect look at that circle you did a
good<00:01:13.710> job

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
good job

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280

v-shape<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> go

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
v-shape all right so we're going to go

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
v-shape all right so we're going to go
we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> we're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
we're going to start up here and we're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
we're going to start up here and we're
going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.720> inside<00:01:21.990> his<00:01:22.409> mouth<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.950> inside

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
going to go inside his mouth or inside

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
going to go inside his mouth or inside
the<00:01:23.520> circle<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.750> we're

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the circle a little bit and then we're

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
the circle a little bit and then we're
going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> come<00:01:25.200> outside<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.009> circle<00:01:26.250> -<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
going to come outside the circle - so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.649 
going to come outside the circle - so
we've<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.689> V<00:01:28.280> can<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.640> V<00:01:30.030> so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
we've got a V can you do a little V so

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
we've got a V can you do a little V so
we'll<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.350> points<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.950> point<00:01:32.250> there

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
we'll do I'll do points one point there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
we'll do I'll do points one point there
and<00:01:32.729> another<00:01:33.570> point<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:34.049> you'll<00:01:34.770> do

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and another point there you'll do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
and another point there you'll do
another<00:01:35.159> point<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.960> do<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> connect

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
another point down there do I connect
