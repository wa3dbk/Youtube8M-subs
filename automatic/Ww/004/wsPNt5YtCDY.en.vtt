00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.280
Today we're showing you how to properly assemble
the THR family of Aluminum Threshold Ramps.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.980
The only tool required is a Phillips head
screwdriver.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.740
Depending on which model of the THR ramps
you have, your parts will vary; namely the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.740
number of RAMP EXTENSIONS, SUPPORT FEET and
SELF TAPPING SCREWS.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.020
Start with a RAMP EXTENSION and the shortest
SUPPORT FOOT.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.800
Align the opening on the bottom of the RAMP
EXTENSION with the top of the SUPPORT FOOT.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.700
Slide the SUPPORT FOOT into the opening on
the bottom of the RAMP EXTENSION.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Align both screw holes in the SUPPORT FOOT
with both screw holes in the RAMP EXTENSION.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.810
Use SELF TAPPING SCREWS to secure it in place.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.530
Next take the BOTTOM SECTION and align the
opening with the RAMP EXTENSION.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.790
Slide the RAMP EXTENSION into the opening
on the BOTTOM SECTION.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.350
Secure in place with a SELF TAPPING SCREW.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.270
Repeat the previous steps for all included
RAMP EXTENSIONS and SUPPORT FEET. Make sure

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.270
the SUPPORT FEET are in order from shortest
to tallest.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.080
Lastly, to attach the ADJUSTABLE TOP FLAP,
align the ADJUSTABLE TOP FLAP with the end

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.200
of the highest RAMP EXTENSION. Slide the ADJUSTABLE TOP FLAP through until the screw holes align.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.200
Use a SELF TAPPING SCREW to secure it in place.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.000
The ADJUSTABLE TOP FLAP will still move freely but will not slide out.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.930
