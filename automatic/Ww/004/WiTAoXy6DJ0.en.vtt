 I do not think I have other words 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.150
 for to say in what inheritance knew 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.130

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.210
 series xy primo shock I took you out 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.220
 two illustrations for once I'm going 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.559

 Shock with who grodon so in any case 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.530
 case I hope we can be spoiled in 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.699

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.440
 booster my wars guys to see this 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.969
 are the luckiest of the four 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 booster let's see if this theory is going 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.359
 to be verified today I have us 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.219

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.660

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.640

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.320
 in my p'tits already and we will spend everything 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.930
 immediately after opening the two boosters 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.040
 so let's go we open the first 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.480
 the one of mega the kings strong any case I 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.710
 I'm really happy with yesterday's video 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.860

 it was just too much too much will find 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.390
 if you have not seen it elsewhere I'll 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.520
 advise to go see her she will be 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.230
 finally this video and I hope that the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.930
 pickaxe today could be as 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.420
 famous go we left with the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.750
 cool cards 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.640
 will follow a windy them there little potash 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.990
 miniature modeling clay frankly 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 I look at illustration 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.720
 the impression that it is right on 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 a little stone and that he is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.570
 microscopic even it looks like not even 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.310
 pokemon playdough or would say a 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.360
 figurine I do not know if you're 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.800
 agree with me but I find it 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.440
 huge this illustration 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.320
 we go on with a burst hall 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.580
 back there are 5 1 2 3 and 2 at the bottom we 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.680
 do not see very well but I love 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.950
 the illustration also we continue with 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.570
 marc loos re sister the rough sea it 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.369
 it may mean that who works 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.540
 will come or so he's gone I do not 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.780
 do not know then we have 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.250
 sir mime we continue with a super 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 nice map it's about the flights because at 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 pod golden game this one the super good 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.890
 also the pokemon is anyway I 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 always found that type cards 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.849
 fire have a crazy charm I love cards 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 here you have understood go on we 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.590
 continues or is not bad a black notebook 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.689
 Rivers without very good that my breakfast 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.170
 starts from the start a rare one pours into 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.489
 the first booster that ask for better 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.079
 great then frankly if we have a 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.290
 ultra zone it will be even more huge 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.599
 go go to 1 snowball 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.769
 so much the few here I do a 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.750
 big chain of rare there are rare 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.370
 I like much but it gave bull 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.989
 will stay there I prefer to linger 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.430
 on the 15 dead what I find 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.790
 much more beautiful is much more 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.230
 rich 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.430
 however some of you 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.810
 might like a snowball a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.939
 game was not said in comment 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.139
 personally I'm peeling walrus my 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.720
 little crush of booster 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.439
 ice dip is enough evolutions 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.870
 of carp magic 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.389
 except that he and the parties live in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.709
 north pole go on it goes with the 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.930
 best boosters of the two so-called 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.269
 for the end pray for a good layer 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.650
 in any case, the four 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.510
 first-time shock booster I bought 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.250
 for the breakfast series of these two 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.659
 last weeks for now 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.669
 are three rare on 3 cloves 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.959
 we will see if the fourth could be 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.069
 a little better still I hope because 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.169
 that it's true that lately 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.729
 primo shock it's not quite that at 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.019
 level of draws and yet there sorry 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.290
 I do not have and there are some very 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.389
 pretty 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.310
 it would be nice to have them together then 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.440
 we start with a barrel in common 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.709
 then again the little horde 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.720
 darracq of water that's nice 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.400
 zig zaton commune that I say it all the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.870
 time anyway I know that my 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
 comment that sometimes repeats itself 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.510
 and for those who watch all my 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.489
 sometimes you have the impression 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.659
 I'm hiking but it's because 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.919
 that I also think of the new ones who 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.629
 would watch these videos that we have not seen them 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.220
 old and then that's when I see 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.840
 a map especially that's it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.849
 inspires me on the moment and after I 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.040
 repeat knows but here I apologize 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.109
 in any case I find this exact one super 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.319
 beautiful she is too beautiful illustration 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.180
 go on we continue with an art that we 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.409
 connects with bitter debate in a 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.150
 little forest so maybe the wood 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.430
 remains ion or others I do not know 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.650
 in any case to the ducharme I love the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.889
 landscape we continue with the link 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.000
 Spirited pebble king at the roof that makes 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.700
 long time I had not seen so 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.470
 an art alfa in 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.180
 it's pestering them so frankly go 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.890
 go perfect the map then 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.490
 normally dusty does it attacks 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.900
 sparks 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.250
 but I have the impression there is that 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.050
 it's more meteors that falls from 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
 heaven is huge small meteorites 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.410
 out of his mouth was going to super revel the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.820
 map 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.290
 frankly me it is perhaps the blow 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.800
 of heart to booster I will put it 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.190
 next to 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.050
 then we have an intern in rivers 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.760
 very good draw a mask to a little 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.310
 like a river this is a pleasure 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.650
 very friendly and we finish this little 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.320
 already and this last booster by par by 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.120
 these parts stopover Varennes rabbi 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.590
 strongly after the beach we had 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.540
 yesterday had to be there trolls in this 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.870
 breakfast obviously a slave to reindeer 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.620
 will have a good good good good yeah yeah 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.110
 yeah 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 yes here you have understood his little 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.040
 smile there with his mustaches here he 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.200
 I left the troll pokemon too well 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.570
 it's pokemon anyway my luck 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.860
 is not quite back on 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.270
 will see maybe for later but in 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.470
 anyway what was very pleasant 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.340
 I said I was going to put the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.010
 two best quarters of this opening 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.110
 so for me it was windy they are 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.160
 the case and maurs of the first booster say 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.360
 me if you agree with me 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.010
 maybe you are other cards 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.050
 that you preferred in this little 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.060
 personally lunch a water pokemon 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.620
 and the other a pokemon fire I find that 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.510
 it's really a good breakfast 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.560
 this is you understand me I hope that 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.030
 you have regaled you 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.530
