00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.620
 we support the sugar paste of the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.550
 color we want 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.130
 and then helping the circle level 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.160
 we cut strips of pasta from 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160
 sugar 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.600
 in the video heart the cake make up ho 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.629
 put our so it was instead 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:50.199
 this time I want to show how 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:55.180
 do it without without that tape with a 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:58.210
 coppapasta I have drawn the line that 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.799
 so it will help us I did a little more 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.659
 trodden to make you see it better though 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:10.210
 you can do it even less alone 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 enough to give us a little help e 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 then slowly 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.290
 we put the sugar paste 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.900
 so if we want it can be 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.979
 even a little higher I 'll do it for you 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.979
 see it this way 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.160
 the floor plan 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.620
 to admit 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.620
 this master 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 at this point everything 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 you have a little more inside 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.780
 the continuous 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.489
 to do the central part uses goes instead 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:56.010
 sugar paste a little more 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.010
 small water starts 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.090
 then slowly 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.540
 and continues 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.570
 the roll also the final bocciava 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.520
 the thing possibly actually now and 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.080
 if there's something I don't like 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.080
 continue to cisco giorno 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.970
 instead annoyed like here you can put e 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.890
 you can put small pieces of 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.960
 baking paper so that it holds it in 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.510
 this position when it dries up yes 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:30.160
 can you can remove the card from 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:30.160
 oven a little shepherd shine
