00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
might be better yeah not expecting much

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.569 
might be better yeah not expecting much
from<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.149> actually<00:00:49.810> oh<00:00:50.020> shit<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:51.130> kind<00:00:51.489> of

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
from that actually oh shit it's kind of

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.180
