00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.060
 monochrome print factory epson it 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.220
 unique series of printers and MFPs 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.469
 use built-in ink tanks 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.929
 instead of cartridges and possess record 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.790
 low printing cost it does 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 their excellent printing solution 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.000
 documents at home in the office and even in

 monochrome print factory consumes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 maximum current just half ampere 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.580
 it is argued that thanks to this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 low power consumption 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.880
 the device can even work from 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.340
 car cigarette lighter 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's check it for 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.870
 turning the print factory into a mobile 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.170
 we need a car printer 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.379
 110 or 220 volt power inverter 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.469
 not less than 50 watts laptop running 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.120
 windows linux or mac os and monochrome 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.829
 epson printing factory m200 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.489
 supply power to the car inverter 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.489
 through the cigarette lighter 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.520
 connect the print factory to the exit 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520
 inverter 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:21.270
 turn on the device the device is working 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.270
 but will it print fully 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 send print job with 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.159
 computer 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.510
 and in just a few seconds we get 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.510
 print from printer 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.320
 check if the device executes 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 copying documents 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.420

 monochrome print factory epson 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.410
 it is an economical print anytime in
