00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.919 
so here's the week if I can just find
the<00:00:13.830> bottom<00:00:14.190> there<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.610> go<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> haven't

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the bottom there we go so I haven't

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.109 
the bottom there we go so I haven't
tried<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.830> yet<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.460> judging<00:00:17.910> by

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
tried this on just yet but judging by

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.269 
tried this on just yet but judging by
the<00:00:18.300> bottom<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.260> seems<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.680> far<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.100> long

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the bottom it seems to be far too long

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.560 
the bottom it seems to be far too long
so<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.550> might<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> give<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
so I might have to give that bit of a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
so I might have to give that bit of a
trim<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.050> yeah<00:00:22.769> I've<00:00:22.949> been<00:00:22.980> looking<00:00:23.220> forward

to doing this for absolutely ages and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640 
to doing this for absolutely ages and
what<00:00:26.430> comes<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.760> handy<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.930> ages<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
what comes in handy is that ages and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.589 
what comes in handy is that ages and
ages<00:00:28.769> ago<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:29.519> dyed<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> cosplay<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
ages ago when I first dyed to cosplay I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.340 
ages ago when I first dyed to cosplay I
bought<00:00:31.140> myself<00:00:31.460> military<00:00:32.460> Mikasa<00:00:32.790> days<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
bought myself military Mikasa days and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.310 
bought myself military Mikasa days and
it<00:00:34.350> came<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.420> vest<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.989> didn't<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it came with the vest so I didn't have

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
it came with the vest so I didn't have
to<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> vest<00:00:38.640> already<00:00:39.030> habits<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.540> come

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to get the vest already habits that come

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
to get the vest already habits that come
in<00:00:39.780> handy<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.879> I'm<00:00:42.000> basically<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
in handy so what I'm basically going to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.190 
in handy so what I'm basically going to
do<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.140> try<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.559> make<00:00:43.829> Kakashi's<00:00:44.700> mask<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
do is try and make Kakashi's mask as I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.540 
do is try and make Kakashi's mask as I
think<00:00:46.469> I'd<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> lot<00:00:46.800> cheaper<00:00:47.010> than<00:00:47.190> actually

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
think I'd be a lot cheaper than actually

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
think I'd be a lot cheaper than actually
buying<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> Internet<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.950> I'm

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
buying one over the Internet so I'm

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.819 
buying one over the Internet so I'm
going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> try<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:51.809> his<00:00:52.020> mask<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

going to try and make his mask out of
tights<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.239> basically<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
tights so I'm basically just going to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
tights so I'm basically just going to
cut<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> top<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.980> hopefully<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.670> will

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
cut the top off and hopefully that will

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220

fit<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:56.969> my<00:00:57.090> head<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.899> wear<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.170> a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's a turtleneck so lucky enough
actually<00:02:10.740> goes<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.930> my<00:02:13.050> face

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
actually goes all the way up to my face

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.110 
actually goes all the way up to my face
and<00:02:13.290> stays<00:02:13.710> there<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.490> doesn't<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and stays there it doesn't go so it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.010 
and stays there it doesn't go so it
doesn't<00:02:15.360> slide<00:02:15.510> down<00:02:15.570> or<00:02:15.900> anything<00:02:16.490> but<00:02:18.020> this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
doesn't slide down or anything but this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.710 
doesn't slide down or anything but this
is<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.770> original<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.550> made<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:24.600> did

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
is the original that I made so it did

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.010 
is the original that I made so it did
fill<00:02:24.930> me<00:02:25.140> pretty<00:02:25.890> well<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:27.020> my

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
fill me pretty well it's just that my

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.860 
fill me pretty well it's just that my
nose<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.790> pretty<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.600> color

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
nose you can pretty much see the color

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.110 
nose you can pretty much see the color
of<00:02:30.930> my<00:02:31.050> nose<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> yeah<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.480> wasn't<00:02:33.630> any<00:02:33.840> good

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
of my nose so yeah that wasn't any good

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.020 
of my nose so yeah that wasn't any good
but<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.470> thicker<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
but how you can make it thicker is the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.380 
but how you can make it thicker is the
actual<00:02:39.590> tightest<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.880> fold<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.110> so

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
actual tightest and if you fold it in so

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.900 
actual tightest and if you fold it in so
the<00:02:45.390> bottom<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.620> then<00:02:46.860> roll<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.280> up<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.790> go<00:02:47.880> on

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the bottom you then roll it up to go on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400 
the bottom you then roll it up to go on
to<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> top<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.840> show<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.080> together

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
to the top and then you show it together

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.490 
to the top and then you show it together
and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.520> will<00:02:50.610> roughly<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:52.290> size

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and then it will roughly be this size

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
and then it will roughly be this size
and<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.840> my<00:02:54.840> color<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.350> eyes<00:02:55.500> doesn't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
and then my color for my eyes doesn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160 
and then my color for my eyes doesn't
come<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.610> fruit<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.510> I'll<00:02:57.810> show<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:57.989> what<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
come and fruit so I'll show you what I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.449 
come and fruit so I'll show you what I
mean<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.630> put<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.989> your<00:03:01.190> well<00:03:02.190> on

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
your arm and then grab the bottom part

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
just slide it up all the way to the top

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.660 
just slide it up all the way to the top
bit<00:03:11.670> then<00:03:12.660> what<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.459> pull<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:14.489> arm

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
bit then what you do is pull your arm

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.570 
bit then what you do is pull your arm
out<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.230> top<00:03:16.440> bit<00:03:16.650> together<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.250> each<00:03:17.550> of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
out so the top bit together so each of

out so the top bit together so each of
the<00:03:17.790> edges<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.870> then<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.080> can<00:03:19.230> basically<00:03:19.320> put

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
the edges and then you can basically put

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.229 
the edges and then you can basically put
your<00:03:19.890> head<00:03:20.070> through<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.400> bottom<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.940> then

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239

plug<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.720> top<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:22.380> you've<00:03:22.470> got

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
plug it for the top and then you've got

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800 
plug it for the top and then you've got
your<00:03:22.650> mask<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.150> only<00:03:24.269> problem<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.690> me

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
didn't fit me so I stuck with my own

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.180 
didn't fit me so I stuck with my own
original<00:03:35.910> mask<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:37.110> as<00:03:37.560> soon<00:03:37.709> as<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.890> got<00:03:38.070> into

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
original mask but as soon as I got into

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.990 
original mask but as soon as I got into
a<00:03:38.310> close<00:03:38.640> play<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.450> put<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:40.050> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
a close play and I put this on a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.180 
a close play and I put this on a
turtleneck<00:03:42.000> t-shirt<00:03:42.570> on<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.930> realized<00:03:43.739> that

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
turtleneck t-shirt on I realized that

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.910 
turtleneck t-shirt on I realized that
it's<00:03:44.430> long<00:03:44.850> enough<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.680> be<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> mask<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:48.570> I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
it's long enough to be a mask so that I

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.310 
it's long enough to be a mask so that I
so<00:03:49.920> luckily<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:51.540> just<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.200> wear

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
so luckily I can just I can just wear

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.530 
so luckily I can just I can just wear
this<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:52.620> when<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.800> do<00:03:52.860> my<00:03:53.100> Kakashi<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.239> I'll
