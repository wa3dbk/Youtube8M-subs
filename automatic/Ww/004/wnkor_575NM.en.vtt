00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
limited parts and abilities so I thought

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.050 
limited parts and abilities so I thought
I'd<00:02:35.280> build<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.609> mini<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:37.230> mean<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.879> what<00:02:39.030> I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
I'd build a mini and I mean for what I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.869 
I'd build a mini and I mean for what I

you're gonna these things are kind of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.700

he's almost done add that uneven bar
piece<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.230> back<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.870> pretty<00:04:38.870> much

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
piece on the back and that pretty much

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.250 
piece on the back and that pretty much
him<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.440> his<00:04:39.530> car<00:04:40.100> mode<00:04:40.420> but<00:04:41.420> if<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.840> want<00:04:42.080> to

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
him in his car mode but if you want to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.710 
him in his car mode but if you want to
you<00:04:42.590> can<00:04:42.770> add<00:04:42.950> his<00:04:43.400> cannon<00:04:44.410> just<00:04:45.410> like<00:04:45.920> that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
you can add his cannon just like that

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.180 
you can add his cannon just like that
there<00:04:47.720> he<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:47.870> he's<00:04:48.290> in<00:04:48.410> his<00:04:48.500> car<00:04:48.740> mode<00:04:48.980> down

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
there he is he's in his car mode down

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.920 
there he is he's in his car mode down
and<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:50.870> think<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.640> caramel<00:04:53.030> was<00:04:53.510> turned

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
and I think that the caramel was turned

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.150 
and I think that the caramel was turned
out<00:04:54.050> very<00:04:54.110> well<00:04:54.470> too

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
out very well too

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.920 
out very well too
even<00:04:55.910> though<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:56.270> see<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.540> head<00:04:56.720> there

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
even though you can see the head there

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.080 
even though you can see the head there
it<00:04:57.680> still<00:04:57.980> looks<00:04:58.130> really<00:04:58.220> smooth<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:59.030> really

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
it still looks really smooth and really

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.700 
it still looks really smooth and really
nice<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.980> like<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.250> cab<00:05:01.460> it's<00:05:02.270> kind<00:05:02.480> of

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
nice and I like the cab it's kind of

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.870
