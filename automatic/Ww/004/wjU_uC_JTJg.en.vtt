00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.240
 so people what goes from first farmers 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.820
 again with a little gameplay for 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.119
 you and today with a yes one 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.939
 Art guide to the steam fling 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.710
 ok trample him in English and show 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.910
 I'll tell you here first of all where he is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.980
 you can find the parts you have 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.289
 seen going there here to classify 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.000
 the bellows can still lie here and here 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.470
 you see the engine on the table and me 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.850
 Well, I show a new trick how to do that 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.530
 assembling pretty fast on my own 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.149
 there you can also do that 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.440
 remaining spot 10 but I'll show you 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.920
 here is still the bellows 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.899
 yet here are the motor will the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.890
 you'll see later when I do that 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.960
 alone fix and here just 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.910
 also the flag of the fourth and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 last part can be either here 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.809
 or out here at this seat 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.219
 this armchair but as I said that would be 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.010
 now look the same as I show you 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.600
 how to get by yourself quickly and fix the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.950
 Trample him can assemble here 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 we take the flag the bellows have 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.910
 I already and you can see it me 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.800
 Always just quickly pressed iks around that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.560
 lie down and the other again 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.289
 and moves me to it 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.490
 I have two parts in front and soja 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.229
 one can say fast 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 Of course, this is all here 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.369
 I can do that twice as fast here 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.110
 drop a floor down without 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.580
 you have to buy the escalator there 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.310
 be careful because if you are one 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.819
 stock falls then yes last page 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.349
 and here it worked with her 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.810
 By the way, it always comes down to it 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.280
 quickly press iks otherwise stays 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.929
 that part up and then that brings 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.899
 nothing could see her here 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.399
 I still press xxxx fast and 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.420
 also unterm fall still ickx and so 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.649
 I take both parts down with me 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.380
 once down both parts the same 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.830
 In doing so, we have half of it 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.679
 already done and we are waiting now 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.450
 down here just until the elevator from 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.640
 Quake live comes when you are solo 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.209
 Of course, the lift is the elevator of course 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.190
 always on 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.440
 we wait here for a moment to jump on it 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.090
 drive up and pick us up 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 the remaining two parts 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.959
 the whole goes easy in round one me 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.240
 knife then afterwards with me the type on 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.660
 The bag then goes to the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.250
 yes, the last zombie and that's why 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.950
 I then with two legally see here now 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.170
 whose the engine and the second place of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.970
 gitta and I play the same game 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.070
 sometimes it does not work 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 then you can leave it 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.190
 especially with the small engine for him 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 has nothing of great radius there you have to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.730
 move slowly but 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.410
 works anyway and you can see it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.010
 He barred me, then he has to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.780
 unfortunately believe in it then does not help and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.440
 we go the same route again her 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.000
 Look here again for a floor here 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.460
 below and here I am again 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.260
 especially careful because he has the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.700
 jump the field man slightly and then 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.890
 if you fall down two stories like 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 said down and then you're dead 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.190
 and we do not want that and me 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.890
 Do the last ones here fast 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.410
 Two parts forward and then I will 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.660
 you still have some useful steam or 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.550
 spots show some will know 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.110
 maybe others not yet or for 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.180
 people do not own the website itself 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.860
 have shown how the ps3 people are there 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.890
 It 'll be another two weeks soon 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.380
 You can finally play this and here 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.140
 suppose then also place the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.360
 last part and voila finished is the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.770
 Steam tailor assembled very fast 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.630
 just two minutes is always alone and 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.950
 Now I show a few spots here 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.560
 where you can set up the steam control 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.470
 the most obvious of course here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.070
 probably everyone but knows that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.330
 sake of completeness also show the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.580
 We'll take it with you and I'll show you 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.100
 like the next spot maybe 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.570
 not all know here on the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.760
 You can also set mattresses there 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380
 you can get over it on this building but 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 which is not cooler finder is the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.160
 We then yes I thought at the beginning there 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.380
 you probably prefer that 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.100
 pretty far 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.280
 but yes that works and you will 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420
 you 'll see right away we're running on it 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.860
 says Sprint a bit through the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.990
 and then we are on the other side 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.900
 side can be useful if you 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.370
 quickly has to break down by a mile 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.980
 then you can save yourself quite well 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.290
 the next spot if you are in the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.530
 bonner room runs its round and yes for example 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.050
 Ammunition needs for the a 1 or so 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.639
 then this is also a very good offered 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.919
 because normally you can not do that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.750
 back lamps with the steam or but 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.550
 just like you placed up here on the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.639
 pillar and zack one is on the other 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.080
 Side can buy ammunition again and 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.460
 is so prepared for the next one 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.009
 Round and then I'll show you here 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.650
 a yes here is the last spot there 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.879
 two more spots but yes they have 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.740
 I'm not shown now they are too 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.750
 pretty obvious or nothing 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.919
 more useful that's why there are still 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.419
 one next to the power poles next to the da 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.550
 You can also cross over to the other side 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.259
 but this is only useful if you look 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.940
 back to the brother then somebody has to 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.580
 revive or for whatever reason 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.690
 you can also put one here and 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.159
 so comes back in the room 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.520
 and yes, as much to the spots as it said 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.500
 are just a few more but they are 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.159
 obviously or not 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.629
 use 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.310
 that's why I do not have them now 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.289
 shown what I still want to show you 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.629
 yes, you probably know if 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.759
 the nowak scooters are all about all 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.110
 five rounds are coming to a child without one 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.360
 to give a shot then you get one 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.020
 extra mountain and the whole thing works 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.370
 Of course, with the steam hurl 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.599
 I placed you a bit late 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.949
 that's why I have to wait until the 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.870
 but I can load the people 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.029
 pull behind me and then be 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.520
 the shape of the steam slingshot here 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.949
 thawed away and yes quite handy if 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.810
 you like here like me here in 105 yet 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.419
 no bowie knife or similar has 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.039
 because yes you need 3000 and 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.050
 Importers bought for you this 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.069
 show therefore no bowie knife but 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.599
 Of course I do not want to mine 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.639
 dispense free park 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.979
 and that's because here the tactics with 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.000
 the vapor centrifugally also be 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.310
 probably some of you already 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.120
 know or most of the gamble 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.889
 But here then would be the mountain and steam 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.669
 Tailor pretty handy thing I 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.080
 Hope you know go off and I would 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.849
 say, see you at the next video 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.849
 fire weather weather
