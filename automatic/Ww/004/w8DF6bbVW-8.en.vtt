well hello tonight I show you a how to
do<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> leak<00:00:06.089> down<00:00:06.299> test<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> motorcycle

do a leak down test on a motorcycle
reason<00:00:09.480> I'm<00:00:09.540> doing<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> leak<00:00:10.050> down<00:00:10.260> test<00:00:10.590> is

a fella came in with this motorcycle in
front<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.790> me<00:00:15.020> he<00:00:16.020> tried<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> start<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:16.949> the

front of me he tried to start it for the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.820 
front of me he tried to start it for the
first<00:00:17.190> time<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.609> year<00:00:18.619> turned<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> over

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
first time this year turned it over

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.230 
first time this year turned it over
turned<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.310> over<00:00:20.369> turned<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> over<00:00:20.850> turn<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240

turned it over turned it over turn it
over<00:00:21.300> his<00:00:21.539> own<00:00:21.689> big<00:00:22.080> backfire<00:00:23.029> sounded<00:00:24.029> like

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
over his own big backfire sounded like

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.170 
over his own big backfire sounded like
something<00:00:24.449> broke<00:00:24.750> he<00:00:25.080> said<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
something broke he said and it just

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.939 
something broke he said and it just
wouldn't<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.810> fact<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> starter

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
wouldn't start in fact the starter

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009 
wouldn't start in fact the starter
wouldn't<00:00:29.220> turn<00:00:29.340> over<00:00:29.660> which<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.779> always<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
wouldn't turn over which is always a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680 
wouldn't turn over which is always a
scary<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.820> usually<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.329> indication

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
scary thing usually that's an indication

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.479 
scary thing usually that's an indication
something<00:00:34.170> majors<00:00:34.530> happen

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
something majors happen

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
something majors happen
turns<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> case<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> I'll<00:00:36.989> talk

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
turns out not the case and I'll talk

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
turns out not the case and I'll talk
about<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.980> second<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.670> thought

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
about that just a second but I thought

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
about that just a second but I thought
if<00:00:41.090> if<00:00:42.090> there's<00:00:42.719> ever<00:00:42.989> any<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
if if there's ever any time to do a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
if if there's ever any time to do a
diagnostic<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> engine<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
diagnostic on the engine now is it and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.310 
diagnostic on the engine now is it and
that<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.180> I've<00:00:48.329> decided<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.110> run<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that what I've decided to do is run a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.549 
that what I've decided to do is run a
quick<00:00:49.530> leak<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:49.980> test<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.789> engine

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
quick leak down test on the engine

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
quick leak down test on the engine
there's<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.710> kinds<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> compression<00:00:53.730> tests

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
there's two kinds of compression tests

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
there's two kinds of compression tests
you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.230> engine<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> leak

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you can do on an engine get do a leak

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
you can do on an engine get do a leak
down<00:00:56.219> test<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> conventional

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
down test and you can do a conventional

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.729 
down test and you can do a conventional
compression<00:00:58.350> test<00:00:59.570> leak<00:01:00.570> down<00:01:00.750> doesn't<00:01:01.260> test

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
compression test leak down doesn't test

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
compression test leak down doesn't test
compression<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.550> much<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> does<00:01:03.449> engine

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
compression as much as it does engine

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
compression as much as it does engine
sealing<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:05.070> results<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.670> compression<00:01:06.860> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sealing which results in compression so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
sealing which results in compression so
what<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> run<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
what I did was I was going to run a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.929 
what I did was I was going to run a
compression<00:01:10.049> test<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> simply<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
compression test which is simply the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
compression test which is simply the
amount<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> pressure<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.990> engine<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.380> build

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
amount of pressure the engine can build

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.490 
amount of pressure the engine can build
up<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> spin<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> starter<00:01:15.500> instead

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
up when you spin the starter instead

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
up when you spin the starter instead
I've<00:01:16.619> decided<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I've decided to do this because this is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
I've decided to do this because this is
much<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.290> indicative<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.580> health<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
much more indicative of the health of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.170 
much more indicative of the health of
the<00:01:20.970> engine<00:01:21.830> how<00:01:22.830> long<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.369> hold<00:01:23.610> pressure

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the engine how long it can hold pressure

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.100 
the engine how long it can hold pressure
and<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.490> degree<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.150> allows<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.840> built

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and to what degree it allows the built

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
and to what degree it allows the built
gas<00:01:28.979> pressure<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> leak<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> engine

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
gas pressure to leak from the engine

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.749

emotion Pro tool it's not a top shelf
tool<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:47.040> still<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.399> expensive

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
tool but they're still very expensive

tool but they're still very expensive
I'm<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.140> probably<00:01:49.500> cost<00:01:49.649> me<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> couple

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I'm not this probably cost me a couple

hundred dollars this kit comes with I
like<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:53.939> motion<00:01:54.420> Pro<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
like it because motion Pro is a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
like it because motion Pro is a
motorcycle<00:01:55.140> specific<00:01:55.860> company<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:57.000> know

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
air to plug into this gizmo so I have

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.150 
air to plug into this gizmo so I have
that<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> source<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:50.590> pressed<00:02:51.590> air<00:02:51.770> here

that I have a source of pressed air here

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.970 
that I have a source of pressed air here
and<00:02:52.340> there's<00:02:52.900> essentially<00:02:53.900> I'm<00:02:54.320> running<00:02:54.890> at

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
and there's essentially I'm running at

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.440 
and there's essentially I'm running at
about<00:02:55.160> 120<00:02:55.790> psi<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.880> do<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.180> test

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
about 120 psi and to do the test

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.840 
about 120 psi and to do the test
effectively<00:03:00.410> I'll<00:03:01.310> go<00:03:01.520> through<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> steps

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
effectively I'll go through the steps

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.690 
effectively I'll go through the steps
you<00:03:02.420> take<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.290> your<00:03:03.590> leak<00:03:03.739> down<00:03:03.950> tester<00:03:04.130> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
you take your your leak down tester and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.810 
you take your your leak down tester and
you<00:03:05.000> zero<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.570> by<00:03:05.989> setting<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.890> adjustment

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
you zero it by setting the adjustment

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.490 
you zero it by setting the adjustment
all<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> way<00:03:08.239> down<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.570> zero<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.230> doesn't

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
all the way down to zero so it doesn't

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.070 
all the way down to zero so it doesn't
damage<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.519> tool<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.910> case<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.480> air

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
damage the the tool in case the air

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.729 
damage the the tool in case the air
pressure<00:03:12.410> source<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:13.220> high<00:03:13.750> high<00:03:14.750> pressure<00:03:15.110> so

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
pressure source is high high pressure so

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.580 
pressure source is high high pressure so
you<00:03:15.830> plug<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.160> tool<00:03:16.880> in<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.360> then<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.230> wind

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
you plug this tool in and then you wind

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.050 
you plug this tool in and then you wind
this<00:03:18.799> back<00:03:18.860> down<00:03:19.310> I'm<00:03:19.519> not<00:03:19.640> sure<00:03:19.820> if<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:19.970> can

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
this back down I'm not sure if you can

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.030 
this back down I'm not sure if you can

it plugged in and do two tests hookups
to<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> cylinder<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.380> what<00:03:42.470> I've<00:03:42.590> done<00:03:42.739> is

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
to the cylinder and what I've done is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.890 
to the cylinder and what I've done is
I've<00:03:42.980> taken<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.400> appropriate<00:03:43.730> there's<00:03:44.540> three

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
I've taken the appropriate there's three

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.680 
I've taken the appropriate there's three
different<00:03:45.310> adapters<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.519> is<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.940> adapter

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
different adapters this is the adapter

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.360 
different adapters this is the adapter
that<00:03:47.959> fits<00:03:48.019> into<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.590> spark<00:03:48.950> plug<00:03:49.160> holes

hold<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.890> make<00:04:04.890> sure<00:04:05.099> it's<00:04:05.250> zeros<00:04:05.489> out<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.849> it

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
hold on make sure it's zeros out and it

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.899 
hold on make sure it's zeros out and it
did<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.959> set<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.500> zero<00:04:07.739> it's<00:04:08.340> set<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.580> one

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
did it get set to zero it's set to one

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.789 
did it get set to zero it's set to one
so<00:04:09.659> I<00:04:09.690> reset<00:04:10.409> it<00:04:10.440> back<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.709> zero<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:12.799> now

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
so I reset it back to zero do it now

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.870 
so I reset it back to zero do it now
it's<00:04:14.099> zero<00:04:16.040> back<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.220> zero<00:04:17.400> we<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.669> want<00:04:17.820> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
it's zero back to zero we just want to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.129 
it's zero back to zero we just want to
make<00:04:17.970> sure<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.209> keeps<00:04:18.299> resetting<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.810> zero

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
make sure it keeps resetting to zero

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:31.719 
make sure it keeps resetting to zero
then<00:04:20.130> we<00:04:20.160> do<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> test

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.320 

hold<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:33.000> gauge<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.340> we're<00:04:35.340> at<00:04:35.430> 10%<00:04:35.850> leak

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
hold the gauge up and we're at 10% leak

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.159 
hold the gauge up and we're at 10% leak
down<00:04:36.570> okay

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
down okay

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.320 
down okay
so<00:04:38.039> this<00:04:38.400> measures<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.419> tool<00:04:39.720> effectively

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
so this measures this tool effectively

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.279 
so this measures this tool effectively
talked<00:04:42.330> about<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.720> health<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:45.289> tool

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
talked about the health of that tool

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.270 
talked about the health of that tool
effectively<00:04:46.500> measures<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:48.510> rate<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.280> air

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
effectively measures the rate of air

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.840 
effectively measures the rate of air

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
movement from the air source the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.790 
movement from the air source the
variance<00:04:54.210> between<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.780> air<00:04:54.930> source<00:04:55.350> rate<00:04:55.650> of

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
variance between the air source rate of

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.460 
variance between the air source rate of
movement<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.030> air<00:04:57.180> source<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.840> the

okay<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.979> combustion<00:05:02.310> chamber<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.840> it's<00:05:03.960> a

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
okay the combustion chamber so it's a

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.830 
okay the combustion chamber so it's a
percentage<00:05:04.590> it's<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.400> rate<00:05:05.789> comparison<00:05:06.599> not<00:05:06.780> a

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
percentage it's a rate comparison not a

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.260 
percentage it's a rate comparison not a
volume<00:05:07.320> comparison<00:05:07.860> okay<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:08.849> that's<00:05:09.030> why

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
volume comparison okay and that's why

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.779 
volume comparison okay and that's why
it's<00:05:09.389> so<00:05:09.539> accurate<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.860> if<00:05:10.979> we<00:05:11.160> had<00:05:11.430> air

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
it's so accurate so if we had air

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.070 
it's so accurate so if we had air
movement

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
movement

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.219

we<00:05:13.830> had<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.950> high<00:05:14.160> hissing<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> we<00:05:15.810> wanted<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
we had a high hissing and we wanted the

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.080 
we had a high hissing and we wanted the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
sense where that air is going to what we

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.370 
sense where that air is going to what we
could<00:05:18.270> do<00:05:18.419> is<00:05:18.479> we<00:05:18.599> could<00:05:18.690> put<00:05:18.870> our<00:05:18.960> hand<00:05:19.229> in

remote<00:06:16.660> involves<00:06:17.350> taking<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.490> engine<00:06:18.639> out<00:06:18.970> of

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
remote involves taking the engine out of

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.480 
remote involves taking the engine out of
the<00:06:19.630> chassis<00:06:20.340> popping<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.460> heads<00:06:21.669> off<00:06:21.970> and

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
the chassis popping the heads off and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.640 
the chassis popping the heads off and
you<00:06:24.490> know<00:06:24.610> rebury<00:06:25.150> sometimes<00:06:25.870> resurfacing

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
you know rebury sometimes resurfacing

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.760 
you know rebury sometimes resurfacing
those<00:06:26.919> decks<00:06:27.870> or<00:06:28.870> at<00:06:28.960> least<00:06:29.110> cleaning<00:06:29.590> them

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
those decks or at least cleaning them

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.879 
those decks or at least cleaning them
and<00:06:29.919> then<00:06:30.400> pulling<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:31.630> piston<00:06:32.200> out<00:06:32.290> it

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
and then pulling the the piston out it

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.340 
and then pulling the the piston out it
would<00:06:33.100> be<00:06:33.280> an<00:06:33.669> all<00:06:33.790> weekend<00:06:34.300> type<00:06:34.540> type<00:06:35.020> job

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
would be an all weekend type type job

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.620 
would be an all weekend type type job
for<00:06:36.220> us<00:06:36.280> we<00:06:36.460> had<00:06:36.580> 10%<00:06:36.850> in<00:06:37.240> this<00:06:37.360> cylinder

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
for us we had 10% in this cylinder

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.629 
for us we had 10% in this cylinder
before<00:06:38.139> I<00:06:38.169> started<00:06:38.530> recording<00:06:38.620> this<00:06:39.070> actually

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
before I started recording this actually

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.150 
before I started recording this actually
got<00:06:39.820> a<00:06:39.850> reading<00:06:40.120> of<00:06:40.300> 12%<00:06:40.720> on<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.200> rear<00:06:41.410> so<00:06:42.040> I'm

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
got a reading of 12% on the rear so I'm

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.670 
got a reading of 12% on the rear so I'm
happy<00:06:42.370> with<00:06:42.610> that<00:06:42.669> so<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.840> engines<00:06:44.200> healthy

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
happy with that so the engines healthy

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.040 
happy with that so the engines healthy
which<00:06:45.130> means<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:45.669> backfire<00:06:46.150> didn't<00:06:46.600> damage

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
which means the backfire didn't damage

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.700 
which means the backfire didn't damage
as<00:06:47.740> far<00:06:48.070> as<00:06:48.190> I<00:06:48.280> can<00:06:48.340> see<00:06:48.990> as<00:06:49.990> far<00:06:50.229> as<00:06:50.320> this<00:06:50.470> tells

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
as far as I can see as far as this tells

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.290 
as far as I can see as far as this tells
me<00:06:50.830> you<00:06:50.979> didn't<00:06:51.310> damage<00:06:51.490> the<00:06:51.639> engine<00:06:51.880> itself

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
me you didn't damage the engine itself

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.270 
me you didn't damage the engine itself
what<00:06:52.870> I'm<00:06:52.990> thinking<00:06:53.440> is<00:06:53.590> and<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:53.800> haven't<00:06:54.010> taken

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
what I'm thinking is and I haven't taken

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.070 
what I'm thinking is and I haven't taken
off<00:06:54.490> this<00:06:54.669> air<00:06:54.880> filter<00:06:55.060> yet<00:06:55.450> what<00:06:55.990> I'm

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
off this air filter yet what I'm

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.900 
off this air filter yet what I'm
thinking<00:06:56.470> is<00:06:56.650> if<00:06:56.889> it<00:06:57.130> was<00:06:57.250> a<00:06:57.280> really<00:06:57.610> heavy

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
thinking is if it was a really heavy

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.780 
thinking is if it was a really heavy
backfire<00:06:58.479> there's<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.169> possibility<00:06:59.790> because

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
backfire there's a possibility because

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.810 
backfire there's a possibility because
I've<00:07:00.970> I<00:07:01.720> think<00:07:02.169> I<00:07:02.470> rejected<00:07:02.950> this<00:07:03.100> bike<00:07:03.310> Oh<00:07:03.460> 10

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
I've I think I rejected this bike Oh 10

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.060 
I've I think I rejected this bike Oh 10
years<00:07:04.030> ago<00:07:04.300> it's<00:07:04.960> a<00:07:05.020> possibility<00:07:05.470> it<00:07:05.800> popped

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
years ago it's a possibility it popped

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.140 
years ago it's a possibility it popped
the<00:07:06.250> carburetor<00:07:06.729> off<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:08.620> boot<00:07:09.520> which<00:07:09.940> isn't

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
the carburetor off the boot which isn't

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.500 
the carburetor off the boot which isn't
a<00:07:10.300> big<00:07:10.450> deal<00:07:10.660> to<00:07:10.840> fix<00:07:11.110> it's<00:07:11.919> a<00:07:12.160> good<00:07:13.000> job<00:07:13.240> and

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
a big deal to fix it's a good job and

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.480 
a big deal to fix it's a good job and
without<00:07:13.630> that<00:07:13.960> seated<00:07:14.500> on<00:07:14.650> there<00:07:15.100> getting<00:07:15.400> a

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
without that seated on there getting a

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.550 
without that seated on there getting a
good<00:07:15.639> seal<00:07:15.940> in<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.419> in<00:07:16.510> trait<00:07:16.780> intake<00:07:17.229> tract

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
good seal in the in trait intake tract

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.260 
good seal in the in trait intake tract
that<00:07:17.890> probably<00:07:18.370> would<00:07:18.610> prevent<00:07:18.910> the<00:07:19.090> bike

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
that probably would prevent the bike

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.159 
that probably would prevent the bike
from<00:07:19.450> starting<00:07:19.870> so<00:07:21.060> that<00:07:22.060> is<00:07:22.240> that<00:07:22.479> so<00:07:22.810> a<00:07:22.840> link

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
from starting so that is that so a link

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.520 
from starting so that is that so a link
down<00:07:23.289> test<00:07:23.650> or<00:07:23.830> motion<00:07:24.190> Pro<00:07:24.570> there's<00:07:25.570> probably

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
down test or motion Pro there's probably

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.710 
down test or motion Pro there's probably
better<00:07:26.830> quality<00:07:27.610> tools<00:07:27.880> than<00:07:28.090> this<00:07:28.240> out<00:07:28.419> there

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
better quality tools than this out there

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.590 
better quality tools than this out there
but<00:07:29.350> this<00:07:29.590> one<00:07:29.650> does<00:07:30.010> the<00:07:30.160> trick<00:07:30.400> for<00:07:30.430> me<00:07:30.850> I<00:07:31.120> do

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
but this one does the trick for me I do

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.630 
but this one does the trick for me I do
this<00:07:32.080> probably<00:07:32.470> four<00:07:32.890> or<00:07:32.979> five<00:07:33.130> times<00:07:33.400> a<00:07:33.610> year

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640 
this probably four or five times a year

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.610 
this probably four or five times a year
so<00:07:34.060> I<00:07:34.090> don't<00:07:34.330> need<00:07:34.510> anything<00:07:34.900> more<00:07:35.200> robust<00:07:35.590> in

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
so I don't need anything more robust in

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.700 
so I don't need anything more robust in
this<00:07:35.979> tool<00:07:36.250> so<00:07:36.970> I<00:07:37.000> reset<00:07:37.390> it<00:07:37.419> to<00:07:37.510> zero<00:07:37.810> lock<00:07:38.530> it

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
this tool so I reset it to zero lock it

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.520 
this tool so I reset it to zero lock it
back<00:07:38.830> in<00:07:39.160> put<00:07:39.490> it<00:07:39.580> away<00:07:39.669> and<00:07:39.789> I'm<00:07:40.000> good<00:07:40.150> to<00:07:40.180> go

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
back in put it away and I'm good to go

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.029 
back in put it away and I'm good to go
great<00:07:41.530> tool<00:07:41.800> if<00:07:42.220> you're<00:07:43.110> not<00:07:44.110> worth<00:07:44.680> it<00:07:44.860> if

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 
great tool if you're not worth it if

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.190 
great tool if you're not worth it if
you're<00:07:45.190> just<00:07:45.220> doing<00:07:45.729> one<00:07:45.880> bite<00:07:46.120> but<00:07:46.479> probably

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.200 
you're just doing one bite but probably

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.659 
you're just doing one bite but probably
worth<00:07:47.440> it<00:07:47.620> if<00:07:47.710> you're<00:07:47.830> going<00:07:47.979> to<00:07:48.100> work<00:07:48.250> on<00:07:48.460> all

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:48.669 
worth it if you're going to work on all

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.180 
worth it if you're going to work on all
your<00:07:48.729> bikes<00:07:49.120> on<00:07:49.360> a<00:07:49.389> go-forward<00:07:49.630> basis<00:07:50.289> anyway

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.190 
your bikes on a go-forward basis anyway

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.570 
your bikes on a go-forward basis anyway
until<00:07:51.669> next<00:07:51.789> time<00:07:52.150> take<00:07:52.510> care
