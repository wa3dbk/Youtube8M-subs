00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to shoot a competitive landscape of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.779

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
but it's certainly not big compared to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.530 
but it's certainly not big compared to
an<00:01:05.159> iPad<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:09.530> here<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.100> sense

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you want to engage in thumb type in

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.140 
you want to engage in thumb type in
which<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.320> something<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.920> you've<00:03:23.700> been<00:03:23.850> used

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
which is something that you've been used

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.660 
which is something that you've been used
to<00:03:24.330> from<00:03:24.720> maybe<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:26.040> decade<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.970> thumb<00:03:27.240> typing

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
to from maybe a decade of thumb typing

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.340 
to from maybe a decade of thumb typing
it's<00:03:29.670> hard<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.870> thumb<00:03:31.140> doesn't

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
it's hard because the thumb doesn't

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.030 
it's hard because the thumb doesn't
reach<00:03:31.920> not<00:03:32.310> even<00:03:32.550> half<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.690> screen<00:03:34.040> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
reach not even half of the screen and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.750 
reach not even half of the screen and
when<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.520> hold<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:37.740> is<00:03:37.950> very<00:03:38.220> difficult<00:03:38.400> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
when you hold it it is very difficult to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.540 
when you hold it it is very difficult to
both<00:03:39.000> hold<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.690> type<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.500> if<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.250> put<00:03:41.430> it

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
both hold it and type and if you put it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.990 
both hold it and type and if you put it
down<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.780> type<00:03:43.110> in<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.160> hand<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.790> like

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
down and you type in your hand is like

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.699 
down and you type in your hand is like
these<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.510> then<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.750> cannot<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.260> see

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
these and then you cannot really see

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.400 
these and then you cannot really see
what<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.070> type<00:03:47.430> very<00:03:47.790> well<00:03:48.170> what's<00:03:49.170> good

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
what you type very well what's good

what you type very well what's good
about<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.800> dell<00:03:50.130> streak<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.910> when<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.270> type

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
about the dell streak is when you type

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.430 
about the dell streak is when you type
your<00:03:52.140> thumb<00:03:52.860> which<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.790> over<00:03:54.630> half<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.260> the

your thumb which is over half of the
screen<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.720> therefore<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.620> type<00:04:01.280> also

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
screen and therefore you can type also

you can type in vertical mode where the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.670 
you can type in vertical mode where the
thumbs<00:04:05.730> are<00:04:05.970> not<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.450> crammed<00:04:06.900> together<00:04:07.170> as

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
thumbs are not so crammed together as

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.240 
thumbs are not so crammed together as

they would be on an iphone when you do
the<00:04:11.400> same<00:04:11.640> thing<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.450> when<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.750> type<00:04:13.430> in

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the same thing you know when you type in

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.310 
the same thing you know when you type in
terms<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.989> applications<00:04:15.989> i<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.560> i<00:04:17.010> like<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
terms of applications i like i like the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.950 
terms of applications i like i like the
android<00:04:19.320> in<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.130> sense<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.549> it's

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
android in the sense that it's

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.430 
android in the sense that it's
independent<00:04:21.960> of<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.530> laptop

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.810 

laptops<00:04:26.440> are<00:04:27.150> essential<00:04:28.150> for<00:04:28.180> Apple<00:04:28.990> products

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
laptops are essential for Apple products

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.900 
laptops are essential for Apple products
but<00:04:30.820> they're<00:04:31.000> not<00:04:31.350> needed<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.860> synchronize<00:04:33.520> in

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
but they're not needed to synchronize in

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.240 
but they're not needed to synchronize in
androids<00:04:34.660> which<00:04:34.960> synchronize<00:04:35.560> over<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> air

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
androids which synchronize over the air

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.100 
androids which synchronize over the air
so<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.550> get<00:04:36.730> your<00:04:36.760> applications<00:04:37.630> over<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
so you get your applications over the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.240 
so you get your applications over the
air<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:39.100> go<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.550> market<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.530> if<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.980> had

air you go to the market and if you had

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.360 
air you go to the market and if you had
another<00:04:42.700> one<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.830> had<00:04:44.920> another<00:04:47.370> Android

another one if you had another Android
like<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.790> did<00:04:49.090> when<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.230> go<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.860> market<00:04:51.430> you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
like I did when you go to the market you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.160 
like I did when you go to the market you
find<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:54.070> same<00:04:54.840> applications<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.080> you

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
find that the same applications that you

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.950 
find that the same applications that you
had<00:04:56.350> bought<00:04:56.590> are<00:04:57.150> synchronized<00:04:58.150> over<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.660> air

had bought are synchronized over the air

had bought are synchronized over the air
and<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.919> don't<00:05:00.220> need<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.669> use<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.880> laptop<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.870> I

and you don't need to use a laptop and I

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.310 
and you don't need to use a laptop and I
have<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.400> dislike<00:05:04.150> for<00:05:04.890> highly<00:05:05.890> opinionated

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
reviewers who are like a hundred percent

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
with Apple because they really are two

different<00:05:16.270> ways<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.780> doing<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:18.010> same<00:05:18.280> thing<00:05:18.790> I

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
different ways of doing the same thing I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.890 
different ways of doing the same thing I
think<00:05:20.050> many<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.620> us<00:05:20.770> who<00:05:21.010> are<00:05:21.070> used<00:05:21.430> to

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
think many of us who are used to

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.120 
think many of us who are used to
keyboards<00:05:22.900> are<00:05:23.080> going<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.410> have<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.770> give<00:05:23.950> them

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
keyboards are going to have to give them

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.659 
keyboards are going to have to give them
up<00:05:24.340> because<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.680> retrain<00:05:26.680> ourselves<00:05:26.950> because

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
up because and retrain ourselves because

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.969 
up because and retrain ourselves because
it<00:05:27.820> is<00:05:28.440> sad<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.830> lose<00:05:30.100> so<00:05:30.460> much<00:05:30.700> real<00:05:31.030> estate

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
it is sad to lose so much real estate

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.950 
it is sad to lose so much real estate
screen<00:05:32.979> real<00:05:33.250> estate<00:05:33.460> for<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.630> keyboard<00:05:35.580> so

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
screen real estate for a keyboard so

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
but if I walk around I don't feel the

wait<00:06:41.430> overall<00:06:42.430> i<00:06:42.460> recommend<00:06:43.210> the<00:06:43.360> dell<00:06:44.110> streak

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440

wait overall i recommend the dell streak
i<00:06:44.770> think<00:06:45.039> it<00:06:45.550> is<00:06:45.759> a<00:06:45.789> winning<00:06:46.300> format<00:06:46.840> at<00:06:47.080> least

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
i think it is a winning format at least

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.990 
i think it is a winning format at least
it<00:06:47.949> is<00:06:48.160> for<00:06:48.430> me<00:06:48.639> I<00:06:49.630> think<00:06:50.500> that<00:06:50.770> the<00:06:51.280> size<00:06:51.550> is

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
it is for me I think that the size is

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.290 
it is for me I think that the size is
big<00:06:52.479> but<00:06:52.780> not<00:06:52.840> humongous<00:06:53.620> I<00:06:53.889> think<00:06:54.639> you<00:06:54.819> you<00:06:55.120> do

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
big but not humongous I think you you do

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.540 
big but not humongous I think you you do
look<00:06:55.479> kind<00:06:55.900> of<00:06:56.020> silly<00:06:56.289> but<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.830> is<00:06:56.979> possible<00:06:57.490> to

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
look kind of silly but it is possible to

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.879 
look kind of silly but it is possible to
speak<00:06:57.970> on<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.240> phone<00:06:58.270> and<00:06:59.229> of<00:06:59.349> course<00:06:59.620> you<00:06:59.740> can

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
speak on the phone and of course you can

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.439 
speak on the phone and of course you can
always<00:07:00.009> use<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:02.039> bluetooth<00:07:03.090> sets<00:07:04.090> or
