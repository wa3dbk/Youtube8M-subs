00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.580
 Maxim Zubarev German restorer 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.270
 techniques of the times of the great national 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.609
 checks the pride of his collection 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.629
 German ferry is the progenitor 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.909
 modern audi 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.279
 military cars in general jeeps yes they are not 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.499
 They are complex usually is 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.029
 there is well four cylinders and this 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.920
 enough and men are known 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.869
 put up the number of cylinders virgin in those 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.179
 years the same the more the cylinder 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.880
 higher class and it was thought that 4 cylinder 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.939
 economy class 6 cylinder business class 8 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.189
 Cylinders are also luxury cars 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.329
 has a 4 liter engine but its 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.260
 power compared to modern 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.750
 by cars 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.309
 only small 90 horsepower and yes 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 speed not more than one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.960
 at the same time it weighs almost 3 tons 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.430
 Now collector Maxim Zubarev 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 entrusted me with one of his loved ones 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.859
 instances of this horch 901 on this machine 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.750
 German generals moved as well 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.079
 as a trophy marshal rode on it 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 Zhukov 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.769
 but today my passengers are not generals 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.769
 and children develop in half 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.990
 yes it is certainly not modern car 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.590
 no gear steering antennae 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 mechanical box but still goes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 brightly 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 it feels like it becomes 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 executive class 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.790
 how did you like it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 although the restorer was very worried about his 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780
 car i persuaded him to let me 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.780
 take another lap behind the wheel of german 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 38 year old legends feeling super 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.570
 at the same time a little pumped lied 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 participated and many other unique 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.550
 cars such as the first 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 Soviet SUV r1 and l1 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.470
 their two copies were manufactured tell 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.680
 so this is the prototype for the blocker 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.660
 all these things that we say were tested 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.000
 ideas that were needed for war 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.010
 most of the cars that drove by 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.690
 the highway belongs not to the museum but to the private 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.040
 collectors and the owner 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 It was necessary to carefully restore 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.020
 valuable cars sometimes took years 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.970
 to the question why they do meet 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.100
 to the younger generation 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 remembered his past particular not 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.390
 I forget about the horrors of war, the history of Russia 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.739
 need to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.959
 feel like it was during 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.060
 Forties it is necessary to know 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.280
 and this is the technique by which we 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.140
 today we will go 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.810
 the feeling is a very super-duper Egor 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.810
