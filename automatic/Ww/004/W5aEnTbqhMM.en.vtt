00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.270
 good afternoon today I will cook 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.250
 lazy belyashi 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.680
 the mercy of this recipe is that here 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.280
 used dough like yeast 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.110
 pancakes 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.450
 that is, it does not require a long 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 imasheva not me mixing everything is preparing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410
 fairly quickly and easily required 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 some time to yeast 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 we were able to raise the dough 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
 so let's start for the test we need 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.800
 about a half cup of milk 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.830
 add milk I have fresh yeast 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.630
 yeast is about 20 grams if 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 will use dry yeast then 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.610
 take a teaspoon 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 give the yeast some time to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.160
 so that they dissolve and go into 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 the solution then add the egg here 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 add sugar and add salt can 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.899
 add one two tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.059
 and a teaspoon of salt and stir 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.449
 add flour add flour to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.609
 consistency of dough like pancakes on 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.510
 a half cup of milk took 2 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.070
 cups of flour 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.030
 but you can take a little more flour 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 a little less because the flour is different everywhere 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 add flour a little each time 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 well stirring the very beginning flour 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.110
 will be very reluctant to go over the solution 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 will clump up 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 okay these lumps then 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 it will gradually disperse from the fact that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.220
 flour we have is easier than milk it floats on 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.130
 surfaces of course it would be more correct 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 add flour milk but powerful stage 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 calling you must fail 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 thick dough it will no longer drain with 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.920
 spoons and will be so lazy to crawl here 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 approximately the same consistency and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.210
 late add to the vegetable dough 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.509
 butter 1 tablespoon would be 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 enough then stir everything 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.430
 cover the dough 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 or a plate or film and leave 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.719
 in a warm place to lift the test we 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.829
 should increase in volume by about 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.320
 twice the rise time depends on 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.329
 ambient temperature average 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.890
 it is somewhere 40 minutes maybe 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:15.780
 hour dough came to me for the first time 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.890
 remove the film it is stirred it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.360
 should we have then again 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.819
 bowl with dough and cover with film 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.100
 or skeet and leave for 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.140
 secondary climb as a protest with us 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.770
 will fit the second time possible 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.410
 stir we will not bake belyashi 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.090
 for the stuffing I need mince it 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 I only needed the amount of dough 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.569
 200 grams of mince I have pork with 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.040
 I stuffed beef with salted pepper and 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.200
 in order to me the meat filling is not 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.570
 I was dry I minced some water 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 instead of water and add milk kefir 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.040
 You can add sour cream during such 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.870
 the amount of fluid that we have 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.350
 It turned out viscous mass that you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.269
 you can easily smudge the targets and you take me 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.820
 I'll be on a slow fire small 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.709
 amount of vegetable oil 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.660
 spread yeast dough with a spoon 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.280
 in order that dough was better saved 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.209
 spoons wet the spoon either in 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.209
 vegetable oil 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.760
 or in the water top lay out the meat 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.549
 stuffing for every berish I took 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.190
 about a teaspoon of minced rolled up 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.200
 he had a ball mashed into a cake and then these 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.690
 meat pellets I would come out on top 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.269
 then we cover up the dough 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.150
 above about a tablespoon of dough 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.239
 and distribute in such a way that we 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.370
 the meat filling was completely closed 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.230
 so that the belyashi will be fried I will 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.140
 fry over low heat 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.070
 fry the lid on both sides 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.890
 until golden brown cover with a lid 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.540
 when we have a crust with one 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 sides belyashi and neatly 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.070
 turn and fry with another 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.410
 the sides, too, to the ground and also under 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.970
 lid, if necessary, you can add 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.980
 little vegetable oil 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.470
 and how much yeast dough is very active 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 absorbs the oil in order to belyashi 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.820
 and turned out less fat you can 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.590
 add it two stages at 1 and compressed with 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.660
 one side and then after 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.940
 choose and flip after 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.650
 all crossed will be fried one of them 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.750
 describe on version 1 and check pro 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.849
 ball if stuffing if not suddenly 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.370
 roasted then put belyashi 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.970
 either in the oven and in the microwave then 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 readiness 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.090
 stuffing from so much dough and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.860
 minced I got 15 whites line 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.960
 you belyashi ready and will remain 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.500
 unconventional wish you a pleasant 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.500
 appetite
