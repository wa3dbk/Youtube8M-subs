not a fan of this one it just didn't
come<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.100> as<00:02:38.250> nice<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.750> sunny<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
come out as nice it is sunny with the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.310 
come out as nice it is sunny with the
chance<00:02:40.320> which<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.070> also<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.600> as<00:02:42.900> old

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
chance which was also and that as old

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.960 
chance which was also and that as old

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
but still I mean it's not being aired

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.020 
but still I mean it's not being aired
it's<00:02:45.120> probably<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.480> five<00:02:45.720> years<00:02:45.870> old<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.260> so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
it's probably like five years old or so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.500 
it's probably like five years old or so
but<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.120> looks<00:02:48.330> nice<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.590> item<00:02:50.240> not<00:02:51.240> my

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
but it looks nice just item not my

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.260 
but it looks nice just item not my
favorite<00:02:53.510> next<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:56.010> right<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.760> nice<00:02:56.940> one

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
favorite next all right have a nice one

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.350 
favorite next all right have a nice one
it<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:58.410> electric<00:02:58.860> blue<00:02:59.250> teal<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.120> then

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it is electric blue teal and then

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.449 
it is electric blue teal and then
Phineas<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.990> Ferb<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.770> pocket<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.430> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
Phineas and Ferb for the pocket so I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.630 
Phineas and Ferb for the pocket so I
guess<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.209> gives<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.570> away<00:03:04.430> billfold<00:03:05.430> is
