00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.550
 faith of the favorite foods of the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.620
 Argentines who have mozzarella because 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.780
 It has an Italian name but it is a dish 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 well Argentinian because it's the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.550
 perfecting a dish that will be 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.740
 perfect because everyone ever the 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.380
 ate 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.240
 This is number 3 of the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.960
 favorite foods of Argentines that 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.080
 they carry mozzarella 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.090
 the Milanese to the Neapolitan 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.410
 when I'm claudio up I'm the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.410
 restaurant chef Sunday 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 the secret to making a miranda 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.410
 Neapolitanism resides in the quality of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 raw material both in the in the meat 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.380
 like in the mozzarella and it's also in 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.380
 touch 0 that is in the in the sauce fileto 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.730
 what I do to look like Milanese 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.299
 Neapolitan once we have the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.460
 milanese buttocks will apply 180 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.460
 degrees for about 3 minutes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.230
 and then you have to dry it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.970
 and add the ham filet sauce 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.970
 cooked the mozzarella 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.009
 and then gratin on the road 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.479
 for two minutes in the case of no 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.420
 have a jacket I can do it in the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.509
 oven strong support when golden brown 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 mozzarella is removed and placed in 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:45.550
 one in a table or on a plate together with 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.110
 a little bit of oregano black olives 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.150
 and the corresponding garrison 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.610
 it is usually accompanied with potatoes 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.320
 fries or rustic potatoes but I think that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.930
 with a good fresh salad for 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 cut so much frying I think it's going to 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.340
 be good to the palate and also to health 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.170
 the mozzarella that cheese ideal for a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.090
 good look this Neapolitan due to the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.209
 melting point that mozzarella has 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 melts in a way that perfect 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.060
 to be able to present it and gai well 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.060
 to the palate 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.640
 generally the Argentine we like the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.370
 meat but the Neapolitan Milanese already with 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.190
 ham cooked with mozzarella I think 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.440
 which is a mixture of pizza and planet and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 I think it's special for the environment 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.980
 this was the number 3 of 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.709
 favorite foods of Argentines that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.790
 They bring mozzarella and the Milanese to the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.360
 Neapolitan 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.760
 another dish that you owe 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.760
 actually to this famous who is now
