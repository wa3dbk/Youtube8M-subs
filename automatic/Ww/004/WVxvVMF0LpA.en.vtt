and<00:06:26.440> daddy<00:06:26.920> here<00:06:27.490> I'm<00:06:28.180> supposed<00:06:28.660> to<00:06:28.720> have<00:06:28.960> a

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
and daddy here I'm supposed to have a

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.610 
and daddy here I'm supposed to have a
flare<00:06:29.920> blitz<00:06:30.250> but<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:31.150> forgot<00:06:31.750> about<00:06:32.200> it<00:06:32.260> I

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
flare blitz but I forgot about it I

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.230 
flare blitz but I forgot about it I
guess<00:06:33.100> it<00:06:33.250> was<00:06:33.340> a<00:06:33.370> good<00:06:33.460> idea<00:06:33.640> because<00:06:33.940> if<00:06:34.120> I

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
guess it was a good idea because if I

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.480 
guess it was a good idea because if I
didn't<00:06:34.480> flare<00:06:34.660> blitz<00:06:34.900> right<00:06:35.230> now<00:06:35.350> I<00:06:35.590> would

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
didn't flare blitz right now I would

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.790 
didn't flare blitz right now I would
have<00:06:36.580> gone<00:06:36.760> to<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:37.030> really<00:06:37.780> low<00:06:38.020> HP<00:06:38.410> war<00:06:38.620> like<00:06:38.770> a
