00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.980
 the story is new and opens the way to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 a generation of new consoles 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 we wanted to start from scratch and that's what 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.940
 we did a lot of people expected that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.950
 let's do modern warfare &amp; 4 but in 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.289
 infinity ward we have invested in the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.179
 next generation in new technology 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 in ways of telling stories to people 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.589
 and the opportunity arose to create a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 new franchise for the victim as well 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.180
 that this is not based on black ops 2 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.920
 nor in modern warfare is a story 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 totally new with a set of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 new characters a new world and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 new technology that moves everything by 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 so this is what there is and the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.440
 history because something happens an event that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.469
 changed the geographical definition of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.930
 US changes the order and North America passes 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.649
 from being a superpower to a second 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.269
 great then you and your brother come to 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.489
 be part of a group called post 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.070
 one in charge of stopping the troops that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.050
 invade the country from the south this is what 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 that lay the foundations of the game you are a 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.830
 team throughout the entire game 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.299
 you work in a team in a way that does not 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.330
 has been seen before in the room call of 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.700
 duty 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.320
 sabotage missions of demolition and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.210
 much more stealth than you ever have 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.610
 seen in the tico series we also have 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.930
 a lot of action in the pack you have a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.970
 varied group of characters that 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.570
 interact with each other and we have this 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.160
 fan gallant winner of oscar portland ha 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.230
 come to write the story that you 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.840
 makes connect with the characters and makes 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.340
 fit the development dog do not you 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.530
 I'm going to tell you more about the story but 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.360
 yes that stands out together with the gameplay the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 technology and how to count the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.729
 things the graphics all that that we 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.800
 takes to another level for call of duty 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.690
 ghosts we have renewed the engine that 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.420
 responsible for the graphics of the animation 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.040
 the lighting system all this 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.040
 get us the call of duty 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.380
 what is best seen of all we have invested 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.330
 in it when is the level of detail of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.890
 the lights the textures if you've seen the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.110
 demo the scenes in the jungles 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.640
 underwater the nocturnal ones when you create 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.530
 a building or the water hits the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 crystal and many things that we have not yet 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.270
 shown all this takes you to another level 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.190
 we have achieved a level of detail 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.020
 superior to all the above we have 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.700
 awesome environments 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.740
 management in double joints 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.840
 in the face with what to see one 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.210
 talk in the game the level of detail and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 how emotions move all this 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.530
 makes it more convincing in this 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.540
 also influences stephen gaghan the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520
 traffic writer who transmits his 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.970
 inspiration through the characters and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.680
 situations this is achieved with 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.380
 graphics and animation but we have also 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.490
 improved the gameplay in what way 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.650
 we have got a new intelligence 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.660
 artificial and as an example I put the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.690
 dog introduce a game mechanic 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.910
 new is part of your squadron is 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 behaves according to the environment warns you 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.750
 if enemies detect the danger but 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.450
 you can also control it directly 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.490
 therefore we have some mechanics of 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.260
 new games and the prudent validity 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.510
 artificial enhanced that make a game 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.490
 public we have reviewed all the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 aspects and we have added the new 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.819
 technology they need with the goal 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.930
 to create the best with what you 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.930
 but nevertheless that medication
