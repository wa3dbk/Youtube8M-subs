00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.660
 while walking is the whole 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 Body weight of the foot bones 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 worn the natural damping 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 Function in the ankle ensures 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.049
 a relief in the knee and hip 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 the spine is transverse and longitudinal 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.680
 vaults descend with each step 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.949
 and are caused by the muscle tension 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.180
 rebuilt 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 The body weight will be mainly 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.560
 over the three points 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.219
 the verse the big toe joint and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 worn the little ten ground joint 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.730
 when cycling another force acts 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 on the foot bone as opposed to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.520
 therefore, can also on the damping zion 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.079
 of the foot are waived around one 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 healthy distribution of power on the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.460
 it's important to get the foot bones 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 to wear insoles while cycling 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 the cross and longitudinal vault optimally 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.410
 support and diffuse in turn 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.690
 To block 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.700
 without being insoles 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.350
 lower the arch of the foot while cycling 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.930
 and the foot would tire 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.250
 besides, the direct force on the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.200
 pedal will be diminished excessive 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 Movement of the foot in the rat shoe can 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.619
 further nerves and vessels 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 Coverings lead him 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.869
 tingling or expressing feelings of numbness 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.020
 on the basis of an analysis device 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.330
 determine that that too knee 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.330
 without a bad side moved harmful 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.560
 with a matching shoe sole it will be knee-length 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 stabilized and the harmful 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.050
 lateral movement is stopped 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.550
 according to the different foot 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.759
 types and special requirements 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.840
 when cycling, the company has aesculap 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.700
 The insole develops the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.130
 respective weak points of the foot 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 support 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.450
 These must be perfect on every foot types 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.140
 be adjusted 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:02.399
 You need a food is a foot 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.350
 reshape a pen and a pair of scissors 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.360
 It's up to you to determine the foot type 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
 Customer without shoes and in upright 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.730
 position it on the food disc 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.830
 for a clear thermal impression 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.150
 should get at least five 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.670
 seconds to be serviced 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.130
 Based on the resulting imprint is the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 footpath to recognize overall, it applies 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.129
 between the four different feet 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 differentiate between types 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.569
 the whole foods lowers the normal foot 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.569
 foot and the flat shot 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.110
 then the customer has to go to one of the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.330
 examined three existing forms 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.070
 he should be upright 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.020
 Position and legs together 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.450
 take is between the kneecaps 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.290
 enough space for two fingers 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 no before 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.820
 just who has a person because no 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.500
 space for two fingers remains and the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.870
 Create legs over the entire length 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.460
 should kneel together to hire 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.840
 and enough space for two fingers 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.250
 be between the ankles 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.250
 so lie nothing legs 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.480
 make a note of the number of the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 corresponding leg shape to the foot type 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.640
 and choose the football without the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.350
 correct type of insole by the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.970
 to calculator on the table is the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.200
 correct size based on the shoe size 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.670
 determined now must be the insole 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.100
 adapted to the shoe 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 the size of the previous insole 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.240
 can transfer directly to the new one 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.160
 be important is that the 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.700
 Overhead in the front area away 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.700
 is cut
