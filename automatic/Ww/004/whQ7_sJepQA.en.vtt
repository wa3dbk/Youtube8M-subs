00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.270
 a challenge even more not 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.090

 front I finished 20 profile wheels 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369

 we can see here he was demoted 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.649
 in relation to the hatchback version giving 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.199
 much more fluidity of the lines and make 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 a near perfect connection is to the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.800
 trunk of a versatile trunk

 enjoy the 450 liters that fit there 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.290
 inside is good to have room for everything and still 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 help of the lights the headlights light 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.810
 alone when it is necessary that the sensor 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:28.200
 parking avoid distractions 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 hd 20s and wears well who runs the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 series follows the tradition of 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 of the brand, the car has 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 Bid Monitoring panel is a panel 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.350

 they will light the whole time on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.860
 the need to turn on the light for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 this counts with all the commands in the

 conditioned with class function 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 what this is all about 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.500
 any kind of smell any kind of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.690
 may come from the accumulation of water 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.630

 best fit of the seats and in this 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.220
 segment other items weighing in favor

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 variable valve control that reduces 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
