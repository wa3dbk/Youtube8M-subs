00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.449

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.670
 I saw more videos later and later and more 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.470
 videos and keep watching more videos until 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 get to a song called panda bear 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 which was my total pleasure from there 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.130
 continue watching videos two more pandas 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.210

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.979

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 play of light by the body of the pig 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.210
