00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.959
 ie lecce did this trick today and 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.360
 I was inspired by a music video by 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.879
 beyoncÃ© that is called never liked me 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.699
 a lot in that video the trick that a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.070
 she is a little different in the sense that she 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.510
 water under a green eye shadow but not me 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.230
 liked anyway note they do with 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.430
 the green eyeshadow and I don't know I prefer 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.990
 blue because I think blue does the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 blue outline especially because it has the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.250
 brown eyes is much nicer because 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.069
 the brown companies stand out even more 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.210
 so I chose to do this trick 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.730
 today I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.469
 I leave you on the wheel and send you a kiss 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.089
 great hello 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.589
 while the first in progress on the whole 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.929
 but part after that I take this 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.210
 white knicks pencil and I put it 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.210
 only in the center of the eyelid 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.739
 now let's take this beautiful eye shadow 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:05.309
 blue is the time to put on 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 White 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.860
 with a white base so vivid colors 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.370
 present many more remain much 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.710
 the more important we take this now 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.690
 eye shadow which is a particular eye shadow 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 because it's a dark gray though 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.620
 Also inside the blue and this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 diva put in the inner corner 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.710
 of the eye will also put in the corner 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710
 external 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.000
 and a fold at this point I take this 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 beautiful rose and very slowly go 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.140
 blend it with the most 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.450
 now let's take this rose instead 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.210
 pink a little more barbie then lighter 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.210
 and this I must not put up here 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 please again the pencil and 3 course 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.230
 and I also take this beautiful blue 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.320
 very bright and I'm going to put it on 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.320
 dish 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.190
 to make this blue eyeshadow a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.000
 more clear and vibrant, the more you make choices 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:45.250
 I go with some nice white eyeshadow 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.489
 glittered to tap so you will see 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.170
 which immediately becomes clearer also 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.170
 it looks almost more metallic 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.330
 now as dominant below and eyebrow 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.000
 I'm going to get this eyeshadow this 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.900
 eyeshadow of but which is called vanilla e 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.090
 just hit I'm going to apply it to 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 apply it construct so I didn't have it 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.290
 mixed well colored 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:28.750
 for last thing in line with her and what 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.630
 make my damn hair the usual ones 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.420
 quarrels 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:40.370
 but this time I don't do it 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:42.710
 last minute simple tongue 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.750
 what the mascara so a lot 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.560
 black mascara is on the upper lashes 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.540
 more 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.540
 to issue the concealer under the eye 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.200
 but to put the illuminant and today use 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.720
 this is not rosy and more 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:15.120
 transparent and should also remain 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:19.320
 a little more delicate on the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:25.139
 cheeks and just that character not 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.970
 I like it a little bit like placid chuso 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.990
 this telematics is beautiful because 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.990
 this rose very very very bright 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.169
 like them 7 instead I put this one of pupa 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.689
 is called miss pupa the number 103 and is 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.360
 very very nice because it is a help 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.719
 very bright but not too light 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:05.659
 so don't go digging everything 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:07.460
 believe this is natural apple tree 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.500
 hence the final result of the trick 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.810
 so I hope you enjoyed them and 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.810
 I send a very big hello kiss
