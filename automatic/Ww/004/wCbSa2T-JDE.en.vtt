2<00:00:40.050> sort<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.829> shangri-la<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:42.149> that's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
2 sort of like shangri-la because that's

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.729 
2 sort of like shangri-la because that's
sort<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> pattern<00:00:43.379> they're

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
sort of what the pattern they're

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.459 
sort of what the pattern they're
following<00:00:44.190> since<00:00:44.969> die<00:00:45.300> rise<00:00:45.600> sort<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> seems

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
following since die rise sort of seems

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
following since die rise sort of seems
like<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> reefs<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.730> mama<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.780> deads

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
like the reefs and then mama the deads

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.049 
like the reefs and then mama the deads
like<00:00:49.410> Call<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> Dead<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.760> very

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
like Call of the Dead it's very very

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
like Call of the Dead it's very very
similar<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.930> hope<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> make<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
similar so I hope they just make it a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.240 
similar so I hope they just make it a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
pack that was considered fake was

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.960

insurgents now insurgents was definitely

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
insurgents now insurgents was definitely
the<00:01:18.030> most<00:01:18.150> believable<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> fakes

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the most believable of all the fakes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
the most believable of all the fakes
because<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.670> made<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.150> card<00:01:21.659> while

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

all the other ones were not made into a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600 
all the other ones were not made into a
card<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.540> were<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.840> images<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> also<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
picture or the leak for this was a very

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
picture or the leak for this was a very
clear<00:01:29.369> image<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> card<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.869> made<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
clear image of the card which made it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
clear image of the card which made it
more<00:01:31.259> believable<00:01:31.590> than<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.490> other<00:01:32.670> DLCs

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more believable than the other DLCs

more believable than the other DLCs
which<00:01:33.630> were<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:33.810> blurry<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> picture<00:01:35.700> and

for this one was called the Dark Side of
the<00:02:11.009> Moon<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.459> when<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> first<00:02:12.090> saw<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.660> was

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the Moon and when I first saw it I was

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.220 
the Moon and when I first saw it I was
like

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
like

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.710 
like
there's<00:02:13.349> no<00:02:13.620> way<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.610> real<00:02:14.909> because

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
there's no way that this is real because

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.539 
there's no way that this is real because
i<00:02:15.989> didn't<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.860> trick<00:02:17.250> would

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
i didn't think that trick would

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.550 
i didn't think that trick would
obviously<00:02:17.879> bring<00:02:18.330> us<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> moon<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
obviously bring us back to the moon and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.860 
obviously bring us back to the moon and
especially<00:02:20.220> name<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> map<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.209> dark<00:02:21.510> side<00:02:21.840> of

especially name the map the dark side of
the<00:02:22.019> moon<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.530> didn't<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.159> think<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.489> was

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the moon I didn't really think that was

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300 
the moon I didn't really think that was
real<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.239> also<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.780> image<00:02:25.170> was<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.650> moon<00:02:25.980> the

real and also the image was up moon the
map<00:02:26.549> which<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:28.019> didn't<00:02:28.319> believe<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.860> all

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
map which I just didn't believe at all

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.180 
map which I just didn't believe at all
now<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> third<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.540> called<00:02:30.900> salvation<00:02:31.349> no

salvation features the map amazon and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.940 
salvation features the map amazon and
amazon<00:02:35.690> definitely<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.620> good

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
amazon definitely would make a good

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.430 
amazon definitely would make a good
zombies<00:02:38.459> map<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.090> fall<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> pattern

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
zombies map and in fall in the pattern

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.319 
zombies map and in fall in the pattern
that<00:02:40.590> track<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.579> with<00:02:41.730> making<00:02:42.180> these

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
that track is going with making these

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.140 
that track is going with making these
deals<00:02:42.690> sees<00:02:43.140> what<00:02:43.620> made<00:02:43.890> amazon<00:02:44.640> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
deals sees what made amazon so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.539 
deals sees what made amazon so
believable<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.590> someone<00:02:47.099> took<00:02:47.489> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
believable was that someone took a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.940 
believable was that someone took a
picture<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.599> screenshot<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.379> call<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
picture of the screenshot of call of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.130 
picture of the screenshot of call of
duty<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.489> he<00:02:50.819> sort<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.540> switched<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.109> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
duty and he sort of switched up the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.650 
duty and he sort of switched up the
programming<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.370> showed<00:02:53.790> amazon<00:02:54.450> as

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
programming so it showed amazon as

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170 
programming so it showed amazon as
zombies<00:02:55.410> map<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.370> definitely<00:02:56.609> made<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
zombies map and it definitely made it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.259 
zombies map and it definitely made it
look<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.510> very<00:02:58.049> believable<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.640> honestly

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
look very very believable but honestly

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.349 
look very very believable but honestly
it<00:03:00.569> was<00:03:00.720> proved<00:03:01.410> fake<00:03:01.829> by<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> couple<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.849> people
