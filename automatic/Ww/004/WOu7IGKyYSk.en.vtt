00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
alright let's do some of that I think

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.809 
alright let's do some of that I think
we're<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.899> fifth<00:00:04.350> position<00:00:04.819> possibly

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
we're in the fifth position possibly

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.240 
we're in the fifth position possibly
fifty<00:00:06.629> six<00:00:06.990> seven<00:00:07.440> thousand<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.160> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
fifty six seven thousand out we're in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:18.349 
fifty six seven thousand out we're in
this<00:00:08.400> one<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.849> minor<00:00:09.360> pentatonic<00:00:17.060> again<00:00:18.060> that's

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
this one a minor pentatonic again that's

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:38.350 
this one a minor pentatonic again that's
12<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.289> 15<00:00:20.330> 12<00:00:21.330> 15<00:00:22.460> 12<00:00:23.460> 14<00:00:24.859> 12<00:00:25.859> 14<00:00:26.990> 13<00:00:27.990> 15<00:00:28.349> 12<00:00:29.390> 15

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.000 

so<00:00:39.360> let's<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> bend<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.500> 15

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.680 

so<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.130> going<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.280> bend<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.300> release

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so you're going to bend up and release

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.550 
so you're going to bend up and release
it<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.500> pull<00:00:46.739> off

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
it down and pull off

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.190 
it down and pull off
and<00:00:49.560> then<00:00:49.740> you're<00:00:49.830> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> bend<00:00:50.220> up<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> b

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
and then you're going to bend up the b

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.370 
and then you're going to bend up the b
15<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.630> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.810> catch<00:00:54.990> with<00:00:55.230> your

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
15 and you're going to catch with your

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:19.100 
15 and you're going to catch with your
pinky<00:00:56.810> 15th<00:00:57.810> fret<00:00:58.110> e<00:00:58.380> string<00:01:17.720> do<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> little

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
pinky 15th fret e string do a little

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.680 
pinky 15th fret e string do a little
kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.190> core<00:01:20.580> note<00:01:20.880> band<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.450> some

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
kind of a like a core note band on some

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:44.570 
kind of a like a core note band on some
of<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.170> instead<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.800> going

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.650 

ok<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:45.700> cheated<00:01:46.180> went<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.510> another

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
ok I just cheated went to another

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.500 
ok I just cheated went to another
position<00:01:46.900> but<00:01:47.380> let's<00:01:47.770> do<00:01:47.890> some<00:01:48.130> more<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:48.700> go

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.970 

so<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.690> one<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.020> we're<00:01:53.470> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.620> take<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
so that one is we're going to take the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.240 
so that one is we're going to take the
14th<00:01:54.400> fret<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.760> e<00:01:54.820> bend<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.480> up<00:01:55.920> half<00:01:56.920> step

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
14th fret of the e bend it up half step

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:14.300 
14th fret of the e bend it up half step
so<00:02:05.729> we're<00:02:06.729> going<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.910> bend<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.300> half<00:02:07.479> step

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.880 

I'm<00:02:15.310> grabbing<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.230> finger<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.800> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
I'm grabbing up with this finger at a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:31.460 
I'm grabbing up with this finger at a
high<00:02:18.040> heat<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:19.480> do<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.690> see<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.110> there

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:48.000 

one<00:02:32.470> more<00:02:32.650> time

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.839 

that's<00:02:49.010> all<00:02:49.189> I<00:02:49.219> know<00:02:49.340> they're<00:02:49.549> one<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.700> those

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
that's all I know they're one of those

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.339 
that's all I know they're one of those
bends<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.180> showed<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.599> in<00:02:50.750> another<00:02:50.959> video<00:02:51.170> but

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
bends I showed you in another video but

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.500 
bends I showed you in another video but
you're<00:02:51.560> bending<00:02:51.829> up<00:02:52.189> and<00:02:52.969> when<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.180> strings

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you're bending up and when the strings

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.970 
you're bending up and when the strings
crunched<00:02:53.959> together<00:02:54.079> you're<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.799> grab

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
crunched together you're going to grab

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:06.100 
crunched together you're going to grab
the<00:02:55.129> string<00:02:55.370> right<00:02:55.549> above<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.269> 14th

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:55.390 

uh

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.660 

so<00:03:56.400> those<00:03:56.519> are<00:03:56.549> just<00:03:56.790> some<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:58.670> different

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so those are just some of the different

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.459 
so those are just some of the different
bending<00:04:00.030> ideas<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.659> do<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.230> is

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
bending ideas you can do this this is

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.759 
bending ideas you can do this this is
when<00:04:02.099> you're<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.459> resolving<00:04:03.090> back<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.569> a

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.860 

because<00:04:07.769> you're<00:04:07.920> bending<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.430> G<00:04:09.209> note<00:04:09.420> up<00:04:09.629> to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
because you're bending this G note up to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.920 
because you're bending this G note up to
an<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.799> say<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.579> chord<00:04:11.790> progressions<00:04:12.269> like

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:25.430 

are<00:04:15.930> they<00:04:16.139> trickle<00:04:16.410> blues

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:45.010 

coming<00:04:25.950> back<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.310> eh

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:05:01.880 

freakin<00:04:46.020> uh<00:04:59.750> all<00:05:00.750> right<00:05:00.810> as<00:05:01.080> always<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.800> know

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
freakin uh all right as always you know

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.090 
freakin uh all right as always you know
work<00:05:02.100> on<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> vibrato<00:05:02.730> um<00:05:03.860> not<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:04.890> I'm

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
work on the vibrato um not that I'm

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.790 
work on the vibrato um not that I'm
endorsing<00:05:05.550> not<00:05:06.240> bending<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.110> pitch<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.770> if

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
endorsing not bending to pitch but if

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.110 
endorsing not bending to pitch but if
you<00:05:08.720> have<00:05:09.720> trouble<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.290> bending<00:05:10.530> back

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
you have trouble just bending back

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.280 
you have trouble just bending back
straight<00:05:12.120> up<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.600> pitch<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.080> note

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
straight up to the pitch of a note

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.350 
straight up to the pitch of a note
vibrato<00:05:14.070> helps<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.670> long<00:05:14.880> as<00:05:15.030> you're<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.240> the

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
vibrato helps as long as you're in the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.570 
vibrato helps as long as you're in the
ballpark<00:05:19.070> so<00:05:20.070> all<00:05:20.130> you're<00:05:20.310> doing<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.550> you're

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
ballpark so all you're doing is you're

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.719 
ballpark so all you're doing is you're
bending<00:05:20.820> up<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.060> whole<00:05:21.240> step

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.999 

and<00:05:24.729> going<00:05:25.090> down<00:05:25.389> and<00:05:25.449> coming<00:05:25.690> back<00:05:26.050> up<00:05:26.289> just<00:05:26.860> a

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
and going down and coming back up just a

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.510 
and going down and coming back up just a
little<00:05:27.190> bit<00:05:27.310> down<00:05:27.550> all<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:27.850> way<00:05:32.310> some<00:05:33.310> people

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
little bit down all the way some people

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.779 
little bit down all the way some people
have<00:05:33.610> real<00:05:33.849> wide<00:05:34.060> byrider<00:05:34.449> will<00:05:34.750> they<00:05:34.840> do<00:05:34.960> this

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
have real wide byrider will they do this

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.040 
have real wide byrider will they do this
or<00:05:36.789> you<00:05:37.539> know<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.810> real<00:05:37.960> fast<00:05:40.050> whatever

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
or you know the real fast whatever
