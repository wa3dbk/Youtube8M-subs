00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.000
 hi girls to the girls that just like 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 we are already back in minecraft os 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 I bring a new tutorial about the rest 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.420
 specifically how low the rest so 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.860
 vertical well as you all know the straight 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 does not have any problem when placed in 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.779
 horizontal but if we want to place it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 vertically the game does not leave us until 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 now when we wanted low flows 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.400
 vertical or down what we did 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.920
 it was either built a staircase 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.860
 or else we made a system based on 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.660
 repeater and dust powder 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.180
 repeater goes down going down 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 until the current was good to start 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.720
 of 1.5 thanks to the blocks of 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.770
 rest and a property of the pistons 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.809
 to be able to do it in a way 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.559
 different as you all know the pistons 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.300
 are able to push up to 12 blocks 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.570
 well imagine that we have this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.030
 here and we want to activate it with 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.220
 that lever up there would be a 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 little problem doing it either with the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 ladder or with this system because 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.860
 it would take us a long time just to do it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.810
 as follows we are going to dig 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.310
 two blocks one of two blocks of 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.900
 depth and another one of a block 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.790
 depth in the two blocks 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.159
 we put a piston looking up 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.020
 and next we put a comparator 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.760
 pointing towards him 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.850
 next we place a block of 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.729
 anything on top of him and on this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.909
 a block of rest now we only have left 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.300
 place a fence that goes up from that 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.300
 place 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.010
 to the place where we want 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.410
 be our source but remember not 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.470
 it can be between all can not be more 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.860
 of 12 blocks once we are up 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.990
 we put a seen looking down 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.420
 we plugged in the current there is and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.840
 ready and we have our system 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.300
 works the lady to the white and the piston 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760
 push the fences the fences push the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.710
 rest block and reston block 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.560
 comes into contact with the dust of the rest 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.710
 turning on the lamp we give it again 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 to the lever and the system returns to its 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.140
 position because that because of the comparator 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.930
 the comparator detects the current of the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.150
 block the rest and sends a signal to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.300
 this piston that at the time that one 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.800
 stop pushing pushes up on 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.650
 the moment the block of the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.420
 rest the piston the buyer returns to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.790
 send the signal to the piston telling it 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 there is no current then it returns to its 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.930
 original position allowing the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.030
 system can be used again 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.470
 from above in fact not only not 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.890
 It works with 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.640
 not only works with a lever if 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.280
 we want to also place a button 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.990
 it also works sends the pulse and in the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.090
 moment you stop sending the pulse 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.560
 returns to the original position this 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.210
 system I found it in the forums of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.070
 network and I found it so curious that I wanted to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.300
 share it with you I hope there is 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.320
 liked and nothing see you in the next 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.320
 video see you later
