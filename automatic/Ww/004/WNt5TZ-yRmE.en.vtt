00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.150
 collection alive today preparing for them 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.969
 vampire two french sweet toasts 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.570
 Slices of creamy bread with crispy 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.610
 caramel crust 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.829
 the only conditions in the house should be 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.720
 stale bread so cut it in advance 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.059
 the required amount of toast and leave 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.129
 they are dried for the night or send 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.680
 in the oven warmed up to one hundred one hundred ten 

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:32.250
 degrees for half an hour further everything is very 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 simply 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 egg beaten with sugar until full 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.130
 homogeneity i usually use 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.060
 brown sugar with them seems to me 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.060
 much tastier 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.940
 add dark rum it is not a paste 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.940
 seed or extract that there is 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.579
 finally add milk and heavy cream 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.739
 instead of the latter, you can simply add 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.730
 more milk but with cream all the same 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.680
 tastier 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.350
 the resulting mixture is poured into some 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.890
 wide but not too dishes I use 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.860
 baking dish 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.810
 and immerse there pieces of stale or 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.850
 dried bread they should not just 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.040
 soften feed yourself all this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 cream do not flax you mix keep them 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.940
 on one side and minute 3 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 turn over and a few more minutes on 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.390
 other 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.210
 Gleb should be well soaked and 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.210
 turn into such a creamy corner 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 frying pan heat up the butter 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.540
 when she sprinkles sprinkle it with sugar 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.540
 and put the pieces of bread in there 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.240
 now it is important not to burn fat well and 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.460
 not enough to fry too spoil 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.290
 the top should form a golden 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.390
 caramel crust as only one 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.180
 side will be ready sprinkle to a friend 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.340
 sugar and turn over now remains 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.140
 just wait for the pieces of bread and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.780
 from the second side will be rosy 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.290
 caramel each new portion you need 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.610
 fry on new butter 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.380
 ready what you can give quite a bit 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.450
 cool to get the caramel and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.100
 Serve on a plate can be powdered 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.830
 powdered sugar supplement fresh 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.080

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.210

 tried to urgently fix this error 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.010
 but you know these fat cause 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.230
 addictive they are so tasty 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.270
 that you can swallow the language detailed 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.620
