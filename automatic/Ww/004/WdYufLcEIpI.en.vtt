00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.910
 adding speakers can demonstrate 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.080
 what does it do and why is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 then with the push of a button whole 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 easily connect with all your 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.699
 devices with bluetooth if you have your laptop 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.310
 and you can instantly play all kinds of music 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.720
 stream 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 he it really does not require installation 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 so you can get started right away 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 your device has worked with this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.900
 device 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 and then you can enjoy all or and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.350
 online music libraries 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.270
 it's very easy like I just have 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 said you pair your smartphone with 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 Bluetooth on the device and with the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 also they output or with the top output 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.700
 you connect it to any kind 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.930
 speaker set he has that too 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.750
 and so you can do it easily 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.870
 enjoy your favorite music 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 for example this 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.789
 What is also very nice is that I have na 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.289
 my phone paired and with normal 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.879
 devices like this you can only do one 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.320
 device at the same time 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.299
 the good thing about this is that you have several 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.340
 devices can be connected to this box at the same time 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.630
 so that you have to transfer without 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.549
 switch with bluetooth connection 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.990
 just directly with another phone 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.369
 I have just added that of my colleague 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.720
 you can just do that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.619
 also link and that is not necessary 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.450
 another moment that can just be 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.009
 be linked at the same time 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.250
 and so you can get them right from other music 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.250
 to enjoy 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.819
 which is very handy when you are at home 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.100
 have multiple devices where multiple 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.659
 Music failures are on so you don't get any 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.369
 you can put blood on or off it to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.539
 change device 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.850
 please note that you are not equal 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.679
 music can only play music on 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.940
 listen to music on one device 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.470
 you also have to turn the music off before 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.310
 you can continue on the other device 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.110
 to go 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.490
 it has a range of 15 meters 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.289
 or site that means he's just in 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.729
 a radius of 15 meters with direct view 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.899
 can communicate with other devices 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.159
 with bluetooth 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.780
 Keep in mind that you are not through 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.890
 mineez can or on long distances 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.149
 listen 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.800
 the rest is in appearance 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.479
 naturally super compact and back 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.769
 is a nice LED light that is on 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.030
 if that connection is blinking 

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.739
 and to that bluetooth searching 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.879
 is top is a button you 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.269
 only whether it is too thick to connect 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.349
 to make 

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.269
 and for the rest they look at the back 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.920
 the connection just had to be over and over 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.360
 you can easily put it on your box or behind you 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.349
 put away books without bothering you 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.590
