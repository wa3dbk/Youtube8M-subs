can't die though because there are

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.279 
can't die though because there are
certain<00:01:28.180> puzzles<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.630> have<00:01:28.780> done<00:01:29.079> wrong

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
certain puzzles that have done wrong

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.859

there's<00:01:35.859> no<00:01:36.159> inventory<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.329> game<00:01:37.539> which

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
there's no inventory in this game which

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.539 
there's no inventory in this game which
is<00:01:38.020> actually<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> really<00:01:38.859> interesting<00:01:39.100> concept

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
is actually a really interesting concept

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.639 
is actually a really interesting concept
so<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.210> makes<00:01:40.359> it<00:01:40.479> where<00:01:40.630> every<00:01:41.079> puzzle<00:01:41.350> you

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
so it makes it where every puzzle you

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.560 
so it makes it where every puzzle you
solve<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.189> have<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.460> pick<00:01:42.700> up<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.090> one<00:01:43.270> piece

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
solve you have to pick up the one piece

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.209 
solve you have to pick up the one piece
and<00:01:43.899> carry<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.500> correct<00:01:44.979> solution

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
and carry it to the correct solution

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.580 
and carry it to the correct solution
there's<00:01:45.939> also<00:01:46.119> no<00:01:46.450> map<00:01:46.719> so<00:01:47.079> whenever<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.409> want

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
there's also no map so whenever you want

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.260 
there's also no map so whenever you want
to<00:01:47.649> find<00:01:47.920> something<00:01:48.219> or<00:01:48.520> solve<00:01:48.789> something

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
to find something or solve something

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.450 
to find something or solve something
it's<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.750> best<00:01:49.960> idea<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.500> write<00:01:50.770> down<00:01:51.009> clues

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
it's a best idea to write down clues

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's a best idea to write down clues
lots<00:01:52.149> of<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.450> puzzles<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:52.990> really

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
lots of the puzzles are really

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.830 
lots of the puzzles are really
devastatingly<00:01:54.070> hard<00:01:54.429> long<00:01:54.850> word<00:01:55.299> puzzles

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
devastatingly hard long word puzzles

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.569 
devastatingly hard long word puzzles
that<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.170> will<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.679> write<00:01:56.920> down<00:01:57.159> things

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
that you will want to write down things

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.919 
that you will want to write down things
that<00:01:57.700> you're<00:01:57.939> actually<00:01:58.270> gonna<00:01:58.390> have<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.689> map

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
that you're actually gonna have to map

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.779 
that you're actually gonna have to map
out<00:01:59.140> one<00:01:59.469> of<00:01:59.560> them's<00:01:59.740> even<00:02:00.070> an<00:02:00.130> algebra

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
out one of them's even an algebra

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.760 
out one of them's even an algebra
equation<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:02.049> if<00:02:02.259> you're<00:02:02.439> one<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.649> those

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
equation so if you're one of those

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.319 
equation so if you're one of those
people<00:02:02.979> who<00:02:03.249> are<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.549> me<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:03.939> I'm<00:02:04.060> never
