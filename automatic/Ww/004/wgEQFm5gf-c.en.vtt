well hello guys and welcome to the first
advanced<00:00:03.240> tutorial<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.899> creating<00:00:04.110> life<00:00:04.470> so

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
advanced tutorial on creating life so

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.150 
advanced tutorial on creating life so
today<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.629> go<00:00:07.049> through<00:00:07.319> color

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
today we're going to go through color

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790 
today we're going to go through color
correcting<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.990> we're<00:00:09.990> going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> create<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
correcting and we're going to create a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.799 
correcting and we're going to create a
film<00:00:11.070> look<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.360> which<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
film look on a video which I'm going to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.390 
film look on a video which I'm going to
show<00:00:12.900> right<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.860> we'll<00:00:13.980> import<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
show right now so we'll import that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.279 
show right now so we'll import that
video<00:00:14.700> here<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.430> open<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.869> it<00:00:18.869> says<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
video here it is open it up it says it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.660 
video here it is open it up it says it
doesn't<00:00:19.590> match<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> projectiles<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
doesn't match the projectiles with that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.849 
doesn't match the projectiles with that
doesn't<00:00:21.000> matter<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.080> drag<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
doesn't matter we will drag down to the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.210 
doesn't matter we will drag down to the
timeline<00:00:23.210> actually<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
timeline actually you can see it's a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220 
timeline actually you can see it's a
video<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> street<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.630> class<00:00:27.840> moving

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
video of a street with some class moving

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
video of a street with some class moving
and<00:00:28.439> you're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.699> film<00:00:30.240> effect<00:00:30.660> on

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and you're going to get a film effect on

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.200 
and you're going to get a film effect on
this<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.380> we'll<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.250> effects<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
this so we'll need some effects first of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
this so we'll need some effects first of
them<00:00:33.360> has<00:00:33.540> letterboxing<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
them has letterboxing so you can just

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.830 
them has letterboxing so you can just
type<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> search<00:00:35.880> box<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
type it in the search box over here and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.990 
type it in the search box over here and
then<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.170> letterboxing<00:00:39.050> if<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:41.000> 400

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
then get letterboxing if you see 400

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.630 
then get letterboxing if you see 400
pixels<00:00:42.390> means<00:00:42.600> 200<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.260> both<00:00:43.980> sides<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> top

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pixels means 200 on both sides and top

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
pixels means 200 on both sides and top
and<00:00:44.670> bottom<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.510> too<00:00:45.809> much<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> we'll

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and bottom so that's too much so we'll

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
and bottom so that's too much so we'll
decrease<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.910> 200<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:51.000> looks<00:00:51.239> good

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
decrease it to about 200 that looks good

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
decrease it to about 200 that looks good
enough<00:00:51.809> well<00:00:52.230> letterboxing<00:00:52.829> isn't<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
enough well letterboxing isn't that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.479 
enough well letterboxing isn't that
important<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.260> highlights<00:00:55.489> what

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
important but it kind of highlights what

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
important but it kind of highlights what
you<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> show<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.420> central<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you want to show like central the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.970 
you want to show like central the
fast-moving<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> people<00:01:00.829> going<00:01:01.829> out

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
fast-moving and not the people going out

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.600 
fast-moving and not the people going out
of<00:01:02.129> footpaths<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.030> something<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.580> helps<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of footpaths or something so it helps to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
of footpaths or something so it helps to
keep<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> audience<00:01:06.470> hooked<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
keep the audience hooked to what you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.179 
keep the audience hooked to what you
want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> show<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
want to show them so that's good and

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
want to show them so that's good and
we'll<00:01:11.189> need<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.580> saturation<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
we'll need a saturation because the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.359 
we'll need a saturation because the
colors<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.830> dull<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
colors are pretty dull over here and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.340 
colors are pretty dull over here and
also<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> contrast<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:21.320> oopsy<00:01:22.820> contrast<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
also the contrast and oopsy contrast and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
also the contrast and oopsy contrast and
the<00:01:25.350> vignette<00:01:25.740> effect<00:01:26.659> vignette<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.380> we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the vignette effect vignette what do we

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.490 
the vignette effect vignette what do we
call<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
call it

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
call it
so<00:01:31.500> we'll<00:01:31.800> add<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:31.980> to<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:34.760> even<00:01:35.760> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so we'll add that to so even the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.900 
so we'll add that to so even the
vignette<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.480> not<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.410> important<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.070> even

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
vignette is not that important see even

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.490 
vignette is not that important see even
that's<00:01:39.120> for<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> same<00:01:39.510> purpose<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.110> letter

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that's for the same purpose as a letter

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
that's for the same purpose as a letter
boxing<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:42.120> draws<00:01:42.630> attention<00:01:42.870> towards

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
boxing so it draws attention towards

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
boxing so it draws attention towards
some<00:01:43.740> street<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> cars<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
some street and the cars and not the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
some street and the cars and not the
random<00:01:45.540> people<00:01:45.810> walking<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
random people walking on see it so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.570 
random people walking on see it so
that's<00:01:47.850> why<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.380> didn't<00:01:49.380> add<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.830> might<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
that's why I didn't add you might you

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.370 
that's why I didn't add you might you
will<00:01:50.760> need<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.150> curves<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:53.930> let's<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
will need the curves and let's see I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.850 
will need the curves and let's see I
think<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.670> thought<00:01:56.820> almost<00:01:57.150> all<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> need

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
think you thought almost all you need

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.650 
think you thought almost all you need
the<00:01:58.860> other<00:01:58.920> thing<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> might<00:01:59.580> need<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
the other thing you might need is the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.600 
the other thing you might need is the
hue<00:02:00.900> but<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.040> you'll<00:02:02.220> need<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
hue but I don't think you'll need that

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.080 
hue but I don't think you'll need that
so<00:02:02.850> we'll<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.330> gonna<00:02:03.570> add<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.940> we<00:02:05.940> go

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so we'll not gonna add that so we go

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.520 
so we'll not gonna add that so we go
saturation<00:02:07.070> will<00:02:08.070> take<00:02:08.340> saturation<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.209> bit

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
saturation will take saturation up a bit

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.910 
saturation will take saturation up a bit
maybe<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:11.270> yeah<00:02:12.440> well<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> color<00:02:13.739> should

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
maybe some yeah well the color should

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.540 
maybe some yeah well the color should
look<00:02:14.070> good<00:02:14.480> we'll<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.720> make<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.020> 200<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.400> make

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
look good we'll just make it 200 to make

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.820 
look good we'll just make it 200 to make
that<00:02:17.760> exact<00:02:18.150> trigger<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.320> that's<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.800> enough

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that exact trigger so that's good enough

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.449 
that exact trigger so that's good enough
for<00:02:20.900> will<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.050> go<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> contest<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.160> raise

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
for will you go to the contest and raise

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.330 
for will you go to the contest and raise
the<00:02:23.610> contrast<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.420> too

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.550 

that's<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.610> bit<00:02:29.970> too<00:02:30.239> much<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.260> I'm<00:02:31.440> not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that's just bit too much but I'm not

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.400 
that's just bit too much but I'm not
going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.160> try<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.390> we'll<00:02:33.540> go<00:02:33.750> back<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
going to try now so we'll go back to the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.160 
going to try now so we'll go back to the
vignette<00:02:34.769> effect<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.720> we'll<00:02:36.720> add<00:02:36.840> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
vignette effect and we'll add that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.490 
vignette effect and we'll add that
so<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.890> got<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.700> concentrated<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.690> today<00:02:39.989> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
so we got it concentrated on today this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
so we got it concentrated on today this
looks<00:02:40.769> pretty<00:02:40.920> good<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.870> films

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
looks pretty good but a lot of the films

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.199 
looks pretty good but a lot of the films
well<00:02:43.620> different<00:02:44.130> films<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.610> have<00:02:44.820> different

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
well different films do have different

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.640 
well different films do have different
effects<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
effects like if you see in the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.710 
effects like if you see in the
Terminator<00:02:47.070> series<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.790> they<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> lot

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
Terminator series that they have a lot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.250 
Terminator series that they have a lot
of<00:02:48.750> orange<00:02:49.140> tint<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> video<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.269> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
of orange tint to the video so that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.860 
of orange tint to the video so that
looks<00:02:52.470> good<00:02:52.739> for<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.790> highways<00:02:54.209> which<00:02:54.750> they

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
looks good for the highways which they

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
looks good for the highways which they
only<00:02:55.019> show<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.650> most<00:02:56.130> films<00:02:56.489> do<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:56.880> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
only show so most films do have a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.720 
only show so most films do have a
reddish<00:02:57.299> tint<00:02:57.600> oh<00:02:57.750> yeah<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.530> that's<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.130> what

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
reddish tint oh yeah so that's one what

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.150 
reddish tint oh yeah so that's one what
we<00:02:59.970> are<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> add<00:03:00.420> here<00:03:00.840> I'll<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
we are going to add here I'll go to the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.289 
we are going to add here I'll go to the
curse<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.360> red<00:03:04.049> selector<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.180> press<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
curse and see a red selector I press the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.289 
curse and see a red selector I press the
middle<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.459> raise<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> mid-tones

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
middle of it and raise up the mid-tones

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.900 
middle of it and raise up the mid-tones
of<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.459> not<00:03:11.459> yet<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.570> fine-tuning<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> bit

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
of it not yet just fine-tuning it a bit

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.930 
of it not yet just fine-tuning it a bit
a<00:03:15.320> bit<00:03:16.320> more<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.800> think<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:20.400> looks<00:03:20.610> good

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
a bit more I think and that looks good

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.910 
a bit more I think and that looks good
enough<00:03:21.320> personal<00:03:22.320> effect<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.920> walk

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
enough personal effect you can walk

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.630 
enough personal effect you can walk
around<00:03:26.160> with<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.490> contrast<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.930> get

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
around with the contrast to get

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.850 
around with the contrast to get
something<00:03:29.640> different<00:03:29.880> than<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.860> saw

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
something different than what you saw

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.240 
something different than what you saw
right<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.120> make<00:03:33.420> three<00:03:33.720> twenty<00:03:34.200> five<00:03:34.590> to

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
right now so make three twenty five to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
right now so make three twenty five to
twenty<00:03:35.520> four<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.480> looks<00:03:36.720> good<00:03:36.930> enough

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
twenty four and that looks good enough

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.160 
twenty four and that looks good enough
so<00:03:38.100> that's<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.450> easy<00:03:39.720> right

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
so that's it that is easy right

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.590 
so that's it that is easy right
and<00:03:40.370> that's<00:03:41.370> how<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.550> create<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.940> film<00:03:42.270> effect

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
and that's how you create a film effect

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.880 
and that's how you create a film effect
in<00:03:42.840> Caden<00:03:43.410> life

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
in Caden life
