beats cake I like this kid right off the
bat<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.160> definitely<00:00:38.640> question

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
bat I don't like definitely question

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
bat I don't like definitely question
that<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.809> sound<00:00:40.559> except<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that one sound except in the in the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
that one sound except in the in the
bracket<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.629> underneath<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.320> chicken

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bracket right underneath is chicken

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
bracket right underneath is chicken
versus<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> slurpee<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.420> chicken<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.870> already

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
versus a slurpee now chicken is already

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
versus a slurpee now chicken is already
at<00:00:46.289> chick-fil-a<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.340> flawed<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> believe

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
at chick-fil-a so it's flawed I believe

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.119 
at chick-fil-a so it's flawed I believe
there<00:00:48.600> how<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.020> chicken<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.559> chick-fil-a<00:00:49.770> be

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
there how can chicken and chick-fil-a be

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
there how can chicken and chick-fil-a be
in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> same<00:00:50.550> region<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.210> slurpee<00:00:51.719> beats

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
in the same region so slurpee beats

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
in the same region so slurpee beats
chicken<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.680> Slurpee<00:00:53.160> beats

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
chicken and then Slurpee beats

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
chicken and then Slurpee beats
chick-fil-a<00:00:54.149> yeah<00:00:54.510> slurpee<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> way

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
chick-fil-a yeah slurpee is all the way

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
chick-fil-a yeah slurpee is all the way
to<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> final<00:00:56.610> four<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.690> bracket<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.170> me

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.600 
we may be the final four I mean it's
somehow<00:03:21.290> brownies<00:03:21.740> beats<00:03:21.950> pretzels<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.430> think

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
somehow brownies beats pretzels I think

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.030 
somehow brownies beats pretzels I think
that's<00:03:22.730> obvious<00:03:23.080> Pizza<00:03:24.080> beats<00:03:24.290> slurpees<00:03:24.830> to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
that's obvious Pizza beats slurpees to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.160 
that's obvious Pizza beats slurpees to
me<00:03:25.190> also<00:03:25.700> obvious<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.420> final<00:03:26.750> four<00:03:26.930> not

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
me also obvious so that final four not

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.230 
me also obvious so that final four not
exciting<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.830> me<00:03:27.980> not<00:03:28.130> those<00:03:28.400> battles<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
exciting to me not those battles the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.790 
exciting to me not those battles the
tough<00:03:29.510> battle<00:03:29.660> has<00:03:29.900> already<00:03:29.930> been<00:03:30.170> won<00:03:30.290> yeah

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
tough battle has already been won yeah

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.860 
tough battle has already been won yeah
and<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.430> pizza<00:03:31.670> beats<00:03:31.970> brownies<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.600> become

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and then pizza beats brownies to become

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.590 
and then pizza beats brownies to become
the<00:03:32.950> dinner<00:03:33.950> selection<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.730> guess<00:03:34.880> yeah<00:03:35.060> would

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
the dinner selection I guess yeah would

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.900 
the dinner selection I guess yeah would
you<00:03:35.750> say<00:03:36.020> now<00:03:36.290> again<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.580> not<00:03:37.730> an

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
you say now again and this is not an

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.510 
you say now again and this is not an
awkward<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.480> me<00:03:38.710> brownies<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.980> don't<00:03:40.250> know<00:03:40.400> if

brownies that's why I would have rather

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.540 
brownies that's why I would have rather
seen<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.750> spaghetti<00:03:57.320> or<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> hamburgers<00:03:58.310> there

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.150 
seen a spaghetti or a hamburgers there
in<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.850> final<00:03:59.210> game<00:03:59.390> Pat<00:03:59.660> but<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.710> pizza

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
in the final game Pat but it pizza

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.620 
in the final game Pat but it pizza
brownies<00:04:01.520> of<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.700> way<00:04:01.820> it<00:04:01.970> broke<00:04:02.150> out<00:04:02.360> and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
brownies of the way it broke out and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.510 
brownies of the way it broke out and
pizza<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.020> think<00:04:03.260> with<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.380> fairly<00:04:03.830> easy<00:04:04.010> victory

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520
