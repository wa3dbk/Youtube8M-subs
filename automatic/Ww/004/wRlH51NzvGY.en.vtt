00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
waterproof up to 6.6 feet which we're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
waterproof up to 6.6 feet which we're
trying<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> test<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.960> don't<00:00:49.289> know

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
trying to test right now I don't know

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
trying to test right now I don't know
how<00:00:49.739> successful<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.370> six<00:00:50.579> point<00:00:50.789> six<00:00:50.969> foot

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
how successful this six point six foot

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
how successful this six point six foot
test<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.559> sex<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:52.890> sex

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
test is because that's not sex more sex

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
test is because that's not sex more sex
be<00:00:53.250> worth<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.610> water<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.480> could<00:00:54.629> drop<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
be worth of water and you could drop it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.709 
be worth of water and you could drop it
from<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> height<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.500> 6.6<00:00:56.309> feet<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from a height of 6.6 feet so this is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
from a height of 6.6 feet so this is
basically<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.559> lifeproof<00:00:59.039> fre<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> giant

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
basically a lifeproof fre with a giant

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
basically a lifeproof fre with a giant
battery<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
battery on the back of it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.630 
battery on the back of it
lifeproof<00:01:01.710> tells<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> pre<00:01:02.460> water

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
lifeproof tells you to do the pre water

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
lifeproof tells you to do the pre water
test<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.090> we've<00:01:03.239> already<00:01:03.420> done<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> our

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
test which we've already done in our

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
test which we've already done in our
kitchen<00:01:04.589> sink<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.250> thing<00:01:05.489> passed<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:06.030> took<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
kitchen sink the thing passed we took it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
kitchen sink the thing passed we took it
apart<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:06.900> nothing<00:01:07.260> wrong<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
apart there's nothing wrong with the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
apart there's nothing wrong with the
case<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:08.520> iPhone<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> we're

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
case we put our iPhone in it and we're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
case we put our iPhone in it and we're
just<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
just about to take out to see well if I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
just about to take out to see well if I
still<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:12.750> iPhone<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.380> here's<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> unit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
still have an iPhone so here's the unit

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
still have an iPhone so here's the unit
we've<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> headphone<00:01:15.210> jack<00:01:15.240> extension

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
we've got the headphone jack extension

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.480 
we've got the headphone jack extension
installed<00:01:16.380> into<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> nice<00:01:17.250> things

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
installed into it one of the nice things

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020 
installed into it one of the nice things
about<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:18.000> cases<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.030> headphone

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
about these cases is that the headphone

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
about these cases is that the headphone
jack<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> threaded<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> definitely<00:01:23.369> keeps

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
jack is threaded so it definitely keeps

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
jack is threaded so it definitely keeps
the<00:01:23.700> water<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.000> even<00:01:24.840> better<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the water out even better than just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
the water out even better than just
other<00:01:26.130> cases<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.939> plug<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
other cases where you just plug it in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.520 
other cases where you just plug it in
the<00:01:28.820> port<00:01:29.820> looks<00:01:29.939> pretty<00:01:30.450> clear<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> think

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the port looks pretty clear at and think

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
the port looks pretty clear at and think
I<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:32.009> water<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.490> there

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I see any water in there

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
I see any water in there
I'll<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> front<00:01:34.860> panel<00:01:35.369> now

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I'll just take off the front panel now

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.039 
I'll just take off the front panel now
there<00:01:36.090> might<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> chance<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.689> water's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there might be a chance that water's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
there might be a chance that water's
going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> splash<00:01:37.560> into<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.430> middle<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
going to splash into the middle of the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
going to splash into the middle of the
case<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.720> there's<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.350> water<00:01:40.560> in

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
case because there's gonna be water in

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
case because there's gonna be water in
these<00:01:41.220> edges<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> outside<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
these edges it's on the outside of the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
these edges it's on the outside of the
case<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.790> might<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:45.420> as

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
case but there's there might be water as

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.539 
case but there's there might be water as
you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.100> see<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.820> let's

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
you can see a little bit there let's

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.260 
you can see a little bit there let's
crack<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> open

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.420 

so<00:01:59.270> there's<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.600> bit<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.920> battering<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.219> I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
so there's a bit of battering but I

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.029 
so there's a bit of battering but I
don't<00:02:01.610> think<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.119> an<00:02:02.509> issue<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.530> if<00:02:03.920> we

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
don't think that's an issue and if we

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.370 
don't think that's an issue and if we
take<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.399> out<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.360> back<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.929> case<00:02:06.140> is

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
take it out the back of the case is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.119 
take it out the back of the case is
completely<00:02:06.860> clear<00:02:07.599> there's<00:02:08.599> nothing<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
completely clear there's nothing in the

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.430 
completely clear there's nothing in the
headphone<00:02:10.550> jack<00:02:10.580> area<00:02:11.269> there's<00:02:12.019> nothing<00:02:12.319> on

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
headphone jack area there's nothing on

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.000 
headphone jack area there's nothing on
the<00:02:12.530> inside<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:14.120> seal<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.650> back<00:02:15.830> is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
the inside of the seal the back is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the inside of the seal the back is
completely<00:02:16.130> dry<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:18.200> iPhone<00:02:18.620> back<00:02:19.060> is

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
completely dry the iPhone back is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
completely dry the iPhone back is
completely<00:02:23.030> dry<00:02:23.269> as<00:02:23.450> well<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.049> shouldn't<00:02:24.799> be

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
completely dry as well so shouldn't be

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.729 
completely dry as well so shouldn't be
any<00:02:25.040> issues<00:02:25.459> there<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.200> o-rings<00:02:27.590> are

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
any issues there the the o-rings are

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.050 
any issues there the the o-rings are
pretty<00:02:27.920> clear<00:02:28.220> as<00:02:28.370> well<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.790> that's<00:02:28.849> really

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pretty clear as well and that's really

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150 
pretty clear as well and that's really
the<00:02:29.510> only<00:02:29.540> fault<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:30.769> find<00:02:31.010> with

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the only fault that you can find with

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.710 
the only fault that you can find with
these<00:02:31.310> cases<00:02:31.519> there's<00:02:32.090> some<00:02:32.239> debris<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.599> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
these cases there's some debris on the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.850 
these cases there's some debris on the
o-rings<00:02:33.110> your<00:02:33.260> case<00:02:33.440> isn't<00:02:33.620> gonna<00:02:33.769> be

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
o-rings your case isn't gonna be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.920 
o-rings your case isn't gonna be
waterproof<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.329> be<00:02:35.450> aware<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.780> that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
waterproof so just be aware that that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.680 
waterproof so just be aware that that
could<00:02:36.290> happen<00:02:36.819> let's<00:02:37.819> go<00:02:37.970> drop<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.329> from<00:02:38.450> six

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
could happen let's go drop it from six

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.539 
could happen let's go drop it from six
feet<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.440> before<00:02:39.709> we<00:02:39.799> do<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.069> drop<00:02:40.220> test<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.489> do

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
feet so before we do this drop test I do

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.370 
feet so before we do this drop test I do

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the iPhone 6 from this angle we actually

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.009 
the iPhone 6 from this angle we actually
crack<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.790> case<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> first<00:02:56.660> thing<00:02:56.840> we're

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
crack the case so the first thing we're

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.440 
crack the case so the first thing we're
going<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.319> do<00:02:57.579> of<00:02:58.579> course<00:02:58.849> drop<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.209> from<00:02:59.299> this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
going to do of course drop it from this

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.490 
going to do of course drop it from this
angle

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.940 

case<00:03:06.500> looks<00:03:06.829> good<00:03:07.700> oh<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:09.200> did<00:03:09.350> come<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.680> parts

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
case looks good oh it did come up parts

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.830 
case looks good oh it did come up parts
a<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.310> bit's<00:03:10.459> let's<00:03:11.150> snap<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.450> back<00:03:11.600> in

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
a little bit's let's snap it back in

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.470 
a little bit's let's snap it back in
maybe<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.200> was<00:03:12.639> my<00:03:13.639> own<00:03:13.790> fault<00:03:14.060> for<00:03:14.329> not

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
maybe that was my own fault for not

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.180 
maybe that was my own fault for not
making<00:03:15.049> sure<00:03:15.319> everything<00:03:15.620> was<00:03:15.739> installed<00:03:16.069> if

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
making sure everything was installed if

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.879 
making sure everything was installed if
dropping<00:03:16.489> one<00:03:16.609> more<00:03:16.730> time<00:03:17.049> I'm<00:03:18.049> 5/8<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.739> is

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
dropping one more time I'm 5/8 this is

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:26.800 
dropping one more time I'm 5/8 this is
about<00:03:19.069> 6<00:03:19.370> feet<00:03:24.639> yeah<00:03:25.639> everything<00:03:26.299> stuck

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
about 6 feet yeah everything stuck

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.830 
about 6 feet yeah everything stuck
together<00:03:27.340> definitely<00:03:28.340> some<00:03:28.519> scuffing<00:03:29.090> one

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
together definitely some scuffing one

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.660 
together definitely some scuffing one
more<00:03:29.959> time

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
more time

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.390 
more time
that<00:03:31.670> was<00:03:31.760> face<00:03:31.970> first<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.650> face<00:03:36.829> first<00:03:37.100> drop

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
that was face first so face first drop

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000 
that was face first so face first drop
not<00:03:38.150> an<00:03:38.359> issue<00:03:38.510> let's<00:03:39.170> do<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.349> close-up<00:03:39.650> real

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
not an issue let's do a close-up real

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.309 
not an issue let's do a close-up real
quick<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.730> as<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.180> can<00:03:41.299> tell<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.989> where

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
quick so as you can tell that is where

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.069 
quick so as you can tell that is where
the<00:03:42.819> most<00:03:43.819> scuffed<00:03:44.120> up<00:03:44.239> part<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.660> cases

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
the most scuffed up part of the cases

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.199 
the most scuffed up part of the cases
that's<00:03:45.260> not<00:03:45.349> terribly<00:03:45.920> great

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
that's not terribly great

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.759 
that's not terribly great
but<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.510> ground<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.049> dropped<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.470> on<00:03:48.590> is

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
but the ground that we dropped it on is

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.949 
but the ground that we dropped it on is
brick<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.670> not<00:03:49.849> terribly<00:03:50.269> smooth<00:03:50.630> so

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
brick so it's not terribly smooth so

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.670 
brick so it's not terribly smooth so
kind<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.889> expected<00:03:52.700> all<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.299> all<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:54.410> case<00:03:54.650> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
kind of expected all in all the case a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.559 
kind of expected all in all the case a
little<00:03:55.099> bit<00:03:55.220> more<00:03:55.489> scuff<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:55.880> there<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:56.510> not

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
little bit more scuff in there I'm not

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.270 
little bit more scuff in there I'm not
too<00:03:56.840> concerned<00:03:57.230> about<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:58.669> case<00:03:58.880> let's<00:04:00.280> take

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
too concerned about the case let's take

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.270 
too concerned about the case let's take
the<00:04:01.430> iPhone<00:04:01.609> out<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.150> see<00:04:02.389> if<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:02.750> bent

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
the iPhone out and see if it's bent

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.470 
the iPhone out and see if it's bent
because<00:04:04.280> that's<00:04:04.489> our<00:04:04.640> favorite<00:04:04.849> thing<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.329> do

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
because that's our favorite thing to do

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.630 
because that's our favorite thing to do
with<00:04:05.870> iPhones<00:04:06.290> is<00:04:06.439> to<00:04:06.590> bend<00:04:06.799> them<00:04:06.950> apparently

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
with iPhones is to bend them apparently

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.560 
with iPhones is to bend them apparently
the<00:04:08.640> iPhone<00:04:08.940> sits<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.360> cradle<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.870> looks

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
the iPhone sits in the cradle it looks

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.569 
the iPhone sits in the cradle it looks
pretty<00:04:12.570> straight<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:16.260> know<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.530> front<00:04:16.739> face

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
pretty straight you know the front face

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.560 
pretty straight you know the front face
first<00:04:17.940> drop<00:04:18.390> didn't<00:04:19.320> seem<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.970> do<00:04:20.970> anything<00:04:21.390> to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
first drop didn't seem to do anything to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.850 
first drop didn't seem to do anything to
it<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.830> glass<00:04:23.070> pane<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.580> still<00:04:24.230> on<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.440> iPhone

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
it the glass pane is still on the iPhone

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.060 
it the glass pane is still on the iPhone
so<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.370> don't<00:04:27.330> know<00:04:27.420> all<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.410> all<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:28.740> it's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
so I don't know all in all I think it's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.300 
so I don't know all in all I think it's
a<00:04:29.610> pretty<00:04:30.240> decent<00:04:30.630> battery<00:04:30.810> tough<00:04:31.290> case<00:04:31.590> so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
a pretty decent battery tough case so

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.920 
a pretty decent battery tough case so
that's<00:04:32.490> all<00:04:32.640> we<00:04:32.790> got<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.330> free<00:04:33.600> power

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
that's all we got for the free power

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.520 
that's all we got for the free power
case<00:04:34.500> for<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.490> iPhone<00:04:35.850> 6<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.140> really

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
case for the iPhone 6 this is a really

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.220 
case for the iPhone 6 this is a really
expensive<00:04:37.830> case<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.430> 130<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.120> 130<00:04:39.930> US

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
expensive case this is 130 to 130 US

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.640 
expensive case this is 130 to 130 US
dollars<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:41.030> again<00:04:42.030> definitely<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:43.140> do<00:04:43.200> think

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
dollars so again definitely I do think

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.980
