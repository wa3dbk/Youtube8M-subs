00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
ligature so let's start with this what

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
ligature so let's start with this what
are<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> basic<00:01:26.460> pieces<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.939> areas<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
are the basic pieces of areas of a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
are the basic pieces of areas of a
mouthpiece<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.320> tip<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:30.060> call<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
mouthpiece the tip we call this the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
mouthpiece the tip we call this the
plate<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.710> depends<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.070> who<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> talk<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> what

this call is called several different
things<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.409> call<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> plate<00:01:35.070> because<00:01:36.030> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
things I call it the plate because it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
things I call it the plate because it's
the<00:01:36.329> nice<00:01:36.479> flat<00:01:36.930> piece<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the nice flat piece that you're going to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.999 
the nice flat piece that you're going to
cook<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.430> read<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.680> tell<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
cook your read on and you can tell that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.060 
cook your read on and you can tell that
they<00:01:41.159> match<00:01:41.400> perfectly<00:01:42.590> from<00:01:43.590> side<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.890> side

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
they match perfectly from side to side

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.289 
they match perfectly from side to side
so<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> position<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.869> Reed<00:01:46.110> that's

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299

so how do you position your Reed that's
that's<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> first<00:01:48.869> step<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> what

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that's really the first step and what

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's really the first step and what
you<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.570> up

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you want to do is if you look right up

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
you want to do is if you look right up
here<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.290> sure<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.830 
too well is you want to slide this Reed
up<00:01:56.070> until<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.750> hair<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.560> black

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
up until you see just a hair of black

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
up until you see just a hair of black
just<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> hair<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.770> black<00:02:02.040> coming<00:02:02.490> over<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> top

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
just a hair of black coming over the top

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
just a hair of black coming over the top
and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.110> should<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.409> lined<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.860> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and then this should be lined up with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.560 
and then this should be lined up with
the<00:02:05.130> plate<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.670> left<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.299> should<00:02:06.479> be

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the plate so left and right it should be

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
the plate so left and right it should be
centered<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> put<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.280> ligature

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
centered and then you put your ligature

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
centered and then you put your ligature
on<00:02:08.819> ligature<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.840> there<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.020> several

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
on ligature on and there are several

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.260 
on ligature on and there are several
different<00:02:10.470> types<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.099> ligatures<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.580> maybe

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
different types of ligatures and maybe

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
different types of ligatures and maybe
I'm<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.540> pause<00:02:12.690> real<00:02:12.989> quick<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.319> show

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'm going to pause real quick and show

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.960 
I'm going to pause real quick and show
you<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> different<00:02:14.220> types<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.549> ligatures

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
you all the different types of ligatures

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.369 
you all the different types of ligatures
that<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> might<00:02:15.360> run<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.140> let's<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
that you might run into so let's do a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.310 
that you might run into so let's do a
quick<00:02:16.620> aside<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.129> that
