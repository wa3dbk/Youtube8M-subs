00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:06.710
 Hello apple day after year the apple 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.839
 watch all sorts of tests already 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.549
 it was being subjected to it was in 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.379
 boiling water was placed over it 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.730
 the cheese opel rubbed 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.860
 I think because they probably even with one 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.000
 cast iron skillet and worked on 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.900
 At the end you can also dive with her 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.980
 there was not even a thing there 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 was not shot on it yet 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.179
 strangely, the guys from rating aaa 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.939
 this is an american portal which 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.550
 usually shoot at all gadgets 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.840
 from apple and with heavy gun 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.789
 They did not do it, I'll take it 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.320
 quite simply everything is because they 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.969
 the apple probably got 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.750
 Unlike us, we have them 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.520
 already and we will do that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.859
 shoot at the apple watch first 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.710
 time with this little sweet cannon is 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.410
 a sixteen sp 2022 that is one 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.600
 Little talk because they 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.399
 namely allegedly illegal about 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.329
 Colombia was delivered to the United States 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.070
 a standard weapon for the military and with 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.530
 this little device if we still 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 shoot this is the g36 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.830
 so could be good for the apple watch 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.290
 go out because you do not meet for 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820
 this gun but we look and 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.680
 small note on 1 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.570
 By the way, we are not real weapons 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.939
 make fun here only on the edge 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.939
 so because we shoot times let's 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.400
 let's say we hit relatively well 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.220
 but only the edge is because of that 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.660
 they also broke all so yes 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.040
 I do not dare to be the real one 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.670
 meaning to shoot and here with the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 proof that would not have been good 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 but there is no bullet it can 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.750
 Not at all if I am anyway 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.190
 Excited is ever met 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.050
 it is not very good either 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.050
 that's right and I'm granted
