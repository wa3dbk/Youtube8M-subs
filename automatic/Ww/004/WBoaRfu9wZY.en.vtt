 but this is a separate story 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.599
 when i came to spain 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.610

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.900
 spiraling in the south this week on the carpet 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.979

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.020
 I created my account 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.370
