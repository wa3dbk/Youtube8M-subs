00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and death of a wasp not so much about

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
and death of a wasp not so much about
his<00:01:15.570> life<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.700> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
his life really but more about how he I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.649 
his life really but more about how he I
guess<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.110> flew<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.009> sugar<00:01:20.310> John<00:01:20.759> got

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
guess he flew into a sugar John got

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.560
