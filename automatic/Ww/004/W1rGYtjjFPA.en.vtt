00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
way where your mind goes one place and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.160 
way where your mind goes one place and
we're<00:04:05.850> saying<00:04:06.090> another<00:04:06.480> thing<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:06.900> they<00:04:06.990> all

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
we're saying another thing but they all

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.110 
we're saying another thing but they all
converge<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.100> end<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.490> you're<00:04:08.880> left<00:04:09.060> with

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
converge at the end and you're left with

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.550 
converge at the end and you're left with
a<00:04:09.240> very<00:04:09.420> good<00:04:09.600> feeling<00:04:09.900> about<00:04:09.960> this<00:04:10.260> brand

a very good feeling about this brand
which<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:10.980> really<00:04:11.550> what<00:04:11.730> we<00:04:11.850> want<00:04:12.570> to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
which is really what we want to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.750 
which is really what we want to
epitomize<00:04:13.140> because<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:13.560> still<00:04:13.740> are<00:04:13.920> an<00:04:14.490> ultra

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
epitomize because we still are an ultra

epitomize because we still are an ultra
premium<00:04:14.880> product<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.570> didn't<00:04:15.750> want<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.930> be

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
premium product and we didn't want to be

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.350 
premium product and we didn't want to be
cheesy
