00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
it comes to the picture quality obtained

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.939 
it comes to the picture quality obtained
from<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.639> Moto<00:03:57.120> G<00:03:57.419> it's<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:58.019> great<00:03:58.289> the<00:03:58.500> low

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
from the Moto G it's not great the low

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.099 
from the Moto G it's not great the low
resolution<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.789> photos<00:04:00.150> translates<00:04:00.810> to

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
resolution of the photos translates to

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.979 
resolution of the photos translates to
loss<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.680> detail<00:04:01.829> so<00:04:02.699> most<00:04:02.940> pictures<00:04:03.359> are<00:04:03.780> very

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
loss of detail so most pictures are very

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.140 
loss of detail so most pictures are very
grainy<00:04:04.289> so<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.859> seems<00:04:05.100> like<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.489> zoom<00:04:05.970> an

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
grainy so it seems like the zoom an

option by sliding your finger up is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.789 
option by sliding your finger up is
useless<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.120> phone<00:04:09.359> because<00:04:09.900> you'll<00:04:10.590> get

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
useless in this phone because you'll get

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
the panorama option on the phone also

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.580 
the panorama option on the phone also
creates<00:04:17.310> very<00:04:17.730> very<00:04:18.150> poor<00:04:18.510> panoramas<00:04:19.170> so

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
creates very very poor panoramas so

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.880 
creates very very poor panoramas so
they're<00:04:19.890> almost<00:04:20.190> useless<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.780> LED<00:04:22.350> flash<00:04:22.680> on

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
the back of the device is very poor as

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900 
the back of the device is very poor as
well<00:04:25.110> even<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.950> take<00:04:26.160> pictures<00:04:26.640> from

close up the LED flash can barely light

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120 
close up the LED flash can barely light
it<00:04:29.970> creates<00:04:30.360> mostly<00:04:31.170> dark<00:04:31.380> picture<00:04:31.680> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
it creates mostly dark picture so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.030
