00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 So dear readers and hungry 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.529
 readers of the magazine bakery is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.110
 this polo cup cake he almost 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.330
 cult status has certainly known it 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.550
 is john behr time because so button 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.610
 By the way, we are here in German 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 This type of cake is also called pigtail 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 or fold bread we need 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.190
 for that flour milk dry yeast and then 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.699
 without sugar eggs salt sugar is the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.620
 however optional we need butter 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.530
 of course redcurrants best red 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 and also red johannesberg jam 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:00.929
 and add icing sugar in a bowl 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.719
 we add the flour to the manne sugar 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.510
 dry yeast and about half 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.820
 teaspoon salt and then mix everything 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 Optionally, the sugar can also be added 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.120
 are given 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 I'll let him go but real cute 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.720
 of course you can shine it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.100
 use now will melt a pot 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.700
 Pour the butter to warm the milk 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 everything and then everything to mix 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.180
 with that too the eggs come with 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.460
 and now an act of a little bit begins 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.040
 our musculature demands that with the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.130
 Knee wearing the device knead him and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.800
 all in about eight minutes to one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.080
 smooth elastic dough and if it is 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.240
 looks then just about cover vienna from 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.700
 and leave it in a warm place for 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 About an hour's walk with me has 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 So we're working fine now 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.770
 knead the dough from the bowl with it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.660
 briefly through our hands again 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.900
 then choose a workspace and 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.890
 roll the dough out of it and optimally 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.369
 would be a size of 50 by 50 centimeters 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.229
 even better would be 48 x 48 cm 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 so I do not have it too closely 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.819
 The dough is then rolled out 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.610
 give abundantly from the johannes behr 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.500
 jam on it and I pass it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.250
 do that with something green orthodox 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.080
 dry lift 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.420
 you can of course just as good 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.370
 war haber 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 use apple or something else and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.230
 Now it is the dough as equal as possible 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.450
 great pieces first part in the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.400
 device in six stripes so 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.110
 I start in the middle and then share 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.480
 the two halves still two times each 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.280
 offset at the right angle repeat 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.920
 we then put the procedure on 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.890
 new at the end we have then 36 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.770
 more or less equal parts and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.709
 these layers or we are now stacking in 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.060
 a previously greased box shape her 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.730
 Of course, this shape can be flat 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.370
 put down and drive others 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.959
 layers or he almost puts them 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 perpendicular as I show it now 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.069
 You can then, for example, with books 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.200
 support and incidentally he gets the same 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.549
 an impression what I read and so 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.560
 You do not necessarily have one either 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.299
 use big box shape but you can 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.130
 also fill several small ones with it 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.739
 but visually comes the box shape 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.180
 Of course, it is best to do so now 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.370
 four to six of these particles 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.910
 give each other and in the form 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.310
 Stack and stack according to this principle 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.209
 enter all parts and the last 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.890
 you have to turn around 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.200
 so that's not with the jam 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.880
 outward that shows up here 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.019
 so prepared cake should be so 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.760
 look like 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.769
 we think it over and leave it again 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.820
 for about half an hour on one 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.070
 go warm place 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.810
 and now the oven comes before 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.609
 However, it is recommended 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.859
 if I do not show this up on top 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.519
 they drive some butter flakes 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.230
 to distribute 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 By the way, I'll pack it on a baking tray 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.880
 which is designed with foil alu 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 just in case of the jam 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.049
 or butter dripping down a bit 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.720
 baking is now circulated at 175 degrees 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.100
 150 degrees for about 35 minutes looks 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.049
 then simply times browning degree on the 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.890
 that can also be a few minutes less 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.660
 or more 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.750
 In any case, we open in between 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.390
 after about 20 minutes, briefly the oven 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.160
 and cover the cake with aluminum foil from 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.310
 close door again and close the door 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.530
 cake to the end to finish packing baked 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.720
 he should look something like this 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 leave in the shape for about half 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.750
 hour rest then plunged him out of the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.120
 shape 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.430
 that is actually relatively easy and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.260
 Let it cool completely 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.630
 and now comes the most beautiful part namely 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.700
 the design of the cake and to it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.980
 Stir would powdered sugar with about 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.930
 two tablespoons of water pass the 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.260
 klausur then generously on the cake 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.300
 and garnish finally abundantly with 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.130
 the washed currants over the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.810
 you decide on the amount of bears 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.870
 So I chose this one 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.090
 and I really like the cake 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.880
 really good he looks extravagant and 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.950
 original and the combination of 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.960
 fruits and yeast dough comes yes 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.000
 undoubtedly good anyway i wish 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 Have fun baking this 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.010
 delicious cake and then quite good 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.660
 appetite 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.850
 if you prefer to bake something else 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.430
 For example, I would like to have a zopfbrot 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.010
 here in the paschal variant or 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.080
 maybe a drawback then stays looking 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.030
 but just into these videos 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.680
 I still have to say until the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.680
 Next time bye
