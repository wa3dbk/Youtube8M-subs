from<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.270> experience<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.870> video<00:02:16.230> footage

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
from my experience the video footage

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.430 
from my experience the video footage
isn't<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.790> great<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> thought<00:02:18.900> it'd<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
isn't that all great I thought it'd be a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130 
isn't that all great I thought it'd be a
lot<00:02:19.800> better<00:02:20.130> um<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:21.060> does<00:02:21.300> look<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.870> good

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
lot better um it does look really good

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900 
lot better um it does look really good
when<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.500> button<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.520> sort<00:02:23.820> of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
when the button is actually sort of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.450 
when the button is actually sort of
situated<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:25.260> still<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.250> in

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
situated really still but you know in

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.620 
situated really still but you know in
those<00:02:26.610> moments<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.150> you're<00:02:27.270> having

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
those moments when you're having

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.270 
those moments when you're having
yourself<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.650> say<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.250> on

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
yourself like just say if I have it on

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190 
yourself like just say if I have it on
my<00:02:29.370> shirt<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.760> I'm<00:02:30.000> walking<00:02:30.180> around<00:02:30.480> it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
my shirt and I'm walking around it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620 
my shirt and I'm walking around it
doesn't<00:02:31.560> actually<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.550> lot<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> Rumble<00:02:33.540> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
doesn't actually get a lot of Rumble and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.150 
doesn't actually get a lot of Rumble and
it<00:02:33.750> doesn't<00:02:33.990> have<00:02:34.110> any<00:02:34.260> built-in<00:02:34.620> sort<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
it doesn't have any built-in sort of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.340 
it doesn't have any built-in sort of
stabilization<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.720> wish<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.900> did

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
stabilization which I really wish it did

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.110 
stabilization which I really wish it did
I'm<00:02:37.800> sure<00:02:38.070> something<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.970> be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I'm sure something like this can be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.840 
I'm sure something like this can be
fixed<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> firm<00:02:39.990> update<00:02:40.500> which<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
fixed in a firm update which are the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.940 
fixed in a firm update which are the
makers<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.360> said<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.080> if<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.530> contact

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
makers have said that if you contact

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.970 
makers have said that if you contact
them<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.430> want<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.240> new<00:02:45.450> updates<00:02:45.980> for

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
them they want to have new updates for

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.580 
them they want to have new updates for
firmware<00:02:47.370> they'll<00:02:48.360> release<00:02:48.660> them<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
firmware they'll release them and so it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.320 
firmware they'll release them and so it
can<00:02:49.710> means<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.100> could<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.310> expandable<00:02:51.000> because

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
can means it could be expandable because

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330 
can means it could be expandable because
from<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.230> forums<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.830> from<00:02:53.010> what<00:02:53.190> I've<00:02:53.310> seen

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
from the forums and from what I've seen

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.160 
from the forums and from what I've seen
on<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.790> facebook<00:02:54.120> page<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.360> lot<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.840> people<00:02:55.140> in

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
on the facebook page a lot of people in

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.080 
on the facebook page a lot of people in
asking<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.770> know<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.130> take<00:02:56.490> pictures

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
asking you know can you take pictures

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.940 
asking you know can you take pictures
continuously<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.650> they'll<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
continuously and I think they'll be a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.310 
continuously and I think they'll be a
really<00:02:59.370> good<00:02:59.490> update<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.630> could<00:03:00.990> i'm

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
really good update if they could i'm

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.260 
really good update if they could i'm
sure<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.100> know<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> firmware<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.090> could

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
sure you know in the firmware you could

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.880 
sure you know in the firmware you could
set<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.870> something<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.470> because

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
set it to something like that because

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.440 
set it to something like that because
instead<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.400> taking<00:03:05.730> video<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.120> could<00:03:06.210> take

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
instead of taking video you could take

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.810 
instead of taking video you could take
pictures<00:03:07.020> which<00:03:07.560> sort<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.890> take<00:03:08.100> me<00:03:08.130> every<00:03:08.670> two

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
pictures which sort of take me every two

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.400 
pictures which sort of take me every two
seconds<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.570> means<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.140> sort<00:03:10.320> of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
seconds and that means you can sort of

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.960 
seconds and that means you can sort of
extend<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> battery<00:03:10.920> life<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.580> extend

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
extend the battery life you can extend

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
extend the battery life you can extend
on<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.750> memory<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> because<00:03:14.250> obviously

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
on the memory and because obviously

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.700 
on the memory and because obviously
video<00:03:15.090> take<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> lot<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.260> space

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
video take you know a lot more space

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.010 
video take you know a lot more space
where<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.130> pictures<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.730> wouldn't<00:03:18.060> now<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
where it's pictures it wouldn't now I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.950 
where it's pictures it wouldn't now I
mean<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.190> find<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.730> lot<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.060> users<00:03:21.450> for

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
mean you can find a lot of users for

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.170 
mean you can find a lot of users for
this<00:03:22.260> me<00:03:22.560> camp<00:03:22.890> now<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.310> makeup<00:03:23.670> has<00:03:23.850> heaps<00:03:24.090> of
