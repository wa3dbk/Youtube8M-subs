00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.600
 today an alcatel watch 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.449
 so this is an alcatel one touch watch 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.110
 simply a watch connect to 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:19.050
 119 euros which compatible ios and android 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.500
 so the point necessarily my friend's to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.910
 know that this alcatel one touch is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.849
 equipped so no android software 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 open but proprietary software 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 own alcatel did a quick tour 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.770
 so more of this box 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 I have the white model so here it is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.270
 it's pretty simple on the right side 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.469
 so we found the compatibility 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 google and iphone you have them 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:58.050
 version here hop from highway 7 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.480
 for iphone the qr code all 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.600
 simply to download 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.040
 the application on the back you have 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.940
 so the other colors available in black 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 on the top nothing special on the other 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.220
 base side we are a little bit up so 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.670
 tell different functions of the watch 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 obviously have a notification 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 sms mails etc 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 to know that you had to finally twitter 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.760
 you have a lot of little things 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.010
 you can not answer it here 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.420
 then here you have the opportunity to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.450
 control the music here to control 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.090
 the support actually of the photo you do not have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.200
 not your screen on the watch but you 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.340
 have a button in fact simply 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 to take a picture 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.980
 it can be nice here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.010
 what was the activity 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.100
 daily so many spas etc 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.680
 to know that to enter vibrates for the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.040
 sleep to wake you here the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.970
 watch and ip67 it is resistant to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.500
 water and dust 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.840
 that's really a big highlight I 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 find and of course this kind of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.009
 watches 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 and to a frÃ©thun to a frequency sensor 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.660
 cardiac 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 this is just on the bench if I 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.590
 had to right up which you have 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 exactly the model on the wood 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.970
 you have a second cardboard just 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.989
 below we knew exactly the same at 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.209
 dish we want to clarify anyway that 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.060
 the watch and the 119 euros 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.400
 I said at the beginning but I prefer the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.480
 specify 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.380
 so the watch is back right after 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 then this little box 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:04.890
 be careful then lorient after in this 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.390
 little box what is there a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.700
 usb cable simply it's a 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.860
 usb extension 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.350
 hop there is a usb extension 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 that's just wiring and to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.320
 his rather hard ends not his door 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.250
 necessarily quality but it's at least 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.780
 the merit of being here is good 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.140
 really I'm going to prove you hop there 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.299
 why we froze this is the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.690
 question I bring you the answer 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.180
 just after then what is one 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.010
 dispute different papers everything 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.959
 simply because the watch is 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.019
 proposed in several countries that makes 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.890
 that in fact you have lots of languages and 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:57.049
 nothing more there is no charger 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.680
 sector and that go well wall socket 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:06.350
 you have that wiring up 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:10.709
 go we go to the side of the watch tac 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.420
 so aspect level there showed pretty pretty 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.880
 the screen is not huge 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.650
 seen the white outline actually it's for 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.910
 give a small effect so that for 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 have a smaller screen to be able to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.700
 propose a tariff in fact also 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.410
 as inexpensive in quotation marks here you 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.670
 have a button just for 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.660
 go back so the screen I 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.070
 do not know if you realize the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.050
 scrum still takes two pretty good 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.630
 quality the viewing angle is very very 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.260
 good in the middle of the day with the brightness 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.000
 of the watch thoroughly we can see it very well 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.760
 go see start there so the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.400
 leather bracelet bracelet so the watch 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.560
 elite and 67 is water resistant and the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.470
 dust so no problem you 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.630
 have a small little nfc logo 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.670
 then we go down athletes logo and one 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.980
 touch 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:05.450
 hop there so you have that I think that 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.090
 it is to attract you all 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.560
 just plans because you have 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.060
 the possibility of reloading the watch 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.930
 way you can reload the watch 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:19.970
 that like that there is 7 usb so that's it 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.790
 why there is really so I go 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.270
 it's done well that's not a problem 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:30.380
 open your arms if in itself is enough 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.370
 good to adjust the watch 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.650
 you just have to go down or up 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.240
 like that there is no problem it works 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.790
 very very well the handles are peace 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.680
 can be revised after the handles 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.760
 can be small there is no 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.200
 problem we can climb up will have 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.940
 so it's going to be a little jerked because 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.890
 that she might not attract much 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.840
 but we admit to seeing then we go up on 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:56.150
 go up really special 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:01.160
 the aluminum case really very 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:04.820
 very pretty on the back so here everything 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 just to measure the cost here 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.660
 some small writings 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.760
 little focus here I know 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.000
 not what it is I do not think that's 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.830
 a microphone I do not know that's so 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.120
 you know it thank you for telling me you 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.290
 have only one button on the watch 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.540
 it's on the right side 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.810
 so to light 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.470
 and a dollar watch etc you have some 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.730
 notifications whose agent is not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.990
 if you have to find it works 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:34.770
 really good and that we'll see in 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.770
 a previous video 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:42.340
 so here it is for this watch 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.950
 alcatel one touch which weighs only 55 g 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.900
 so it's really little more than that the 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.260
 screen resolution with 240 by 204 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.000
 it's not a crazy resolution but 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.070
 for such a small screen size 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.830
 very honestly that does it do we see 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.430
 becomes really very good there is no 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.240
 problem on it 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.240
 here
