enough that he's going to do something

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.099 
enough that he's going to do something
crazy<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.729> today<00:02:04.090> as<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> moon<00:02:04.539> hits<00:02:04.749> it<00:02:04.960> I

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
crazy and today as the moon hits it I

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.599 
crazy and today as the moon hits it I
think<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.829> kind<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.100> push<00:02:06.310> us<00:02:06.490> over

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
think that it can kind of push us over

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.449 
think that it can kind of push us over
the<00:02:06.759> edge<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.840> sets<00:02:08.320> up<00:02:08.619> what<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.369> were

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
the edge and that sets up what you were

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.070 
the edge and that sets up what you were
going<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.640> talk<00:02:09.819> about<00:02:10.030> about<00:02:10.420> mercury<00:02:10.899> and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
going to talk about about mercury and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.840 
going to talk about about mercury and
Jupiter<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
Jupiter and you

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.890 
Jupiter and you
yes<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.690> even<00:02:13.350> if<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.920> could<00:02:14.130> find<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.180> Grace

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
yes that even if we could find the Grace

can<00:02:44.400> also<00:02:44.780> start<00:02:45.780> firestorms<00:02:46.710> yeah<00:02:46.950> i<00:02:47.100> i'm<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
can also start firestorms yeah i i'm the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.650 
can also start firestorms yeah i i'm the
owner<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:49.290> mercury<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:49.980> aries<00:02:50.610> silence<00:02:51.390> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
owner of a mercury in aries silence it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.170 
owner of a mercury in aries silence it
was<00:02:51.930> recommend<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:53.130> silence<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.940> almost

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
was recommend well silence is almost

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.270 
was recommend well silence is almost
impossible<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:55.020> there's<00:02:55.260> enthusiasm<00:02:56.160> if

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
impossible if there's enthusiasm if

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430 
impossible if there's enthusiasm if
there's<00:02:56.490> an<00:02:56.640> idea<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.780> thing<00:02:57.990> about<00:02:58.020> that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
there's an idea but the thing about that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.770 
there's an idea but the thing about that
mercury<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:59.010> aries<00:02:59.400> when<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.910> gets<00:03:00.090> going<00:03:00.480> even

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
mercury in aries when it gets going even

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.660 
mercury in aries when it gets going even
without<00:03:00.900> Uranus<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.710> that<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.520> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
without Uranus is that it can have this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.850 
without Uranus is that it can have this
intense<00:03:03.060> dented<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.600> time<00:03:03.810> machine<00:03:04.050> gun<00:03:04.560> kind

intense dented a time machine gun kind
of<00:03:05.010> kind<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.610> attack<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.210> with<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> Lightning

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
of kind of attack and with the Lightning

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.800 
of kind of attack and with the Lightning
of<00:03:07.560> Uranus<00:03:08.010> these<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.580> unthought<00:03:09.540> out

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
of Uranus these can be unthought out

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.440 
of Uranus these can be unthought out
brilliant<00:03:10.680> ideas<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.490> are<00:03:11.640> half-cocked<00:03:12.210> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
brilliant ideas that are half-cocked and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.270 
brilliant ideas that are half-cocked and
not<00:03:12.660> quite<00:03:13.020> right<00:03:13.350> but<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.710> doesn't<00:03:14.070> matter

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
not quite right but it doesn't matter

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.520 
not quite right but it doesn't matter
because<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.300> square<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.720> Jupiter<00:03:16.140> makes<00:03:16.350> them

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
because the square to Jupiter makes them

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.900 
because the square to Jupiter makes them
seem<00:03:16.710> like<00:03:16.770> they're<00:03:17.070> gonna<00:03:17.190> solve<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
seem like they're gonna solve the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.910 
seem like they're gonna solve the
problems<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.690> world<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.740> talk

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
problems of the world and we can talk

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.490 
problems of the world and we can talk
ourselves<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:20.700> into<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> pretty

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
ourselves right into it not a pretty

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.730 
ourselves right into it not a pretty
place<00:03:22.710> today<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.490> mean<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.840> good<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
place today I mean it can be good but it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.100 
place today I mean it can be good but it
also<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.340> overdone<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.960> if

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
also can be overdone well and I think if

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.070 
also can be overdone well and I think if
there<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.560> some<00:03:28.860> energy<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.820> be<00:03:30.060> burned<00:03:30.690> off

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
there is some energy to be burned off

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.830 
there is some energy to be burned off
through<00:03:31.590> anger<00:03:31.890> through<00:03:32.340> screaming<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.690> in

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
through anger through screaming do it in

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.570 
through anger through screaming do it in
writing<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.940> would<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.690> alone<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.830> out<00:03:38.370> of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
writing you would do it alone and out of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.820 
writing you would do it alone and out of
the<00:03:38.760> way<00:03:38.940> there's<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.390> lunar<00:03:39.780> eclipse<00:03:39.830> coming
