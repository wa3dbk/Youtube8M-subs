00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.059
 mo Jays I am today, I'll show you 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.799
 quite an interesting farm 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.480
 let's look first at the resident 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.340
 who stands to my left as you 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.650
 you know very many players enough 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.890
 greedy and here such people they are very 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 value is very simple these people change 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.230
 a piece of paper on and myoldi leaflets 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.940
 a lot but they are very cheap because 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.980
 crafting just reed 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.700
 so today we will talk about firms 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.379
 cane 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.059
 I think it's not a secret to any of you 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.130
 the fact that there are very effective 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.170
 reed firms allowing to produce 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.630
 a bunch of this very stuff for 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.670
 fairly short time today will be 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.800
 not the most efficient farms but 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.900
 automated that is you can do it 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.820
 build once and forget about it 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.160
 she will passively bring you 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.140
 little reed constantly while you 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.270
 are in the world as you can see 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 this firm is a remake but a 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.500
 more precisely farm farm modifications that 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.210
 was previously shown in my videos 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.699
 link to which is now in the lower right 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.049
 corner of the screen that's why the firm build 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.420
 again, I will not just show 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.490
 the modifications that I made here in 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.479
 first here is a block on which watermelons sit 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.340
 I dug him up 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.710
 and planted the land beneath him and on this land 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.889
 put a reed but in order for this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.079
 the holiday grew I placed to his right 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.149
 under this block where it stands a bit 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.280
 water all over this firm so 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.350
 way to stick stands here and does not fall 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.689
 separately worth noting the effectiveness 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.999
 this farm when the cane grows it 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.560
 instantly throws off in the funnel he is not 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.499
 has time to fall 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.389
 I spent three tests in which I grew 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.859
 sixty four cane units 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.389
 that is, I put sixty 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.999
 four units and 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:46.819
 of these 64 I have only one case 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.829
 one fell right here and under the funnels 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.139
 stuck in this way by efficiency 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.999
 this farm in my opinion, by the way 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.039
 no one forbids you here this part 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.679
 farm which has already been shown 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.169
 reflect on this side in this way 2 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.999
 rulers pistons and 2 ruler beds will be 

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:04.399
 throw everything in one funnel and you 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.749
 get double efficiency for one 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.340
 Here is a funnel line 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.590
 Well, if you build several nearby 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 such firms the rooted reed will 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950
 unreal big well and that's it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.319
 here are the guys here today 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.790
 video I hope that it was useful to you 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.150
 as an idea automatic 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.069
 sky free sms farm without registration 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.930
 cane and hopefully now mining 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.230
 Emeralds will be the easiest for you 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.230
 doing life everyone bye yes guys this 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.239
 rift is one of the richest probably 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.609
 caves and part-time one of 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.409
 most probably my favorites because 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.140
 there is quite a large territory on 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:43.060
 mind and many resources can be found but 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.060
 which faults have two major problems
