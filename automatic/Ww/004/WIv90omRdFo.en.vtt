00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:11.152
 You should have acted. 

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:13.105
 (But) they're here. 

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:17.084
 Elder Scrolls predicted their return. 

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:22.722
 Their defeat was said to be ... just a delay. 

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:28.296
 That in the days after the opening of Oblivion's gates ... 

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:33.923
 Skyrim's sons shed their own blood. 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.730
 But no one wanted to believe it. 

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:46.773
 Think they could exist at all. 

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.979
 And when the truth came to the surface ... 

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:53.155
 fire flooded the earth! 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:00.849
 But 

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.181
 there is one feared 

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.774
 their language "DOVahKiiN" 

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:08.054
 dragon born ... 

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.881
 FUS RO DAH! 

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.181
 (in dragon language: strength, balance, strike) 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 Enjoy! It will be a pit! :)
