00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello welcome to portugal for 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.889
 the test of the second toyota auris 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.889
 generation 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.080
 this new auris salon 3 cm by 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 compared to the previous air is at 4 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 meters 27 and dust 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.629
 among the shortest in the category 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.150
 in height it is at -5 points 5 cm that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.300
 the previous one making it really 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.870
 one of the smallest nicks and all 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.360
 it gives a much slimmer profile 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 than the previous one and a posture when 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 even more dynamic among the details 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 we notice a grille but see a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.290
 double grille much tapered 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680
 ditto for projectors with pro fire to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.549
 ugly 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.470
 at the back we find this treaty 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.659
 voluntarily dynamic but the forms 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.299
 are a bit more complicated and some 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.790
 blame this shield for example 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.700
 really pot-bellied this car is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 available in 3 diesel fuel 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.380
 is obviously hybrid 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 we are trying today the hybrid that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.220
 will be in France the most sold with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
 about 70% of sales 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 inside everything iota has made an effort 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.870
 homogenization both for the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.160
 style only for the quality of materials 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.300
 however, we can judge the style 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.520
 interior 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.230
 hesitating between classicism and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.200
 originality we are far enough yet 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.930
 a reference like the new golf 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.580
 in the back we actually have two or 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 three centimeters more at the knee but 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.970
 it is because of the drawing of the files of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.580
 front seats 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.710
 what we will remember especially is that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 the space on board is quite correct 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.210
 given the size of the car and 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 that despite the decline does not height 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.210
 roof guard roof is still 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210
 suitable for the back 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 the motorization has not changed we have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.740
 still league 8 with power 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.200
 cumulative 136 horses tiny point 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.870
 improvement is the pedal law 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 accelerator that avoids time in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.740
 weather returns pretty unpleasant people 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.090
 at the cvt noise of the transmission a 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.800
 epicyclic gear apart from that nothing to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.540
 note we did not notice a drop in 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.440
 consumption despite the improvement of 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.300
 aerodynamics and reduction of 70 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.750
 kg for the weight of this version 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
 hybrid 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 we still stay around 4 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 liters and a half 5 liters in town which 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.120
 is still exceptional 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.280
 on the other hand we are always less well 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.800
 on road and highway like wings 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.170
 of the category and driving rally 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.880
 we managed to exceed 11 liters 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.130
 which is not bad 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.340
 the chassis is really very very good 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.670
 evolve in wins as well in comfort 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.410
 behaviors already because of the decline 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.660
 weight 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.900
 secondly 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.170
 the much lower center of gravity that has 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 allowed to have less hard springs 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.310
 and anti - roll bars - grotto and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.890
 all that with a lot more behavior 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.430
 effective than previously played if we 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.019
 want it and ride again very carefully 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.780
 at least for the hybrid version that 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.340
 we just tried the toyota auris from 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.969
 second generation is a real 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.569
 success 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.879
 proof of its comfort for both 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.400
 suspensions only for sound in 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.680
 net progress his behavior which is 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.500
 more dynamic and more enjoyable it's 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.049
 consumption which remain very low in 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.540
 better city than a diesel from 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.250
 the category not to mention the inside 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.609
 now better finished and a real 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.209
 chest 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.510
 in the end what we also appreciate 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.299
 it is the price that remains very wise 24 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.970
 1600 euros for the dynamic version and 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.609
 on it you have to cut out 10 % of the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.549
 bill since we have a hybrid that is 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.769
 still that at 87 g next appointment 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.930
 you with the ruis with the break version 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.930
 which will arrive in summer 2013
