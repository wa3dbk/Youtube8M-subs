Wheels<00:00:06.150> collectors<00:00:06.750> calm<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.820> couple<00:00:09.570> week

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
Wheels collectors calm so a couple week

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.540 
Wheels collectors calm so a couple week
or<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> week<00:00:10.200> ago<00:00:10.500> they<00:00:10.710> had<00:00:10.950> something<00:00:11.429> called

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
or a week ago they had something called

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.089 
or a week ago they had something called
the<00:00:11.759> virtual<00:00:12.059> vending<00:00:12.630> machine<00:00:12.960> where<00:00:13.830> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the virtual vending machine where you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.480 
the virtual vending machine where you
can<00:00:14.309> purchase<00:00:14.639> pulse<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.660> $8.99<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.680> then

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
can purchase pulse for $8.99 and then

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.109 
can purchase pulse for $8.99 and then
they<00:00:18.300> would<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:19.250> guess<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> virtual

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
they would I guess this is the virtual

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.450 
they would I guess this is the virtual
this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> actual<00:00:22.170> real<00:00:22.560> vending<00:00:22.980> machine

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
this is the actual real vending machine

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
this is the actual real vending machine
so<00:00:24.269> they<00:00:24.600> take<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.140> vending<00:00:25.529> machine<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
so they take this vending machine to the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.480 
so they take this vending machine to the
Hot<00:00:26.580> Wheels<00:00:26.730> conventions<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.099> as<00:00:29.099> part<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
Hot Wheels conventions and as part of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
Hot Wheels conventions and as part of
your<00:00:29.640> ticket<00:00:30.090> purchase<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> whatnot<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> get

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
your ticket purchase and whatnot you get

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
your ticket purchase and whatnot you get
a<00:00:31.410> free<00:00:32.099> pull<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.239> purchase

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
a free pull and I think you can purchase

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.590 
a free pull and I think you can purchase
additional<00:00:34.230> polls<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.160> $20<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
additional polls for $20 so it's a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.340 
additional polls for $20 so it's a
little<00:00:36.780> bit<00:00:36.989> more<00:00:37.140> expensive<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:40.200> then

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
little bit more expensive but and then

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
little bit more expensive but and then
basically<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:41.010> punch<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> code<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.090> your

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
basically they punch in the code on your

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
basically they punch in the code on your
ticket<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:42.989> something<00:00:43.950> falls<00:00:44.219> down<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
ticket and then something falls down you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.889 
ticket and then something falls down you
grab<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.989> treasure<00:00:46.739> hunt<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.899> some

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
grab it and it's a treasure hunt or some

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.680 
grab it and it's a treasure hunt or some
some<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:50.370> car<00:00:50.820> collectible<00:00:51.510> car

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
