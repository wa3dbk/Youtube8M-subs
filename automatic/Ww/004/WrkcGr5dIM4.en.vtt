you<00:01:18.730> can<00:01:18.880> hear<00:01:19.120> that<00:01:19.240> all<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.540> chords<00:01:19.990> sound

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
you can hear that all the chords sound

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.770 
you can hear that all the chords sound
connected<00:01:21.550> even<00:01:22.000> though<00:01:22.120> they're<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.390> random

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
connected even though they're in random

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.320 
connected even though they're in random
keys<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.440> placed<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.490> pretty<00:01:25.090> chaotic

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
keys and placed in a pretty chaotic

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:49.020 
keys and placed in a pretty chaotic
fashion<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.220> end<00:01:48.400> up<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.550> really

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
fashion so you can end up with really

00:01:49.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
fashion so you can end up with really
neat<00:01:49.240> chord<00:01:49.630> progressions<00:01:50.020> like<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.350> one

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.610 

so<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.880> pretty<00:02:17.060> simple<00:02:17.330> process<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
so it's a pretty simple process just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.940 
so it's a pretty simple process just
pick<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> high<00:02:19.850> note<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.270> use<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> pivot

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
pick a high note and use it as a pivot

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
pick a high note and use it as a pivot
point<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.400> make<00:02:22.520> sure<00:02:22.670> every<00:02:23.090> core<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.660> you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
point and make sure every core that you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
point and make sure every core that you
play<00:02:24.020> no<00:02:24.260> matter<00:02:24.380> what<00:02:24.650> chord<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.100> has<00:02:25.820> that

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
play no matter what chord it is has that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.810 
play no matter what chord it is has that
note<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> top<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.100> get<00:02:28.340> some<00:02:28.610> really
