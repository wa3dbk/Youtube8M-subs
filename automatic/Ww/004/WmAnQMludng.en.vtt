00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.260

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.780

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.850
 video seen that in the other videos 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.130
 unboxing the mouse you asked me how 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.590
 they were compared to the kit mouse 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.090
 devastator I decided to contact the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.950
 cooler master who was very kind 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.230
 they sent me the devastator kit 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.050
 we have already launched on the packaging 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.790
 we find some images of the kit the logo 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 of the codemasters is that of the cm 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.460
 storm and then the product name 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.980
 devastator gaming combo on the right side 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.050
 we find the system requirements while 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.910
 only the correct of the box we find 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.340
 the characteristics of the mouse and the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.350
 keyboard 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.920
 opening the package we find the mouse 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.990
 unprotected the keyboard is then a 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.820
 little manuel of education who 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.770
 contains warranty information 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.809
 taking a look at the mouse we notice 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.950
 immediately its beautiful design on the side 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.079
 left we have two buttons 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.150
 programmable and a little lomater e 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.549
 improve stability on the right side 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.969
 we find a rubber pad as on the side 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.979
 left on the back nothing while on 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.249
 upper front we find the two 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.140
 classic buttons the wheel and the button 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:25.420
 to vary the beady eyes which 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.579
 through the laser sensor vary from 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.380
 1,000 to two fingers 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.090
 once connected to the computer mouse 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 if you go to enlightenment it gives you one 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.950
 extra touch looks aggressive and 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.469
 announced the dpa selector e 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.479
 varying the mode varies the density 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.719
 of lighting passing by 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.810
 lighting turned off lighting 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.090
 media and then 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.799
 elimination more leads now we have one 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.750
 the keyboard is a keyboard 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.670
 customized membrane from the weapon stands 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.130
 with the gilded feedback compared to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 traditional keyboards seem 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.729
 well done and all covered in 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.619
 rubber keyboard design 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.840
 quite nice and in the right corner 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.340
 I call the logo of the cines too on 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.899
 back there are four parts in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.750
 non-slip rubber to make more 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.180
 then the top keyboard is stable 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.420
 the multimedia keys and the key for 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.530
 switch the lighting on and off 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.850
 lighting I have to say quite good 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.489
 being the second version of this 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.150
 type and by day the keys look good 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.150
 even if he looks for them 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.799
 let us now turn to the pros and cons of this 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 like then let's start with the cons I don't have 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.739
 understood the choice of putting keys 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.299
 multimedia 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.069
 when instead they would have been more useful 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.989
 of the programmable keys you can 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.530
 use in video games being that it is 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.140
 a gaming keyboard, the mouse will appear 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.880
 mine is a bit light and the sensor is not 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.739
 the maximum 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.810
 as regards profs, of course the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.970
 price is good so excellent value of 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.380
 quality price 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.840
 the keyboard looks tough 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.709
 quite good lighting for both 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 the mouse is for the keyboard 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.850
 installation is as simple as the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 kit and plug'n'play so it will be enough 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.450
 inserted into the computer without having to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.030
 install the drivers 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.100
 overall the kit is good even if there 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.609
 are some flaws justified maybe 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.950
 from the price 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.290
 think of a normal mosÃ¨ kit 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.239
 keyboard costs around 20 euros therefore 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.519
 with ten more hours you can buy 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.359
 this kit with a good keyboard and a 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.400
 good mouse for novice gamers 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.859
 in recognition of this he deserves 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.170
 the best buy for the excellent ratio of 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.280
 quality price 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.500
 let me know in the comments what it is 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.940
 think of this kit we get you 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.450
 in the next video 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.450
