is twist in opposite directions and you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.470 
is twist in opposite directions and you
can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> meat<00:00:29.850> male<00:00:30.210> and

approximately<00:01:08.909> nine<00:01:09.060> centimeters<00:01:10.100> here<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
approximately nine centimeters here we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
approximately nine centimeters here we
have<00:01:11.460> two<00:01:11.790> lengths<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> wire<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.170> ten

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
have two lengths of wire just over ten

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.460 
have two lengths of wire just over ten
centimeters<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.450> silver<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
centimeters now this is the silver on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
centimeters now this is the silver on
copper<00:01:16.500> wire<00:01:17.600> 0.8<00:01:18.600> northern<00:01:19.140> italy<00:01:20.120> and<00:01:21.120> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
copper wire 0.8 northern italy and we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.440 
copper wire 0.8 northern italy and we
have<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:22.040> do<00:01:23.040> paintings<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:24.030> finish<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
have to do paintings here to finish it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.580 
have to do paintings here to finish it
off<00:01:24.600> no<00:01:25.640> what<00:01:26.640> we'll<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:26.910> at<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.140> end<00:01:28.440> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
off no what we'll do here at the end of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
off no what we'll do here at the end of
the<00:01:28.710> wire<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.730> make<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.910> small<00:01:30.330> loop<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the wire we just make a small loop and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.590 
the wire we just make a small loop and
that's<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.010> that<00:01:32.220> i<00:01:32.280> wouldn't<00:01:32.600> fall

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's just so that i wouldn't fall

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
that's just so that i wouldn't fall
through<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.260> l'chaim<00:01:34.800> on<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.190> theta

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
through there l'chaim on me theta

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
through there l'chaim on me theta
through<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.870> when<00:01:37.080> we're<00:01:37.200> putting<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
through here now when we're putting this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.160 
through here now when we're putting this
really<00:01:37.860> chain<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.760> have<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.120> put<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> through

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
really chain we have to put it through

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
really chain we have to put it through
the<00:01:40.680> end<00:01:40.980> which<00:01:41.790> has<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> clause<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.780> will

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the end which has a clause which will

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.270 
the end which has a clause which will
call<00:01:43.200> their<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.040> male<00:01:44.280> end<00:01:44.690> though<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:46.800> simply

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
call their the male end though is simply

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.790 
call their the male end though is simply
there's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.120> lot<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.300> hole<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.780> middle<00:01:48.900> and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
there's a lot a hole in the middle and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280 
there's a lot a hole in the middle and
we<00:01:50.010> just<00:01:50.250> gently<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> push<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.020> through

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we just gently kind of push it through

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.270 
we just gently kind of push it through
it<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.370> be<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.330> tricky<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.130> get<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
it can be a little bit tricky to get the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.889 
it can be a little bit tricky to get the
hangover

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.779 

there<00:02:02.899> we<00:02:03.020> go<00:02:03.200> now<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.070> see<00:02:04.250> that's<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.549> truly

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
there we go now you see that's a truly

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.179 
there we go now you see that's a truly
chain<00:02:05.090> through<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> wire<00:02:06.289> saw<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.070> this

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
chain through the wire saw and that this

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.779 
chain through the wire saw and that this
wire<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.850> quite<00:02:08.479> flexible<00:02:09.429> now<00:02:10.429> what<00:02:10.670> would

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
wire is quite flexible now what would

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.449 
wire is quite flexible now what would
you<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.060> heroes<00:02:11.510> let's<00:02:12.140> end<00:02:12.380> here<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.310> can

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
just simply push that over four fingers

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.979 
just simply push that over four fingers
closing<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.300> claws<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.800> making<00:02:19.220> sure<00:02:19.989> it's

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
closing the claws just making sure it's
