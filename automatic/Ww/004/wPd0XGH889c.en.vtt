00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.860
 today we are going to make a recipe that 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.930
 surely you have heard of more 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.330
 than once and especially when yes 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.000
 speaks of the southern states of the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.170
 mexico even if in the end it is not one 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.150
 Mexican recipe 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.669
 let's go to make the ciri with meat we go 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.349
 to put some oil in a saucepan 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.630
 in this case only using one 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.070
 cast iron casserole should be lit. 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.989
 because it takes some time before that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:43.930
 warm up and meanwhile go by 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:45.700
 cutting the onion does not have to be 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.010
 absolutely perfect doesn't have to be 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.960
 too big but not too chopped 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.960
 finely and let's put it in the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 casserole let's add one 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.650
 clove of garlic that we leave so inter 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.130
 of peppers then you can choose here 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.350
 whether to put the sweet peppers expected 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.299
 red is fine yellow I in 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 in this case I prefer to put these 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.310
 which are 3g of the we go to cut them into 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 extremely coarse 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.720
 let it brown for a few minutes 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 so once you see that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.290
 pot learned heat evenly 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.689
 Go down slightly 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.060
 temperature and the pepper the amount 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.299
 chilli do you like me very much 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.390
 spicy so neither will I add at least 23 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.100
 dried chillies and leandro april in the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.259
 case you do not love particularly spicy 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.490
 or don't put it at all or at all 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:52.039
 you can leave it so whole ass here 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.229
 however the spicy ride so let's go to 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.970
 add it again indeed this is one 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.619
 extra spicy variety of the factory in 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.670
 this case here of course I will not go to 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.000
 strengthen the spicy but I will put one 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 sweet paprika a teaspoon pole but 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 important when putting on paprika's 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.180
 turn immediately because otherwise 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.830
 leaves a bitter taste 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.190
 at this point let's add 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.750
 the last spice is cumin and also in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.260
 this case so let's put about a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.320
 teaspoon 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.269
 at this point that our onion has 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.890
 well browned let's add the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.930
 meat in this case we have it here 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.239
 then coarsely ground 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.250
 making it pass once only though 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.109
 you can also do it with a knife or 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.519
 use also in the simple ground 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.350
 purchased in the supermarket mi 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.910
 I recommend not using a meat 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.269
 too thin because otherwise it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.269
 comes good 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.260
 and now we have to let it brown 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.629
 meat 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.980
 until it becomes almost brown a lot 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:01.470
 very dark and here is our meat 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.989
 browned well considered as times is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 more or less, that is about twenty minutes 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.730
 and let's add a little broth 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.209
 here we go to add tomatoes 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.590
 let's take the pulp part like this 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.590
 we are going to chop coarsely 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.860
 and go to add and let's go 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.099
 add a little tomato too 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.900
 let's say go over the books again 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.900
 we put about 2 tablespoons 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.520
 let's add some salt a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 bit of pepper a nice pinch of pepper 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.069
 put some marjoram and then to 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 last let's add a little bit of 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:57.330
 sugar and now let's cook for 20 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.570
 minutes half an hour we have to concentrate 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.400
 good flavors and here is our meat 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.170
 practically perfect 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.390
 and at this point it is time to 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.100
 also add beans, remove 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 the garlic clove and we put two 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:20.190
 beautiful ladles as we serve it 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.650
 our food 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.710
 then the first we say on the plate it 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:33.390
 we serve with white rice then it 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:35.870
 we put abundant rice here and then there 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.300
 put a little sour cream 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.660
 Meanwhile, however, we want to serve him 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.030
 even a nice tortillas do 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.180
 take heat quickly and let's go to 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.900
 give a fast heated to ours 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.450
 here tortillas is ready see there is 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.430
 also slightly softened 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.430
 and at this point we are going to dress 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.640
 the nice portion so then how to 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.800
 example sour cream like so much and ce 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.650
 I put it a little and just laugh 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.130
 iceberg that will serve to have some 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.130
 freshness then also in the mouth is a bit of 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:22.750
 tomato cutting into strips e 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:29.080
 this point we are going to close the 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.860
 our tortillas papa we put ourselves so 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.880
 between we make a so we cut it 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:40.180
 so let's see what the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.100
 tortillas well it's not bad version 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:48.930
 let's say more traditional version 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.930
 tortillas an appetite
