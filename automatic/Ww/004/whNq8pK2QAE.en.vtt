00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360 

this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.780> model<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.469> plasma<00:00:01.709> membrane

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
this is a model of the plasma membrane

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is a model of the plasma membrane
the<00:00:02.899> current<00:00:03.899> model<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.259> called<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.560> fluid

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
the current model is called the fluid

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.460 
the current model is called the fluid
mosaic<00:00:05.460> model<00:00:05.810> fluid<00:00:06.810> because<00:00:07.080> things<00:00:07.319> are

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
mosaic model fluid because things are

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.680 
mosaic model fluid because things are
moving<00:00:07.740> around<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.309> mosaic<00:00:09.210> because<00:00:09.360> there's

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
moving around and mosaic because there's

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.720 
moving around and mosaic because there's
a<00:00:09.750> variety<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.290> things<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> membrane<00:00:11.309> it's

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
a variety of things in the membrane it's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.490 
a variety of things in the membrane it's
a<00:00:11.849> double<00:00:12.179> layer<00:00:12.330> mainly<00:00:13.110> made<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
a double layer mainly made up of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
a double layer mainly made up of
phospholipids<00:00:13.940> each<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.389> is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
phospholipids each one of these is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.000 
phospholipids each one of these is
supposed<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> phosphate<00:00:16.410> head<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.890> then

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
supposed to be a phosphate head and then

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.730 
supposed to be a phosphate head and then
the<00:00:17.100> tails<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.029> lipid<00:00:18.300> part<00:00:18.590> but<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the tails are the lipid part but the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580 
the tails are the lipid part but the
heads<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.430> called<00:00:21.020> hydrophilic<00:00:22.020> they

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
heads are what called hydrophilic they

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.480 
heads are what called hydrophilic they
are<00:00:22.769> water-loving

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
are water-loving

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.179 
are water-loving
so<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.180> orage<00:00:24.710> spontaneously<00:00:25.710> towards<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
so they orage spontaneously towards of

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.560 
so they orage spontaneously towards of
water<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> water<00:00:27.090> outside<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
water it's a lot of water outside the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
water it's a lot of water outside the
cell<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.199> water<00:00:28.380> inside<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.949> cell<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
cell a lot of water inside the cell so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.240 
cell a lot of water inside the cell so
the<00:00:30.000> heads<00:00:30.240> face<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> water<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.949> lipid

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the heads face the water and the lipid

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
the heads face the water and the lipid
tails<00:00:32.520> face<00:00:32.820> each<00:00:33.000> other<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.899> tails

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
tails face each other and these tails

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
tails face each other and these tails
are<00:00:34.350> called<00:00:34.530> hydrophobic<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
are called hydrophobic this is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110 
are called hydrophobic this is
represents<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> cholesterol<00:00:37.380> molecule<00:00:38.120> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
represents a cholesterol molecule and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
represents a cholesterol molecule and
that<00:00:39.270> helps<00:00:39.629> give<00:00:39.690> us<00:00:39.809> strength<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that helps give us strength in the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.750 
that helps give us strength in the
membrane<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> purple<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.260> supposed<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> be

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
membrane the purple are supposed to be

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.100 
membrane the purple are supposed to be
glucose<00:00:44.760> units<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> called<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.020> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
glucose units so this is called what we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.040 
glucose units so this is called what we
call<00:00:46.280> collectively<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> glycocalyx<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
call collectively the glycocalyx so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
call collectively the glycocalyx so
basically<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> cells<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> sugar<00:00:50.489> coating

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
basically the cells have a sugar coating

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
basically the cells have a sugar coating
on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> outside<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
on the outside but that's one way you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
on the outside but that's one way you
can<00:00:53.070> tell<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> outside<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
can tell this is the outside of the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
can tell this is the outside of the
model<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.870> should<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.530> inside<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
model this should be the inside of the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
model this should be the inside of the
month<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:57.059> also<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> peripheral<00:00:58.260> protein

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
month we also see a peripheral protein

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.189 
month we also see a peripheral protein
here<00:00:59.010> those<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.149> easily<00:01:00.449> removed<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
here those are easily removed from the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
here those are easily removed from the
membrane<00:01:01.670> more<00:01:02.670> embedded<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> membrane

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
membrane more embedded in the membrane

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.929 
membrane more embedded in the membrane
would<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> integral<00:01:04.379> proteins<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
would be the integral proteins the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.380 
would be the integral proteins the
integral<00:01:06.299> proteins<00:01:06.689> might<00:01:06.990> serve<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:08.390> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
integral proteins might serve as a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
integral proteins might serve as a
carrier<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> channel<00:01:11.189> those<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
carrier or a channel those are two of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
carrier or a channel those are two of
its<00:01:12.330> functions<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> channel<00:01:13.680> or

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
its functions this one has a channel or

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.899 
its functions this one has a channel or
pore<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.560> things<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.920> lipid<00:01:17.640> insoluble

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
pore so things that are lipid insoluble

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
pore so things that are lipid insoluble
and<00:01:18.689> small<00:01:19.020> might<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> able<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.740> travel

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and small might be able to travel

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
and small might be able to travel
through<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.430> pore<00:01:20.869> things<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
through this pore things that are a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
through this pore things that are a
little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:22.920> big<00:01:23.130> might<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.549> carried

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
little bit too big might be carried

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.440 
little bit too big might be carried
across<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.869> carrier<00:01:25.710> protein<00:01:26.299> things<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
across by a carrier protein things that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
across by a carrier protein things that
are<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> lipid<00:01:27.930> soluble<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.890> hand

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
are a lipid soluble on the other hand

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
are a lipid soluble on the other hand
probably<00:01:29.700> were<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.450> across<00:01:30.720> through<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
probably were just across through the

probably were just across through the
lipid<00:01:31.380> barrier<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.430> water<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> travel

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
lipid barrier now water can travel

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.200 
lipid barrier now water can travel
across<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> membrane<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.799> quickly<00:01:35.040> by<00:01:35.579> most

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
across the membrane very quickly by most

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
across the membrane very quickly by most
any<00:01:36.420> means<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:36.930> through<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> pores<00:01:38.040> or

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
any means it can go through the pores or

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.469 
any means it can go through the pores or
can<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.619> phospholipids<00:01:41.479> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can go through the phospholipids of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
can go through the phospholipids of
course<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.530> methods<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
course we also have other methods of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
course we also have other methods of
getting<00:01:44.280> things<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> cell<00:01:45.840> pinocytosis

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
getting things into the cell pinocytosis

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.490 
getting things into the cell pinocytosis
is<00:01:47.280> cell<00:01:47.790> drinking<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.659> done<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> lot<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.480 
cells for absorption phagocytosis is
cell<00:01:53.700> eating<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> cell<00:01:56.219> membrane

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
cell eating and that has a cell membrane

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.999 
cell eating and that has a cell membrane
move<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.390> surrounds<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> substance<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
move out and surrounds the substance and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.340 
move out and surrounds the substance and
brings<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> into<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.850> cell<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.450> then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
brings it into the cell which then

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.240 
brings it into the cell which then
it's<00:02:01.680> inside<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.390> vacuole<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.660> then<00:02:04.250> combines

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's inside a vacuole that then combines

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.570 
it's inside a vacuole that then combines
with<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.640> lysosome<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.800> lysosome<00:02:08.100> has<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
with a lysosome and the lysosome has the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.120 
with a lysosome and the lysosome has the
enzymes<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> digest<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.630> food<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.619> also<00:02:10.800> have

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
enzymes to digest the food we also have

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.410 
enzymes to digest the food we also have
things<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.580> those<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.880> examples<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
things so those are examples of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.060 
things so those are examples of

pinocytosis<00:02:15.110> not<00:02:16.110> too<00:02:16.290> many<00:02:16.470> cells<00:02:16.740> do

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
pinocytosis not too many cells do

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.590 
pinocytosis not too many cells do
phagocytosis<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> mainly<00:02:17.970> white<00:02:18.120> blood<00:02:18.360> cells

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
phagocytosis is mainly white blood cells

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.770 
phagocytosis is mainly white blood cells
but<00:02:18.990> lots<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.320> cells<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.770> pinocytosis<00:02:20.780> things

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
but lots of cells do pinocytosis things

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390 
but lots of cells do pinocytosis things
can<00:02:21.990> also<00:02:22.170> exit<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> cells<00:02:22.980> things<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
can also exit the cells things that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.780 
can also exit the cells things that
maybe<00:02:23.580> were<00:02:23.790> made<00:02:24.030> by<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.300> cell<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:25.790> things

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
maybe were made by the cell or things

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
maybe were made by the cell or things
that<00:02:26.940> were<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.500> indigestible

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
that were not indigestible

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.370 
that were not indigestible
or<00:02:29.070> waste<00:02:29.280> products<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.940> those<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.870> leave

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
or waste products and those can be leave

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.790 
or waste products and those can be leave
through<00:02:31.650> exocytosis<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:33.500> sort<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.530> almost

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
through exocytosis and sort of almost

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.000 
through exocytosis and sort of almost
the<00:02:35.160> reverse<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.390> endocytosis<00:02:37.050> now

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the reverse of the endocytosis now

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.979 
the reverse of the endocytosis now
there's<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.280> special<00:02:38.610> kind<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.940> endocytosis<00:02:39.690> -

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
there's a special kind of endocytosis -

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.020 
there's a special kind of endocytosis -
I<00:02:40.020> didn't<00:02:40.410> mention<00:02:40.560> before<00:02:40.770> called<00:02:41.550> receptor

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I didn't mention before called receptor

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.390 
I didn't mention before called receptor
mediated<00:02:42.300> endocytosis<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.489> requires<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
mediated endocytosis and that requires a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.660 
mediated endocytosis and that requires a
certain<00:02:47.720> molecule<00:02:48.770> marker<00:02:49.770> shape<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.520> would

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
certain molecule marker shape that would

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.570 
certain molecule marker shape that would
bind<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.239> some<00:02:52.170> kind<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> receptor<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
bind with a some kind of receptor on the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.479 
bind with a some kind of receptor on the
cell<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:54.959> specific<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.310> brings

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
cell so it's very specific and it brings

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.810 
cell so it's very specific and it brings
in<00:02:56.840> certain<00:02:57.840> types<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.290> substances<00:02:58.950> into<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
in certain types of substances into the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.150
