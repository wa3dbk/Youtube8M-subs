activated the entire clan castle but
that<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> dangerous<00:01:26.040> clan<00:01:26.340> castle<00:01:26.790> we've

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
as well and that is actually going to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
as well and that is actually going to
prove<00:01:31.799> problematic<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.240> attack<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
prove problematic for this attack as you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
prove problematic for this attack as you
watch<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> units<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.770> dragged<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.400> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
moving right along we are going to show

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.310 
moving right along we are going to show
another<00:03:23.310> defensive<00:03:24.120> replay<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.810> moments

another defensive replay just moments

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.080 
another defensive replay just moments
later<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.769> same<00:03:25.950> clan<00:03:26.250> war<00:03:26.489> by<00:03:26.670> circles

later and the same clan war by circles
are<00:03:27.269> around<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.750> although<00:03:28.170> both<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.709> these

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
are around and although both of these

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.830 
are around and although both of these
attackers<00:03:29.190> do<00:03:29.519> have<00:03:29.730> lower-level<00:03:30.209> heroes<00:03:30.660> in

attackers do have lower-level heroes in

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.330

fact this attacker didn't have as king
at<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.880> don't<00:03:33.150> think<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
at all I don't think that was the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.170 
at all I don't think that was the
deciding<00:03:34.410> factor<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.070> these<00:03:35.220> battles<00:03:35.430> there

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
deciding factor in these battles there

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.120 
deciding factor in these battles there
is<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.329> problem<00:03:36.810> right<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.290> we've<00:03:37.680> got<00:03:37.890> wall

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
is a problem right there we've got wall

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.440 
is a problem right there we've got wall
breakers<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.609> are<00:03:38.700> not<00:03:38.880> getting<00:03:39.180> these

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
breakers that are not getting these

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.870 
breakers that are not getting these
other<00:03:39.690> enclosures<00:03:40.079> open<00:03:40.680> he<00:03:41.190> only<00:03:41.370> drops<00:03:41.609> two

wall<00:03:42.120> breakers<00:03:42.510> here<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.870> again<00:03:43.079> they<00:03:43.260> don't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
wall breakers here and again they don't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.020 
wall breakers here and again they don't
get<00:03:43.709> through<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.040> wall<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.850> going

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
get through this wall so that is going

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.360 
get through this wall so that is going
to<00:03:45.120> complicate<00:03:45.540> things<00:03:45.900> because<00:03:46.739> as<00:03:46.890> he<00:03:47.040> drops

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
to complicate things because as he drops

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.490 
to complicate things because as he drops
as<00:03:47.609> golems<00:03:48.060> instead<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.570> them<00:03:48.720> staying<00:03:49.019> spread

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
structures they are going to start to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.530 
structures they are going to start to
bunch<00:03:52.709> up<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.519> wizards<00:03:53.880> won't<00:03:54.150> have<00:03:54.390> the

bunch up and the wizards won't have the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.059 
bunch up and the wizards won't have the
protection<00:03:55.079> they<00:03:55.200> need<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.530> take<00:03:55.739> out<00:03:55.920> those

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
protection they need to take out those

protection they need to take out those
surrounding<00:03:56.609> structures<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.840> still<00:03:58.079> be

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
surrounding structures this can still be

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.229 
surrounding structures this can still be
overcome<00:03:58.799> at<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.100> point<00:03:59.340> as<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.910> attacking

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
overcome at this point as the attacking

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.910 
overcome at this point as the attacking
force<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.989> move<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.380> towards<00:04:01.769> the

that same enclosure and the units will

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.960 
that same enclosure and the units will

townhall<00:04:17.820> now<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.329> attacker<00:04:18.780> did<00:04:19.200> account

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
townhall now the attacker did account

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.199 
townhall now the attacker did account
for<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.099> brought<00:04:20.220> extra<00:04:20.609> wall<00:04:20.760> breakers

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
for that and brought extra wall breakers

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.029 
for that and brought extra wall breakers
but<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.659> down<00:04:21.870> too<00:04:22.200> late<00:04:22.440> they<00:04:22.650> wander
