 today's video we're going to see the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.809
 revised the heart rate application 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.480
 which will give us what a function 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.769
 extra a cooking a function forgiveness 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.680
 for what is our frequency average 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.270
 cardiac on the iphone and good with this 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.950
 application we can check the frequency 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.410
 heart at any time when 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.899
 wake up after exercising or 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.090
 before an important and good meeting the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.399
 heart rate monitor for routes 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.469
 tics will measure with great precision how 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.809
 fast beats your heart 'using the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.359
 camera and the flash of our smartphone 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.219
 and good as we can see the first 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.739
 seen the interface appears in the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.860
 option to measure in which you activate us 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.330
 automatically the flash and what is the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.940
 camera of our device what 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 only thing we have to do is place 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.840
 slightly our 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.390
 in the entity and what is in the flash of 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 the camera we are going to place it and once 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 that we place it does not start 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.890
 detect our heart rate and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 good the functions that this 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.850
 application is that it measures your frequency 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.980
 cardiac with the camera of your smartphone 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.590
 We can see the results of our 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.290
 heart rate on a graph has 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.750
 different types of measurement different 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.120
 as what is at rest frequency 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.490
 cardiac rhythm before and after doing 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.800
 exercise we can upload and save and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.020
 analyze our results on the site 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.670
 of rents tics chewing gum and good we can 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.410
 obviously share the results in 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 social networks as a plus in 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.260
 facebook twitter or via email and as 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.760
 we can see once we already have 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 finished or finished what is the 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.600
 frequency or measurement of our 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.300
 heart rate we have 58 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.940
 beats per minute that is in a 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.860
 as a good grade us this and good 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 when you do when you give us the option 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.190
 of when you made the measurement and already 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.910
 we can put has the general mode 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.990
 at rest you have before the exercise 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.150
 after exercise frequently 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.790
 cardiac maximum in this case I'm going to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
 to leave at rest because I am at rest 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.960
 I'm sitting and talking so I'm 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.420
 at rest and good as we can see 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.100
 here gives us the personal range in which 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.810
 is our heart rate 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.670
 How did you feel? I felt very good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
 we can add additional information 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.230
 and we can share it in our networks 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.960
 we can keep it in what it is 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.700
 this here in the calendar or in the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.710
 gender history and here we are going to put 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 both not free and as we can see here 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.030
 we have in the heart rates 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.510
 previously saved in what is in 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.730
 May on May 28 on May 24 and here 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.920
 we can keep our history 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.770
 good heart and often 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.990
 adjustments nothing else this has nothing like this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.910
 of what to move since that 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.560
 application is automatic as well 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.760
 call it fi we can only see what 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.700
 is the store to evaluate the application 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.770
 invite friends to a facebook has a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.080
 reminder but you must return by 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.210
 today you must buy it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.340
 in the pro version they do not have what they are 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.740
 announcements as we can see here the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.290
 version has unlimited measures 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.240
 reminders filters and does not have good 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.340
 Well not ads and good bands 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.660
 I hope you liked the revised that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.370
 I hope that application really is 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.920
 download this application as it is 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 super great since the galaxy s 5 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.240
 he promised a lot a lot this with what 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.640
 should its new the new integration that 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.170
 bring this phone to measure our 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.330
 heart rate but how can we 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.640
 see our iPhone 5 can also 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.520
 make our iphone 5 that and our 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.470
 iphone 5 c 4 and so on any 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.150
 device that has flash equal the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.650
 truth that is very very very very good 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.060
