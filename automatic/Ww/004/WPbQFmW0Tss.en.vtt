00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.100 
exactly a really good way to practice
this<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.550> run<00:02:07.910> around<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.270> map<00:02:08.510> placing

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
this is to run around the map placing

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.750 
this is to run around the map placing
words<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:09.680> immediately<00:02:09.950> hopping<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
words and then immediately hopping to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.970 
words and then immediately hopping to
them<00:02:10.910> by<00:02:11.810> doing<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.290> you're<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:12.770> only

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
them by doing this you're not only

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.840 
them by doing this you're not only
testing<00:02:13.550> your<00:02:13.850> key<00:02:14.300> binds<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.440> you're<00:02:15.620> also

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
testing your key binds but you're also

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:27.830 
testing your key binds but you're also
testing<00:02:16.850> your<00:02:16.970> speed<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.570> your<00:02:17.630> ranges

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.390 

another<00:02:28.840> great<00:02:29.110> way<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> practice<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> cue

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
another great way to practice is to cue

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.580 
another great way to practice is to cue
to<00:02:30.670> award<00:02:31.000> hop<00:02:31.240> combo<00:02:31.690> behind<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.110> stationary

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
to award hop combo behind a stationary

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620 
to award hop combo behind a stationary
target<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> minion<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:34.270> will<00:02:34.450> get<00:02:34.540> your

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
target like a minion this will get your

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.540 
target like a minion this will get your
ward<00:02:34.900> hopping<00:02:35.230> mechanics<00:02:35.710> down<00:02:35.860> pact<00:02:36.280> which

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
ward hopping mechanics down pact which

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.250 
ward hopping mechanics down pact which
is<00:02:36.670> by<00:02:36.790> far<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.150> hardest<00:02:37.330> part<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> combo

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
is by far the hardest part of the combo

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.620 
is by far the hardest part of the combo
after<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:39.280> master<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:40.270> left<00:02:40.510> is

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
after you master this all that's left is

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.320 
after you master this all that's left is
the<00:02:40.780> ultimate<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> top<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.710> off

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.660 

now<00:02:52.080> practice<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.620> entire<00:02:52.890> combo<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.460> bot

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
now practice the entire combo in a bot

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
now practice the entire combo in a bot
over<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.240> over<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:54.540> until<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.080> becomes

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
over and over again until it becomes

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.290 
over and over again until it becomes
second<00:02:55.710> nature<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.310> isn't<00:02:56.670> exactly<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.150> live

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
second nature this isn't exactly a live

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.000 
second nature this isn't exactly a live
player<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> know<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.230> BOTS<00:02:58.410> provide<00:02:58.770> good

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
player I know but BOTS provide good

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.650 
player I know but BOTS provide good
valuable<00:02:59.370> movement<00:02:59.850> reactions<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.540> will

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
valuable movement reactions that will

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.030 
valuable movement reactions that will
help<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.990> master<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> combo

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.740 

after<00:03:08.040> those<00:03:08.190> three<00:03:08.520> practice<00:03:08.970> steps<00:03:09.210> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
after those three practice steps you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.300 
after those three practice steps you
have<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.960> basic<00:03:10.380> enough<00:03:10.560> understanding<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> the

have a basic enough understanding of the

have a basic enough understanding of the
combo<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.640> go<00:03:11.880> live<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.120> try<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.660> in

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
combo to go live and try it out in

combo to go live and try it out in
normals<00:03:13.170> practice<00:03:14.010> makes<00:03:14.220> perfect<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.670> you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790

normals practice makes perfect and you
will<00:03:14.820> probably<00:03:15.180> fail<00:03:15.630> quite<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.960> few<00:03:16.170> times<00:03:16.350> in
