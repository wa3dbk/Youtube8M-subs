00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.000
The story of the croissant

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.660
The croissant is a symbol of France

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.660
like the Eiffel Tower

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220
or the Versailles' Castle

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.020
Its origin dates back to the seventeenth century

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.000
At that time, the Otoman Empire, that

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.159
nowadays is called Turkey,  was at war with the Holy Roman Empire

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.600
After the conquer of the Balkans and most of Hungary, the Turks were preparing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700
to invade Vienna with an army of around 200,000 soldiers

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.940
The city of Vienna was protected by a wall

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.079
therefore, the Turks invented a strategy

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.959
to pass through it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.220
they dug tunnels under the wall overnight

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.080
and entered into the city, while the inhabitants slept

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.740
However, an alarm was called by the bakers of the city, who were already working

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.740
The bakers got up early to prepare bread for breakfast

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.280
The bakers heard the Turks' arrival

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.549
So, they made lots of noise to wake up the city

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.740
Thanks to them, the inhabitants of Vienna were able to resist the Turkish ambush

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.620
In order to celebrate this victory, the bakers created a piece of bread with the Turkish flag symbol

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.100
which is the crescent moon

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.720
Eating croissant became a symbol of the victory of the people of Vienna against the Turks

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.460
It is in the late eighteenth century, with the arrival of Marie Antoinette to Versailles

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.060
that the croissant came to France

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.160
It was she who brought the symbol of the French pastry from Vienna

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.940
That is why the name "Viennoiserie" is used

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.820
to refer to this type of work
