00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.770
 hello agenda slalom one 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 x car 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.890
 I do not know that this way is not anger records 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:29.030
 I do not know what is max r13 max cards 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.180
 the rocker what you look like I can't 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.310
 and ways to fix who he is good guys I'm 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:39.309
 I can go dotana and help how much 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.100
 I drove for you to me on it very well and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.809
 kneading dynamically 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.739
 skis really fatwa moon some 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.950
 dynamics 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.920
 that is, it can load it at the same time 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.720
 k-where takes this bend takes 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.170
 because this energy to get out at the exit 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.800
 throws out of the turn that is, it gives 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.690
 this can only say such an option 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.300
 which I like here in this category 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.430
 that is, that's what I chu 2 where it is you do 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.290
 that's exactly how it is for short radius 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.229
 that is, a short twist is their element 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.300
 at the same time I'm on them and on the hills 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.729
 I'm on them while on some such 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.090
 times cocks out prone so tough and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.700
 on some on blowing on them drove and they 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.009
 everywhere vasuta good bad they 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.110
 naturally in direct plane maintenance on 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.829
 speeds bad i mean big speed 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.829
 no matter how 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.460
 problem for them but at high speed 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.040
 it is not their strong point they are not discomfort 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.780
 hem they begin to be hollowed they 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.970
 begin to grasp grab out 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.090
 stable stability of course but in 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.090
 within short turns in general 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.060
 super ski very bad so 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.800
 everything is dynamic as i like everything is gorgeous not 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 I know where she was all my life 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 why she did not come across me very much 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.130
 pleased but accordingly 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.990
 I recommend ready to take that is very 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.060
 so ha ha 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.320
 dynamism that's it 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.460
 site to not miss anything 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.460
 interesting so far
