00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.910
 and 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.830
 I'm in my parents ' house and said 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.090
 I was already playing 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.910
 and there's yesterday I'm going to talk about this because 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.349
 she did not let me do any video and I 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.700
 I will respect your right to 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.390
 Privacy 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.840
 we walk gemini I tell ya I came to 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.870
 search and we walked three miles and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.520
 but very slow one thing like that as 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.800
 if we had the choco and not if 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.110
 slow and we ran we walked ten 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.210
 minutes and we took one and I felt that 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.210
 we were like in a few talks 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 it was cool for me at least it's the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 the first time I exercise from 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.610
 about two weeks ago because I see myself 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.340
 hurt my left foot and I do not 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.290
 dared 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.330
 I did not dare to force him too 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.460
 then I had a great time greeting in 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.880
 Thanks for coming and looking for me 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.640
 that and now I'm going to make a breakfast 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.740
 I hope you like my children I 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.450
 to make cornstarch is more I'm going to make a 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.370
 tutorial can teach you how to make 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.840
 maizena and more or less by enimita 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.140
 we have the ingredients this is the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.050
 milk this is the amount of milk that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'm going to make this rate is pretty big 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.950
 so what I'm going to do there diners is 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.460
 enough to eat us three 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.590
 minutes kids and I in this house what 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.659
 I'm going to do is the following I have to take 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.929
 a little of this milk 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.050
 ok he did a trail but do not give a 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:41.150
 I'm going to put a little bit of that milk 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:47.200
 because it works for me it's more 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.200
 practical to put the cornstarch first here 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.380
 two and a half tablespoons of cornstarch 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.790
 and then dissolve it before throwing it 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.320
 in the hot pot because it will start with 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.720
 the heat can be exploited as we say 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.720
 in puerto rico we are going to throw in the pot 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 we wait a little while 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.580
 now while the right if I sing 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.070
 I still see the cornstarch until I 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.070
 feel that you have no more lumps 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 so 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.120
 forever 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.549
 all 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 We're going to keep it in the hot pot 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.530
 moving so you do not go up the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.269
 milk when it boils but anyway 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.420
 before that point you have to throw the 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.420
 cornstarch and what are we going to do this 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.520
 we are going to throw the corn that already 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.450
 dissolved 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.460
 a little bit of milk and then I have to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.970
 keep moving it until it 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.350
 Thicken when you are already a short person 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.350
 with the texture that I like 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.370
 with the consistency but not texture in 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.480
 the consistency then then I quit 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.060
 the pot of 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.830
 of the burner I hope it gets cold 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.060
 blind rooms 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.980
 and here he says to me in this list look at it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.790
 consistency and to sweeten the I them 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.530
 I recommend 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.420
 you can use the sugar that you 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.270
 want natural or can use 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.959
 any other sweetener to your liking 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.000
 but I will not recommend them carefully 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.200
 I 'm going to recommend 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.200
 that they use 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.770
 what stress stevia is healthier and so 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.000
 they can have a rich apple and 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.000
 healthy both at the same time
