00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
happened to be an 8 core processor and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
happened to be an 8 core processor and
whenever<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.380> 2

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
whenever I first did this it had about 2

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
whenever I first did this it had about 2
or<00:01:19.680> 3<00:01:19.830> cores<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.430> were<00:01:20.640> parked<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.330> where

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
or 3 cores that were parked and where

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.539 
or 3 cores that were parked and where
you'll<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> where<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> hundred

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you'll see that is where the hundred

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.999 
you'll see that is where the hundred
percent<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.630> all<00:01:24.840> mine<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.140> unlocked

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
percent is see all mine are unlocked

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.660 
percent is see all mine are unlocked
I<00:01:26.040> only<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> 4<00:01:27.439> but<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.770> yours<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.189> parked

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I only have 4 but if yours are parked

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
I only have 4 but if yours are parked
they<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.420> saying<00:01:30.750> parked<00:01:31.290> greyed<00:01:31.619> out

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
they would be saying parked greyed out

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
they would be saying parked greyed out
right<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.119> says<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> hundred

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
right here where it says a hundred

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
right here where it says a hundred
percent<00:01:34.100> alright<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.189> your

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
percent alright so if you see that your

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.350 
percent alright so if you see that your
CPU<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.759> performing<00:01:41.759> better<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
CPU can be can be performing better so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
CPU can be can be performing better so
I'm<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> show<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.970> go

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.010 
now you're not going to reap the
benefits<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:07.740> this<00:04:08.250> unless<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.120> reboot<00:04:09.600> so

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
benefits of this unless you reboot so

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.600 
benefits of this unless you reboot so
once<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.590> done<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.160> can<00:04:11.340> close<00:04:11.550> it

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
once this is done you can close it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.020 
once this is done you can close it
you're<00:04:11.970> done<00:04:12.410> close<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.819> reboot<00:04:14.819> your

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
you're done close it reboot your

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.970 
you're done close it reboot your
computer<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:16.880> when<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.000> come<00:04:18.239> back<00:04:18.269> in

are all your cores are going to be
unlocked<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.900> if<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.260> check<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.830> to

and if you had like eight cores or more
they're<00:04:38.340> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.550> say<00:04:38.700> unmarked<00:04:39.330> okay<00:04:40.080> I
