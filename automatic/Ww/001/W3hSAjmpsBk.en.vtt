control arm now what this Bush does is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170 
control arm now what this Bush does is
holds<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> location<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> lot<00:01:02.940> better

holds this location in a lot better

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
holds this location in a lot better
position<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:04.080> gives<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> more<00:01:05.250> precise

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
position which gives you more precise

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.600 
position which gives you more precise
cornering<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> big<00:01:07.439> advantage<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
cornering the big advantage also is it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
cornering the big advantage also is it
increases<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> changes<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> dynamic

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
increases and changes the dynamic

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
increases and changes the dynamic

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
which makes a car turn in better now

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
which makes a car turn in better now
remember<00:01:15.030> these<00:01:15.210> guys<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.990> quite<00:01:16.350> heavy<00:01:16.619> in

the front end and tend to understeer a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
the front end and tend to understeer a
lot<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> everything<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.340> can
