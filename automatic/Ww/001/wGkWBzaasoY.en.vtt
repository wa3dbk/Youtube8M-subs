00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.260
 usually used is used approximately 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.180
 on a 5-meter envelope 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.430
 we usually use a third party 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.710
 of the elastic then you won't do 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.059
 nothing else that does the operation of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.239
 divide your envelope by 5 meters into 3 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:41.000
 sections and then you're going to do the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:45.170
 your three tips three kits then clearly 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.510
 if you need to put more elastic mountain 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.160
 just in case a kit of two and a half pieces 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.980
 pieces will lengthen speech 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.739
 of the elastic usually that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:03.739
 used is one third of the envelope of 5 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.410
 meters then we will do this operation 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.390
 when very simple and a little bit all of you 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.390
 definitely already done 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.400
 then we will look for our little connector 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.010
 just make a simple note that you already have 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.060
 enough the more they need then 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:56.160
 we will cut the part over the oar 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.050
 against our reader the elastic 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.800
 in the initial part it is so attached 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.770
 then later here we will clearly put the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.530
 ours now with our alliance e 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.180
 we are ready to perform the action of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:21.360
 Fishing in the back usually elastic 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 you make a little pigtail as well at around 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.300
 7 8cm 10cm that these 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.300
 you tie a knot 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.780
 clearly always one after six 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.189
 the elastic of the parts is very lubricated 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.849
 where it simply knots 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:49.420
 clean them with a small cloth nino e 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.150
 we would be alright then we take the da 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.480
 we usually use this type 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.519
 by crowe that honda chrome the hour that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.920
 from chrome mainly used for 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.319
 peaches marl the reels more or less the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.040
 measurement below of our eva kits around 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.040
 and 70 75 centimeters and we'll cut a piece 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.799
 we will make a small one then here 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.490
 size by users 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.830
 we will apply this buttonhole here with this one 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.830
 terminal and elastic part 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:52.130
 the hanging practically done after 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.130
 that we will take the summit to pass 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:08.600
 inside the second piece we will make 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.080
 of the insulating tape 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.790
 it doesn't matter which color you take 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.569
 the usual one uses this qua black 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.569
 because the most common one 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.770
 we will apply about 78 cm 10 from the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.770
 terminal part of the second piece 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.000
 a very simple operation 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.040
 we will always make a throat in the part 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.370
 terminal in such a way that we will have way 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.729
 always take fishing nations 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:05:00.729
 this little solina pull it so 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:00.729
 such as oar more extension to the elastic 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.389
 so that we will be able to adjust it 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.389
 its tension inside the tip 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:16.639
 you want to see with this operation 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:22.310
 very simple for the adjustment of 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.539
 elastic is ours and lobster on the tip is 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.479
 mounted with a very operation 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.690
 simple it is usually pulled around 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.350
 a 15 20 cm now we will talk 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.350
 elastic
