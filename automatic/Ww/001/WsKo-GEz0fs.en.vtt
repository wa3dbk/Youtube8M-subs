00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300 
and I really didn't like the screen
protector<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.750> was<00:02:15.960> anti<00:02:16.350> glare<00:02:16.500> but

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
protector because it was anti glare but

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.490 
protector because it was anti glare but
it<00:02:17.760> wasn't<00:02:18.240> nearly<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.600> smooth<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:19.410> you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it wasn't nearly as smooth when you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
it wasn't nearly as smooth when you
touched<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:20.880> didn't<00:02:21.240> protect

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
touched it and it really didn't protect

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.210 
touched it and it really didn't protect
your<00:02:21.990> device<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.320> glare<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.770> good<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.130> the

the greatest because the screen

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.269 
the greatest because the screen
protector<00:06:02.759> part<00:06:03.139> covers<00:06:04.139> up<00:06:04.289> right<00:06:04.889> below<00:06:05.130> the

protector part covers up right below the
home<00:06:05.400> button<00:06:05.610> instead<00:06:05.880> of<00:06:05.940> just<00:06:06.150> going<00:06:06.300> right

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
home button instead of just going right

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.980 
home button instead of just going right
down<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.080> bottom<00:06:07.229> and<00:06:07.560> also<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.990> front

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
down to the bottom and also the front

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.950 
down to the bottom and also the front
facing<00:06:10.259> camera<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:11.210> what's<00:06:12.210> below<00:06:12.479> that<00:06:12.690> are

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
facing camera and what's below that are

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.080 
facing camera and what's below that are
two<00:06:13.620> separate<00:06:13.979> holes<00:06:14.190> two<00:06:14.460> separate<00:06:14.759> cutouts

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
two separate holes two separate cutouts

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.330 
two separate holes two separate cutouts
I<00:06:15.360> should<00:06:15.569> say<00:06:15.810> so<00:06:16.020> they<00:06:16.860> don't<00:06:17.039> just<00:06:17.219> go

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
I should say so they don't just go

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.620 
I should say so they don't just go
straight<00:06:17.639> to<00:06:17.759> the<00:06:17.789> top<00:06:18.029> like<00:06:18.330> a<00:06:18.360> little

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
straight to the top like a little

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.390 
straight to the top like a little
triangle<00:06:18.990> like<00:06:19.080> my<00:06:19.199> old<00:06:19.349> one<00:06:19.380> does<00:06:19.620> so<00:06:19.860> not

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
triangle like my old one does so not

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.950 
triangle like my old one does so not
only<00:06:20.490> does<00:06:20.669> a<00:06:20.729> little<00:06:20.969> cooler<00:06:21.120> but<00:06:21.300> provides<00:06:21.690> a

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
only does a little cooler but provides a

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.120 
only does a little cooler but provides a
little<00:06:22.229> bit<00:06:22.349> more<00:06:22.529> protection<00:06:22.710> for<00:06:23.039> your

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
little bit more protection for your

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.540 
little bit more protection for your
screen<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.729> like<00:06:24.449> I<00:06:24.569> said<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:25.710> cannot<00:06:26.310> see

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
screen and like I said you cannot see

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.800 
screen and like I said you cannot see
fingerprints<00:06:26.909> with<00:06:27.120> this<00:06:27.240> case<00:06:27.419> it's<00:06:27.630> very

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
fingerprints with this case it's very

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.870 
fingerprints with this case it's very
smooth<00:06:28.229> and<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.740> really<00:06:29.099> does<00:06:29.279> remove<00:06:29.580> glare

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
smooth and it really does remove glare

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.149 
smooth and it really does remove glare
very<00:06:30.539> well<00:06:30.779> so<00:06:31.080> that's<00:06:31.590> pretty<00:06:31.830> much<00:06:31.949> it<00:06:32.009> for

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159 
very well so that's pretty much it for

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.950 
very well so that's pretty much it for
my<00:06:32.340> unboxing<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.969> review<00:06:33.240> of<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.509> HD
