get one of two sounds some gunfire and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
get one of two sounds some gunfire and
as<00:01:46.740> long<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> hold<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> button<00:01:47.820> down

as long as you hold the button down
this<00:01:48.780> goes<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:52.369> then<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> siren<00:01:54.390> but

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
this goes on then you get a siren but

this does not continue in any way which

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
this does not continue in any way which
is<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> bummer<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:01.170> both<00:02:02.130> cases<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is a bit of a bummer in both cases the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:11.259 
is a bit of a bummer in both cases the
turret<00:02:03.540> lights<00:02:03.869> up

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269

the third sound activates when you roll
them<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.550> surface<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.900> hear<00:02:16.170> engine

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
them on a surface and you hear engine

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.789 
them on a surface and you hear engine
noises<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.450> tell<00:02:24.840> which<00:02:25.080> will<00:02:25.349> triggers

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
noises you can tell which will triggers

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.259 
noises you can tell which will triggers
this<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.310> there's<00:02:26.790> no<00:02:27.209> silver<00:02:27.780> cap<00:02:28.019> here<00:02:28.349> a

this as there's no silver cap here a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.670 
this as there's no silver cap here a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:41.110 

this<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:15.380> especially<00:03:15.730> regarding<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.880> legs

detailing<00:05:01.409> is<00:05:01.650> still<00:05:01.979> excellent<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:04.289> head

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
detailing is still excellent the head

detailing is still excellent the head
design<00:05:04.919> is<00:05:05.129> close<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.639> his<00:05:05.729> g1<00:05:06.030> counterpart

but<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> little<00:05:07.889> different<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.550> its<00:05:08.699> shape

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129

articulation<00:05:11.129> is<00:05:11.250> generally<00:05:11.759> good<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.930> the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
articulation is generally good so the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.209 
articulation is generally good so the

top-heavy<00:05:17.669> like<00:05:18.029> Powerglide<00:05:18.569> so<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.349> can<00:05:19.529> get

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
top-heavy like Powerglide so you can get

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.480 
top-heavy like Powerglide so you can get
him<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:19.979> plenty<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.639> cool<00:05:20.879> poses<00:05:22.279> there<00:05:23.279> are<00:05:23.460> a

that's<00:05:45.659> not<00:05:45.900> saying<00:05:46.259> much

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
that's not saying much

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.570
