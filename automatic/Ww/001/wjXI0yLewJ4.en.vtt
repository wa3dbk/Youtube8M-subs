00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
obviously on some of the other bats

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.000 
obviously on some of the other bats
might<00:01:01.300> be<00:01:01.420> less<00:01:01.629> might<00:01:02.079> be<00:01:02.199> more<00:01:02.350> but<00:01:02.800> on<00:01:02.890> this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
might be less might be more but on this

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.150 
might be less might be more but on this
particular<00:01:03.160> bad<00:01:03.579> about<00:01:04.560> 19<00:01:05.560> grain<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.010> you've

sticker<00:01:09.940> on<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.240> front<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.540> bat<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:11.500> one

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
sticker on the front of the bat and one

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.749 
sticker on the front of the bat and one
of<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.920> main<00:01:12.100> differences<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.729> that

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
of the main differences is that

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.490 
of the main differences is that
traditionally<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.600> Oblivion<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.259> gray

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
traditionally the Oblivion is gray

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.550 
traditionally the Oblivion is gray
nicolls<00:01:14.740> low<00:01:15.250> sweet<00:01:15.970> spot<00:01:16.270> bat<00:01:16.509> right<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:17.350> this

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
nicolls low sweet spot bat right so this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.060 
nicolls low sweet spot bat right so this
one<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.979> actually<00:01:18.450> medium<00:01:19.450> medium<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.080> high<00:01:20.259> so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
one is actually medium medium to high so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.109 
one is actually medium medium to high so
that's<00:01:21.250> just<00:01:21.340> obviously<00:01:21.759> something<00:01:22.090> that

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
that's just obviously something that

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.969 
that's just obviously something that
others<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.600> cook<00:01:22.780> prefers<00:01:23.530> he<00:01:23.680> doesn't

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
others to cook prefers he doesn't

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.350 
others to cook prefers he doesn't
