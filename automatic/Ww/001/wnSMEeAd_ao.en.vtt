for the championship so you know I was a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.600 
for the championship so you know I was a
bit<00:02:53.200> disappointed<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:53.920> they<00:02:54.190> gave<00:02:54.400> that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
bit disappointed that they gave that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.280 
bit disappointed that they gave that
match<00:02:54.820> away<00:02:55.240> without<00:02:55.510> doing<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.020> feud<00:02:56.260> between

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290

the two

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.520 
the two
I<00:02:57.390> mean<00:02:58.390> they've<00:02:58.510> had<00:02:58.540> matches<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.320> past

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
I mean they've had matches in the past

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.920 
I mean they've had matches in the past
but<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.920> was<00:02:59.950> John<00:03:00.340> Cena<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.970> heel<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.600> think

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
but it was John Cena as a heel I think

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
but it was John Cena as a heel I think
and<00:03:02.080> Rey<00:03:02.230> Mysterio<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.770> face<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.640> was

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
and Rey Mysterio as a face so I was

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.370 
and Rey Mysterio as a face so I was
pretty<00:03:04.060> disappointed<00:03:04.270> in<00:03:04.960> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
