the<00:01:37.210> arm<00:01:37.929> of<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.079> crank<00:01:38.560> itself<00:01:39.069> I<00:01:39.310> managed<00:01:39.939> to

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
the arm of the crank itself I managed to

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.080

brute<00:01:40.539> force<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:41.079> on<00:01:41.229> but<00:01:41.799> it's<00:01:42.219> something

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
brute force it on but it's something

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.279 
brute force it on but it's something
that<00:01:43.359> I'm<00:01:43.450> probably<00:01:43.569> going<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.960> look<00:01:44.079> at

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
that I'm probably going to look at

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.590 
that I'm probably going to look at
getting<00:01:44.590> sorted<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.490> replaced<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.359> not<00:01:46.539> a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
getting sorted and replaced it's not a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.300 
getting sorted and replaced it's not a
problem<00:01:47.049> that<00:01:47.200> you're<00:01:47.289> ever<00:01:47.560> likely<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:48.009> have

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
problem that you're ever likely to have

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.099 
problem that you're ever likely to have
it's<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.700> sheer<00:01:49.210> dumb<00:01:49.539> luck<00:01:49.569> of<00:01:49.960> it

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
it's just sheer dumb luck of it

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.169 
it's just sheer dumb luck of it
happening<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.799> like<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.549> say<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:51.939> not

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
happening and like you say it's not

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.999 
happening and like you say it's not
something<00:01:52.630> that's<00:01:52.659> very<00:01:52.960> likely<00:01:53.499> to<00:01:53.679> ever

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
something that's very likely to ever

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.520 
something that's very likely to ever
happen<00:01:54.340> again<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:55.450> when<00:01:55.869> you're<00:01:56.020> dealing<00:01:56.170> in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
happen again but when you're dealing in

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.800 
happen again but when you're dealing in
thousands<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.219> thousands<00:01:57.609> of<00:01:57.609> units<00:01:58.090> things

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
thousands and thousands of units things

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.590 
thousands and thousands of units things
always<00:01:59.229> crop<00:01:59.770> up<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.670> that's<00:02:01.450> just

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
always crop up like this so that's just

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.660 
always crop up like this so that's just
something<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:02.289> I<00:02:02.350> will<00:02:02.560> point<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.009> but<00:02:03.549> when

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
something that I will point I but when

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.580 
something that I will point I but when
we<00:02:03.789> get<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.209> actual<00:02:04.359> proper<00:02:04.869> details<00:02:05.380> of

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
we get to the actual proper details of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.249 
we get to the actual proper details of
the<00:02:05.649> bike<00:02:05.829> itself<00:02:06.039> it's<00:02:06.639> just<00:02:06.939> fantastic<00:02:07.389> I

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
the bike itself it's just fantastic I

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.290
