roll

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.339 
roll
essentially<00:00:30.820> it's<00:00:30.940> two<00:00:31.270> chips<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:31.930> rotate

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
essentially it's two chips that rotate

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.670 
essentially it's two chips that rotate
round<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.860> around<00:00:32.920> your<00:00:33.760> middle<00:00:33.969> finger<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
round and around your middle finger this

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.439 
round and around your middle finger this
is<00:00:35.860> derived<00:00:36.219> from<00:00:36.430> two<00:00:36.789> different<00:00:37.090> chip

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
is derived from two different chip

there's<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.789> roll<00:00:42.999> down<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:44.429> then<00:00:45.429> there's

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
there's the roll down and then there's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.880 
there's the roll down and then there's
the<00:00:45.789> opposite<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.449> roll<00:00:46.629> down<00:00:46.809> which<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
the opposite of the roll down which is

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.430 
the opposite of the roll down which is
the<00:00:48.039> butterfly<00:00:48.659> which<00:00:49.659> is<00:00:49.839> splitting<00:00:50.229> two

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
the butterfly which is splitting two

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.410 
the butterfly which is splitting two
chips<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.010> then<00:00:51.249> spreading<00:00:51.639> them<00:00:51.819> apart<00:00:52.179> so

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
chips and then spreading them apart so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.200 
chips and then spreading them apart so
you'll<00:00:53.229> recognize<00:00:53.649> this<00:00:53.920> position<00:00:54.579> during

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
you'll recognize this position during

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.329 
you'll recognize this position during
the<00:00:55.420> rock<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.809> roll<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.499> rock<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.889> roll<00:00:57.039> is

here<00:01:16.869> you're<00:01:17.049> going<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.200> separate<00:01:17.619> your

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
here you're going to separate your

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.639 
here you're going to separate your
middle<00:01:18.250> finger<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.729> thumb<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:20.110> bring<00:01:20.320> out<00:01:20.469> two

middle finger and thumb to bring out two

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.969 
middle finger and thumb to bring out two
chips<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.320> practice<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.859> I<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:26.680> warn<00:01:26.890> you

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
chips so practice that I will warn you

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.200 
chips so practice that I will warn you
that<00:01:27.070> you're<00:01:27.369> going<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.670> tendency<00:01:28.180> to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
that you're going to have a tendency to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.630 
that you're going to have a tendency to
start<00:01:28.630> off<00:01:28.810> wrong<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.369> want<00:01:30.549> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
start off wrong like this you want to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.880 
start off wrong like this you want to
hold<00:01:30.759> it<00:01:30.909> exactly<00:01:31.570> between<00:01:31.719> your<00:01:32.320> first

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
hold it exactly between your first

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.099 
hold it exactly between your first
finger<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.310> thumb<00:01:33.490> not<00:01:34.390> cradling<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.990> like

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
finger and thumb not cradling it like

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.179 
finger and thumb not cradling it like
this<00:01:35.289> because<00:01:35.649> if<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.799> hold<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.039> like<00:01:36.159> this

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
this because if you hold it like this

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
this because if you hold it like this
your<00:01:36.909> tendency<00:01:37.659> is<00:01:37.780> going<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.170> be<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.530> bring<00:01:38.799> up

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
your tendency is going to be to bring up

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.020 
your tendency is going to be to bring up
one<00:01:40.450> chip<00:01:41.130> leaving<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.189> second<00:01:42.520> one<00:01:42.609> behind

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
one chip leaving the second one behind

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.179 
one chip leaving the second one behind
and<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.990> problem<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.380> you're<00:01:44.530> now<00:01:44.679> no<00:01:45.009> longer

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
and the problem is you're now no longer

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.249 
and the problem is you're now no longer
having<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.729> chip<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.600> position<00:01:47.049> where<00:01:47.200> it

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
having a chip in this position where it

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.569 
having a chip in this position where it
needs<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.500> be<00:01:47.590> you're<00:01:47.950> going<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.100> be<00:01:48.219> here

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
needs to be you're going to be here

the<00:04:31.210> thumb<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.720> first<00:04:32.020> finger<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.620> therefore

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
the thumb and first finger to therefore

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.219 
the thumb and first finger to therefore
carry<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:34.000> back<00:04:34.479> chip<00:04:34.870> forward<00:04:35.710> again<00:04:36.639> and

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
carry this back chip forward again and

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.080 
carry this back chip forward again and
then<00:04:38.229> from<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.590> place<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.550> process<00:04:39.970> is

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
then from that place the process is

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.700 
then from that place the process is
repeated<00:04:40.240> again<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.870> again<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.290> again<00:04:41.530> as

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
repeated again and again and again as

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.850 
repeated again and again and again as
these<00:04:42.340> two<00:04:42.550> chips<00:04:42.850> rotate<00:04:43.389> around<00:04:43.860> your

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
these two chips rotate around your

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.710 
these two chips rotate around your
middle<00:04:45.100> finger<00:04:48.150> another<00:04:49.150> variation<00:04:49.419> of

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
middle finger another variation of

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.779 
middle finger another variation of
getting<00:04:49.960> into<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.229> rock-and-roll<00:04:50.789> position

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
getting into the rock-and-roll position

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.430 
getting into the rock-and-roll position
here<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.150> instead<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.460> pulling<00:04:54.460> back<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
here is instead of pulling back the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.379 
here is instead of pulling back the
middle<00:04:56.979> finger<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.669> meet<00:04:57.820> with<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.030> thumb<00:04:58.210> to

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
middle finger to meet with the thumb to

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.290 
middle finger to meet with the thumb to
begin<00:04:58.660> with<00:04:59.490> start<00:05:00.490> off<00:05:00.610> holding<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> chips

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
begin with start off holding the chips

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.740 
begin with start off holding the chips
in<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:02.080> position<00:05:02.590> as<00:05:03.000> if<00:05:04.000> I'm<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.479> going<00:05:04.690> to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
in this position as if I'm just going to

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.240 
in this position as if I'm just going to
go<00:05:04.870> forward<00:05:05.169> for<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.320> second<00:05:05.560> as<00:05:05.710> if<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.130> were

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
go forward for a second as if you were

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.110 
go forward for a second as if you were
going<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.520> do<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:08.710> butterfly<00:05:09.099> which<00:05:09.849> looks

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
going to do the butterfly which looks

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.940 
going to do the butterfly which looks
like<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:11.729> so<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> different<00:05:14.320> way<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.590> set

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
like this so it's a different way to set

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.350 
like this so it's a different way to set
it<00:05:15.039> up<00:05:15.099> but<00:05:15.340> it's<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.550> little<00:05:15.669> more<00:05:15.789> flourishing

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
it up but it's a little more flourishing

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.790 
it up but it's a little more flourishing
because<00:05:16.630> there's<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.900> bigger<00:05:17.110> move<00:05:17.440> that

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
because there's a bigger move that

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.770 
because there's a bigger move that
happens<00:05:18.160> so<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.400> begin<00:05:18.639> with<00:05:18.849> you're<00:05:19.599> going<00:05:19.690> to

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
happens so to begin with you're going to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.570 
happens so to begin with you're going to
start<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.289> and<00:05:20.590> you're<00:05:21.099> going<00:05:21.220> to<00:05:21.250> pull

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
start like this and you're going to pull

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.469 
start like this and you're going to pull
back<00:05:22.260> one<00:05:23.260> chip<00:05:23.620> from<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.430> back<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.880> let<00:05:25.300> your

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
back one chip from the back and let your

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.180 
back one chip from the back and let your
first<00:05:25.900> finger<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.229> ring<00:05:26.410> finger<00:05:26.470> press

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
first finger and ring finger press

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.820 
first finger and ring finger press
together<00:05:27.460> separating<00:05:28.389> those<00:05:28.479> chips<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.139> then

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
together separating those chips and then

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.909 
together separating those chips and then
from<00:05:30.039> here<00:05:30.720> your<00:05:31.720> thumb<00:05:32.289> and<00:05:32.530> first<00:05:32.770> finger

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
from here your thumb and first finger

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.810 
from here your thumb and first finger
are<00:05:33.340> free<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:35.200> continue<00:05:35.530> exactly<00:05:36.430> what<00:05:36.610> you

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
are free to continue exactly what you

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.870 
are free to continue exactly what you
already<00:05:37.210> know<00:05:37.620> it's<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.979> a<00:05:39.099> much<00:05:39.400> bigger

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
already know it's just a much bigger

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.839 
already know it's just a much bigger
motion<00:05:40.479> at<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:41.380> beginning<00:05:41.800> from<00:05:42.370> right<00:05:42.580> here

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
motion at the beginning from right here

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.969 
motion at the beginning from right here
to<00:05:43.270> go<00:05:43.389> all<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.810> way<00:05:43.840> around<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.410> has<00:05:44.590> more<00:05:44.830> of

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
to go all the way around it has more of

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.430 
to go all the way around it has more of
a<00:05:45.039> flourish<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.729> start<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.450> when<00:05:46.990> done<00:05:47.229> all

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
a flourish a start and when done all

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.100 
a flourish a start and when done all
together<00:05:47.889> it<00:05:48.880> just<00:05:49.030> has<00:05:49.210> more<00:05:49.419> cool<00:05:49.690> kind<00:05:49.960> of<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
together it just has more cool kind of a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.500 
together it just has more cool kind of a
look<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.289> it<00:05:50.460> it<00:05:51.460> is<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.639> lot<00:05:51.880> easier<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.450> start

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
look to it it is a lot easier to start

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.540 
look to it it is a lot easier to start
off<00:05:52.810> like<00:05:53.020> this

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
off like this

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.370 
off like this
simply<00:05:54.550> pull<00:05:55.360> one<00:05:55.599> forward<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.050> back<00:05:56.169> and

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
simply pull one forward and back and

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.950 
simply pull one forward and back and
you're<00:05:56.590> right<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:57.099> where<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.389> move<00:05:58.389> continues

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
you're right to where the move continues

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.050 
you're right to where the move continues
from<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.440> get-go<00:05:59.680> so<00:06:00.039> either<00:06:00.760> way<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:00.909> want

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
from the get-go so either way you want

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.730 
from the get-go so either way you want
to<00:06:01.180> do<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.390> give<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:01.870> a<00:06:02.020> shot<00:06:02.200> this<00:06:02.380> is<00:06:02.530> called

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
to do it give it a shot this is called

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.400 
to do it give it a shot this is called
the<00:06:02.860> rock<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.219> roll

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.530 

once<00:06:05.590> again<00:06:05.770> here's<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.160> two<00:06:06.370> variations<00:06:06.670> the

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
once again here's the two variations the

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.610 
once again here's the two variations the
normal<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.110> fairly<00:06:08.530> easy<00:06:08.560> way<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.780> then<00:06:10.780> the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
normal and fairly easy way and then the

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.990 
normal and fairly easy way and then the
way<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.800> start<00:06:12.130> off<00:06:12.280> where<00:06:12.550> it's<00:06:12.670> a<00:06:12.700> little<00:06:12.790> bit

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
way to start off where it's a little bit

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.160 
way to start off where it's a little bit
more<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.270> flourish<00:06:13.600> with<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:13.810> beginning

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
more of a flourish with the beginning

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.720 
more of a flourish with the beginning
either<00:06:14.890> way<00:06:14.980> you<00:06:15.040> want<00:06:15.160> to<00:06:15.280> do<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:15.430> give<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.610> a

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
either way you want to do it give it a

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.490 
either way you want to do it give it a
shot<00:06:15.940> well<00:06:16.420> I<00:06:16.450> hope<00:06:16.600> you<00:06:16.720> enjoyed<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.290> rock

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
shot well I hope you enjoyed the rock

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.890 
shot well I hope you enjoyed the rock
and<00:06:17.680> roll<00:06:17.770> chip<00:06:18.160> trick<00:06:18.430> it's<00:06:19.150> not<00:06:19.420> as<00:06:19.570> easy<00:06:19.660> as

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
and roll chip trick it's not as easy as

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.140 
and roll chip trick it's not as easy as
it<00:06:20.020> looks<00:06:20.230> because<00:06:20.650> like<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:20.860> said<00:06:20.980> before<00:06:21.550> with

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
it looks because like I said before with

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.150 
it looks because like I said before with
only<00:06:22.330> two<00:06:22.630> chips<00:06:22.960> your<00:06:23.170> other<00:06:23.350> fingers<00:06:23.920> aren't

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
only two chips your other fingers aren't

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.700 
only two chips your other fingers aren't
as<00:06:24.340> stable<00:06:24.670> when<00:06:25.240> you're<00:06:25.390> moving<00:06:25.510> and<00:06:25.810> the
