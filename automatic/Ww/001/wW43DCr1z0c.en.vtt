00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the back let's see what it's like from

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
the back let's see what it's like from
point<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> view<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.770> driver<00:01:16.520> being<00:01:17.520> an

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

the range I really like the way the dash

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
the range I really like the way the dash
kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> sweeps<00:01:28.259> round<00:01:28.710> -<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> bit<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
kind of sweeps round - it's a bit like a
