00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
smash and really enjoyed it so maybe i

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270 
smash and really enjoyed it so maybe i
should<00:00:33.450> follow<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.960> dreams<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
should follow my dreams it's just the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.090 
should follow my dreams it's just the
sign<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.210> anyway<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> considered<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sign but anyway it is considered one of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.709 
sign but anyway it is considered one of
the<00:00:38.190> biggest<00:00:38.399> smash<00:00:38.730> tournaments<00:00:39.329> however

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the biggest smash tournaments however

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.229 
the biggest smash tournaments however
they<00:00:39.899> also<00:00:39.930> hold<00:00:40.530> VGC<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.579> hold<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> VGC

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
they also hold VGC they hold a VGC

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
they also hold VGC they hold a VGC
tournement<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.500> venue<00:00:43.860> fee<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.160> forty

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
tournement so the venue fee is forty

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
tournement so the venue fee is forty
dollars<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.899> ten<00:00:46.230> dollars

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
dollars and then they have ten dollars

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
dollars and then they have ten dollars
per<00:00:46.920> other<00:00:47.190> game<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> believe<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.420> least<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.809> know

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
per other game I believe at least I know

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.250 
per other game I believe at least I know
for<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> BGC<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.980> ten<00:00:50.190> dollars<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
for the BGC it's ten dollars so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
for the BGC it's ten dollars so
basically<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> ten-dollar<00:00:53.489> buy-in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
basically there's a ten-dollar buy-in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.360 
basically there's a ten-dollar buy-in
and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.780> after<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.320> buy-in<00:00:55.530> you're<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and then after that buy-in you're in a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
and then after that buy-in you're in a
tournament<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.180> basically<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.230> think

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tournament and then basically I think

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
tournament and then basically I think
there's<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> payout<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.699> don't<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.329> which

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
there's a payout I don't know for which

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
there's a payout I don't know for which
spots<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> haven't<00:01:01.680> gone<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> apex

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
spots because I haven't gone to apex

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
spots because I haven't gone to apex
ever<00:01:02.760> before<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> whole<00:01:03.870> new

selfie<00:01:49.079> together<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.040> figured<00:01:50.520> I'd<00:01:50.610> let

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
selfie together but I figured I'd let

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
selfie together but I figured I'd let
you<00:01:50.850> guys<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.750> whether<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> would

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you guys know now whether I would

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
you guys know now whether I would
actually<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.369> well<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
actually do well I don't know but I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
actually do well I don't know but I
figured<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.259> good<00:01:55.560> practice<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.490> get

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
figured it would be good practice to get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.630 
figured it would be good practice to get
in<00:01:57.149> before<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.640> Virginia

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
in before I do go to the Virginia

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490 
in before I do go to the Virginia
Regional<00:02:00.000> which<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> six

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
Regional which is going to be like a six

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
Regional which is going to be like a six
hour<00:02:01.619> drive<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> hope<00:02:03.119> for

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
hour drive and you know kind of hope for

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
hour drive and you know kind of hope for
the<00:02:03.390> best<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.469> need<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> wake<00:02:04.979> up

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100

I'm kind of hoping

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.350 
I'm kind of hoping
