00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
has a resolution of 2540 LPI and it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.440 
has a resolution of 2540 LPI and it's
got<00:00:45.680> 1024<00:00:46.680> pressure<00:00:46.920> levels<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
got 1024 pressure levels which is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.439 
got 1024 pressure levels which is
amazing<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.879> guys<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
amazing because if you guys know the

amazing because if you guys know the
specs<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> older<00:00:52.379> intuos3<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
specs of the older intuos3 not the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
specs of the older intuos3 not the
current<00:00:53.760> intuos4<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> same

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
current intuos4 it's got the same

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
current intuos4 it's got the same
pressure<00:00:56.010> levels<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> same<00:00:56.850> resolution

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pressure levels and the same resolution

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
pressure levels and the same resolution
as<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.960> basically<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
as that so basically you have the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
as that so basically you have the
pressure<00:00:59.760> levels<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> sensitivity<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pressure levels and the sensitivity of a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
pressure levels and the sensitivity of a
tap<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.399> tablet<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> used<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.180> be
