okay
that's<00:00:54.200> only<00:00:54.350> one<00:00:54.560> breakers<00:00:54.920> or<00:00:55.040> another<00:00:55.220> one

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's only one breakers or another one

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.340 
that's only one breakers or another one
in<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.490> back<00:00:55.640> main<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:56.870> now<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.110> high

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
in the back main so now the high

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.400 
in the back main so now the high
voltages<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.010> energized<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.640> see<00:00:58.820> very<00:00:59.600> you

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
voltages and energized you see very you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.940 
voltages and energized you see very you
got<00:01:00.560> that<00:01:00.710> led<00:01:01.670> going<00:01:01.910> on<00:01:02.060> there<00:01:02.710> alright<00:01:03.710> so

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
got that led going on there alright so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.470 
got that led going on there alright so
that's<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.280> got<00:01:04.309> high<00:01:04.550> voltage<00:01:05.500> there<00:01:07.480> just

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
that's we got high voltage there just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.680 
that's we got high voltage there just
where<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.720> should<00:01:08.900> be<00:01:09.010> all<00:01:10.010> right<00:01:10.220> well<00:01:10.550> no<00:01:11.330> no

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
where it should be all right well no no

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.070 
where it should be all right well no no
okay

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.740 
yeah one three one two don't you hand me
the<00:01:33.250> book<00:01:33.430> over<00:01:33.759> there<00:01:35.759> yeah<00:01:36.759> know<00:01:37.479> what<00:01:37.600> that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
the book over there yeah know what that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.469 
the book over there yeah know what that
means<00:01:37.990> yeah<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:40.659> all<00:01:40.780> else<00:01:41.020> fails<00:01:41.320> rich

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.050 

okay<00:01:46.479> so<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.920> wiring<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> key<00:01:48.640> switch<00:01:48.880> is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
okay so the wiring on the key switch is

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.389 
okay so the wiring on the key switch is
such<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:52.170> such<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:54.009> turns<00:01:54.250> everything

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
such that such that it turns everything

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.719 
such that such that it turns everything
off<00:01:54.759> when<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:56.049> start<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.649> engaged<00:01:57.009> which<00:01:57.550> is

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
off when it's start is engaged which is

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.950 
off when it's start is engaged which is
strange<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.270> thought<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.570> would<00:01:58.660> leave<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
strange I thought it would leave the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.640 
strange I thought it would leave the
ignition<00:01:59.350> position<00:01:59.770> on

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.070

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
well I kind of want to up the implement

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:49.400 
well I kind of want to up the implement
a<00:05:31.900> little<00:05:32.050> bit<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.380> think<00:05:33.040> you<00:05:33.100> should

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.790 

we'll<00:05:49.860> change<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:51.470> let's<00:05:52.470> give<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.710> a

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
we'll change that to let's give it a

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.420 
we'll change that to let's give it a
seven<00:05:53.900> try<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:58.860> can<00:05:59.010> make<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.220> valley

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
seven try that you can make the valley

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:10.040 
seven try that you can make the valley
