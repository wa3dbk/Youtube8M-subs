drum ometer a device that calculates
beats<00:01:10.170> per<00:01:10.380> second<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.580> we're<00:01:11.700> set<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:11.939> for

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
beats per second so we're set up for
just<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> 10<00:01:12.689> second<00:01:13.140> run<00:01:13.259> as<00:01:13.380> fast<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.799> can

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
just a 10 second run as fast as you can

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.189 

clearly<00:05:22.900> time<00:05:23.410> warp<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:24.070> Otto<00:05:24.520> rose<00:05:24.940> made<00:05:25.720> in

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199
