00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.310
 the first act is entrenched 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.000
 a connection 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 with this campaign 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.399
 God knows how to use 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.399
 the line this will increase by which fa 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.119
 do not emit 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.460
 if you have a 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.159
 the connection and it's ready 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.179
 jijiji we can already 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.179
 we went out 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.770
 benko 15 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.679
 it's here 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.150
 now let's analyze 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.540
 that if there are conditions 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.660
 that's the lesson we can find in this part 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.560
 that number is very important because that is not going to be connected through 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 our computer 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.480
 this number we are not going to turn it on we were going to enter through our 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.149
 computer through 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.860
 of internet explorer 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 we open our 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 on this screen 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.380
 internet explorer 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 and we have it here open 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 and we are going to go to the address that is indicating us 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.750
 we are going to remove in the lower part rivas 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.650
 the three the direction of the double or double double or double 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.880
 and we started to indicate 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 address that marks us here 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 hector and came out 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 we are going to realize that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 both facets 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.240
 this button that is estimated allow 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690
 the way to add your children 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.660
 the first thing we're going to do that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.330
 we have are the parents 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 what we do is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.289
 window football folders we do not look for the folder where we go 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 include our 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.999
 in this case 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.099
 we are going to give add to the asad 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
 this file is called double 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:23.969
 this file 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.509
 basically this way is included 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.199
 if we want to create a zip file 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.339
 add assiduously 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.459
 will allow us to create false 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.129
 archives at a time 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
 for example shown excessive 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.939
 now it is being fulfilled and they are increasing 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.839
 it is not recommended to enter more than 10 files 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.799
 and at a time when the page is not found 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.059
 pulled down 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.059
 no achievements 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.569
 what continues 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.449
 we include the files in the list that we want to upload ' 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.229
 we simply put coto fails 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.799
 if we want 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.079
 we do not want to commit any 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.810
 we click where this text appears red button offers less signs 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.729
 everything will subtract 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.659
 when we put another country 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.109
 automatically from this side 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.869
 we are going to realize we wanted to release even these files 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.089
 In this phase 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.739
 are already included 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.719
 we automatically go to our stage 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.719
 and we already found them wake 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.069
 we realize that they are already insured w bush in the holes 3 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.329
 if they want to control it 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.319
 at that moment 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.309
 the richest 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.309
 we realize that Nestor his boat without contact 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.359
 let's know 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.389
 and we check that we can also put 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.869
 records 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.819
 that have to do with the closure 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.599
 four guys that have to do 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 compaore 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.959
 the conseller 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.959
 that bouquet of your favor put 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.340
 as he says that in 2007 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.639
 if we want to create a folder 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.379
 we just do not get tired of work 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.379
 and we profess him to click on the second 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.539
 he was arrested 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.539
 He said yes 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.820
 if we want to have a file 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.430
 we did not want to be 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.599
 sample 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.830
 born which we can open 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.830
 a document dated 3 1% in 2007 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.559
 fulfilling mentors in 2003 or 2007 a normal text file 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.319
 we want to create a career simply 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.909
 is going to create that new folder and that will allow us to change the name of the 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.659
 background 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.659
 the folder we can simply 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.509
 that way 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.509
 bekele we change the name and we are here 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.199
 since we can accept 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.279
 in this way we already have our new power 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.860
 and that happened simply 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.019
 files that we can go dragging asensio new folder 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.490
 we challenge you to see 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.930
 it just is not 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.620
 has its mention to this virus 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.029
 if there is another dry red goat trail 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.869
 and not at midnight
