00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.309
 Toyota mrace 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.410
 As a successor model of midship sports mr2 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.199
 Born in 1999 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.949
 However 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.949
 Although the layout of midship is the same 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.189
 nrs turns into an open model 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.109
 That character too 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.599
 mr2 has changed a lot 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.280
 This change is 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 nr will turn the power year after year 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.880
 Finally 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.450
 Having become a car only for some narrow users 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.010
 - 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.920
 It was also a reflection 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 Toyota 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 By adding the element of open air 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.560
 mr-s and 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.730
 To a model that is expected to have more users 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 I corrected high school 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 The power unit installed in mijs is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.110
 1.8 liter na in-line 4-cylinder toh cino 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.010
 1zzfb type 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.430
 The spec is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.090
 140 horsepower 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.380
 With 17.4 kg meters 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.620
 from the age of mr 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 It became modest 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.120
某 Lee has become much more compact 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.730
 Depending on the grade 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.070
 Because it was to cut one minute in the company 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.480
 This engine is 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480
 It is necessary and sufficient 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.970
 The transmissions to be combined 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 It was only mt immediately after the TSE 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.530
 In August 2000 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.570
 Has a sequential mechanism 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.670
 Immediately after 2 pedals mp was added 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.420
 Furthermore, in August 2002 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.000
 Six rear legs 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 2 pedal mt also became 6 pairs 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.410
 At this time 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.399
 Number 10 rmpha 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.659
 Even evolved because of the sequential climate 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.129
 You can now experience a more comfortable shift operation 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.259
 Light weight b and moderate power 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.169
 Athletic performance that is excellent in the balance unique to midship 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.839
 Is different 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.069
 The run of mr-s 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.359
 It's really refreshing 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.359
 Although there were unfinished parts of TSE 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.539
 Aging is made with minor changes 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.879
 With characters that everyone can pray with confidence 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.439
 At any time 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.739
 To be compared with the previous mr 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.449
 It is mr-s which does not receive the sporty treatment how 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 If you pull out the motel potential to the limit 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:04.019
 Car that can enjoy running of sports car more than enough 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 Is
