put<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.289> freezer<00:00:49.789> let<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.479> little

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
put in the freezer let it do all little

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.079 
put in the freezer let it do all little
just<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.319> it<00:00:52.379> gets<00:00:52.859> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.100> softer<00:00:53.819> I

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
just so it gets a little softer I

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.199 
just so it gets a little softer I
actually<00:00:54.809> put<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> microwave<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.209> 20

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:57.209 
actually put in a microwave for 20

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:02.209 
actually put in a microwave for 20
seconds<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.049> then<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.309> spoon<00:01:00.920> later<00:01:01.920> on

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
seconds and then I used a spoon later on

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.170 
seconds and then I used a spoon later on
I<00:01:02.249> decided<00:01:02.819> well<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.959> happens<00:01:04.440> if<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.799> just

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
I decided well what happens if we just

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
I decided well what happens if we just
cut<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> slit<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.900> squeeze<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.890> spoon<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
cut a slit here and squeeze the spoon in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.290 
cut a slit here and squeeze the spoon in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
thought a little alright so this has

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.130 
thought a little alright so this has
been<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> freezer<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.580> quite<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.610> while

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140
