pair of North Wave torpedo pluses and
there<00:00:23.390> are<00:00:23.509> a<00:00:23.570> few<00:00:23.810> things<00:00:24.019> to<00:00:24.259> comment<00:00:24.619> on

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
about this they're super light so you

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.230 
about this they're super light so you
know<00:00:28.039> if<00:00:28.130> you're<00:00:28.310> going<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.460> be<00:00:28.609> out<00:00:28.910> there<00:00:29.179> for

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
know if you're going to be out there for

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.710 
know if you're going to be out there for
hours<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.829> waits<00:00:31.669> an<00:00:31.939> issue<00:00:32.150> which<00:00:32.540> it

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
hours and waits an issue which it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.650 
hours and waits an issue which it
probably<00:00:32.930> is<00:00:33.410> for<00:00:33.739> most<00:00:33.920> riders<00:00:34.420> these<00:00:35.420> are<00:00:35.630> a

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
probably is for most riders these are a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.560 
probably is for most riders these are a
great<00:00:35.900> shoe<00:00:36.290> there's<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.980> carbon<00:00:37.670> fiber<00:00:38.150> sole

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570

great shoe there's a carbon fiber sole
for<00:00:38.960> stiffness<00:00:39.200> you'll<00:00:40.160> notice<00:00:40.550> these<00:00:40.730> are

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
for stiffness you'll notice these are

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.390 
for stiffness you'll notice these are
speed<00:00:41.180> play<00:00:41.450> enabled<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.260> basically<00:00:43.100> any

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
speed play enabled so basically any

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
and say I was a bit confused about how

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.849 
and say I was a bit confused about how
to<00:01:10.789> open<00:01:11.329> them<00:01:11.479> up<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:12.020> took<00:01:12.289> me<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> little

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
to open them up it took me a little

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.770 
to open them up it took me a little
while<00:01:13.009> I'm<00:01:13.520> embarrassed<00:01:13.999> to<00:01:14.179> say<00:01:14.210> with<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
while I'm embarrassed to say with the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.749 
while I'm embarrassed to say with the
ratchet<00:01:14.960> system<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.679> wasn't<00:01:16.039> used<00:01:16.219> to<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:16.490> one

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
ratchet system I wasn't used to this one

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.499 
ratchet system I wasn't used to this one
so<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:18.140> nobody<00:01:18.560> else<00:01:18.799> out<00:01:19.039> there<00:01:19.100> feels<00:01:19.640> like<00:01:20.329> I

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
so so nobody else out there feels like I

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.389 
so so nobody else out there feels like I
did<00:01:20.749> when<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.140> try<00:01:21.350> them<00:01:21.499> on<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.679> basically

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
did when you try them on you basically

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.120 
did when you try them on you basically
to<00:01:22.909> open<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.390> up<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.749> release<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:24.469> you

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
to open it up you release this you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.580 
to open it up you release this you
pulled<00:01:25.460> back<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:26.119> mechanism<00:01:26.659> up<00:01:27.079> here<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
pulled back this mechanism up here and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.919 
pulled back this mechanism up here and
then<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.399> have<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.729> do<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.179> pull<00:01:29.659> the

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
then all you have to do is pull the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.050 
then all you have to do is pull the
string<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.289> that<00:01:30.590> opens<00:01:31.189> it<00:01:31.369> right<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.789> and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
string and that opens it right up and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.480 
string and that opens it right up and
then<00:01:32.509> obviously<00:01:32.749> to<00:01:33.319> close<00:01:33.889> it<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
then obviously to close it it's the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.899 
then obviously to close it it's the
standard<00:01:35.859> mechanism<00:01:36.859> but<00:01:37.429> when<00:01:37.579> you're<00:01:37.759> out

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
standard mechanism but when you're out

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.849 
standard mechanism but when you're out
there<00:01:38.119> riding<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.719> can<00:01:38.749> just<00:01:39.200> press<00:01:39.619> this

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
there riding you can just press this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.309 
there riding you can just press this
lever<00:01:40.130> once<00:01:40.549> or<00:01:40.819> twice<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.329> that<00:01:41.479> releases<00:01:41.960> it

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
lever once or twice and that releases it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.859 
lever once or twice and that releases it
in<00:01:42.499> little<00:01:42.799> bits<00:01:43.009> little<00:01:43.579> increments<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:44.420> if

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
in little bits little increments so if

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.419 
in little bits little increments so if
you're<00:01:45.109> going<00:01:45.259> up<00:01:45.499> a<00:01:45.649> hill<00:01:45.889> and<00:01:45.950> your<00:01:46.249> foot

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
you're going up a hill and your foot

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.940 
you're going up a hill and your foot
starts<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.969> sweat<00:01:47.240> which<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.350> starts<00:01:48.829> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
starts to sweat which is and starts to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.620 
starts to sweat which is and starts to
get<00:01:49.069> warm<00:01:49.310> which<00:01:49.549> is<00:01:49.700> definitely<00:01:49.880> what's<00:01:50.420> been

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
get warm which is definitely what's been

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.899 
get warm which is definitely what's been
happening<00:01:51.049> up<00:01:51.409> here<00:01:51.679> then<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.639> just

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
happening up here then you can just

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.789 
happening up here then you can just
really<00:01:53.179> quickly<00:01:53.509> release<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.229> as<00:01:54.380> your<00:01:54.560> foots

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
really quickly release it as your foots

coming around each time which is great
and<00:01:59.030> yeah<00:01:59.929> that<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.529> is<00:02:00.770> read<00:02:01.189> racy<00:02:01.549> read

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.440 
I've called it racy read and there's
also<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.590> white<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.399> black<00:02:07.639> I'm<00:02:07.969> pretty<00:02:08.209> sure

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
also a white and a black I'm pretty sure

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.570 
also a white and a black I'm pretty sure
so<00:02:08.750> most<00:02:09.140> wardrobes<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.490> be

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
so most wardrobes are going to be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.320 
so most wardrobes are going to be
covered<00:02:10.940> with<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.300> shoe<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:13.040> only<00:02:13.670> thing<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
covered with this shoe the only thing in

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.839 
covered with this shoe the only thing in
terms<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:15.099> constructive<00:02:16.099> feedback<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.819> I

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
terms of constructive feedback that I

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.100 
terms of constructive feedback that I
would<00:02:17.150> give<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.540> they<00:02:17.750> are

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
would give you they are

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.290 
would give you they are
pretty<00:02:18.320> big<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.860> unfortunately<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.730> me<00:02:19.970> they

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
pretty big and unfortunately for me they

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.400 
pretty big and unfortunately for me they
are<00:02:20.600> almost<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:21.320> wide<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.860> they<00:02:22.040> are<00:02:22.070> long<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:24.380> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
are almost as wide as they are long so I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.660 
are almost as wide as they are long so I
did<00:02:25.040> feel<00:02:25.460> as<00:02:25.820> though<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.160> needed<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.430> spend

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
did feel as though I needed to spend

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.640 
did feel as though I needed to spend
more<00:02:28.910> time<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.510> shoe<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.410> better

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
more time in this shoe for it to better

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800 
more time in this shoe for it to better
mold<00:02:30.980> around<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.730> width<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.150> my<00:02:32.360> foot<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
mold around the width of my foot and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.170 
mold around the width of my foot and
certainly<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.370> apparent<00:02:34.850> when<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.060> was

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
certainly that was apparent when I was

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.030 
certainly that was apparent when I was
getting<00:02:35.480> out<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.080> saddle

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
getting out of the saddle

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.600 
getting out of the saddle
I<00:02:37.070> could<00:02:37.610> definitely<00:02:37.790> feel<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.830> needed<00:02:40.340> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
I could definitely feel that I needed to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
I could definitely feel that I needed to
just<00:02:40.640> give<00:02:41.000> them<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.300> few<00:02:41.600> more<00:02:41.750> days<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.990> break

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
just give them a few more days to break

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.100 
just give them a few more days to break
in<00:02:42.770> as<00:02:43.730> far<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.300> shoe<00:02:44.570> design<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
in as far as the shoe design is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.540 
in as far as the shoe design is
concerned<00:02:45.350> you'll<00:02:45.770> notice<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.310> there's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
concerned you'll notice that there's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.060 
concerned you'll notice that there's
almost<00:02:47.270> no<00:02:47.690> seam<00:02:48.050> you've<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:48.530> got<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.800> one

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
almost no seam you've just got this one

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.340 
almost no seam you've just got this one
seam<00:02:49.490> over<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.120> which<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> obviously<00:02:51.320> a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
seam over here which is a obviously a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.780 
seam over here which is a obviously a
deliberate<00:02:51.920> design<00:02:52.810> effort<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:55.520> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
deliberate design effort and that the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.510 
deliberate design effort and that the
whole<00:02:56.030> idea<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.280> one

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
whole idea is it's just the it's the one

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.190 
whole idea is it's just the it's the one
piece<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.090> shoe<00:02:59.330> that's<00:02:59.540> been<00:02:59.780> molded

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
piece of shoe that's been molded

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.260 
piece of shoe that's been molded
together<00:03:00.350> rather<00:03:00.830> than<00:03:01.010> different<00:03:01.880> panels

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
together rather than different panels

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.210 
together rather than different panels
all<00:03:02.540> stitched<00:03:02.900> together<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.380> create<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.100> one

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
all stitched together to create the one

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.699 
all stitched together to create the one
piece<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.330> makes<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.840> pretty<00:03:06.050> seamless

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
piece so it makes it pretty seamless

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.220 
piece so it makes it pretty seamless
looking<00:03:07.220> as<00:03:07.489> well<00:03:07.760> as<00:03:07.970> increases<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> comfort
