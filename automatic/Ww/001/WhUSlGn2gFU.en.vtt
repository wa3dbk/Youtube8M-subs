00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
here and today I'm doing a comparison

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.339

between normal phone tape and Steve

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.769 
between normal phone tape and Steve
state<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> normal<00:00:27.509> foam<00:00:27.750> tape<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:29.449> soft<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
state so normal foam tape is soft on the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.990 
state so normal foam tape is soft on the
top<00:00:32.989> has<00:00:33.989> no<00:00:34.260> pores<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.890> mean<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.280> not

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
but there's a lot more that goes into it

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.459

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
not really chemicals but a couple of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.299 
not really chemicals but a couple of
substances<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.429> it<00:01:02.429> turns<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.879> hard<00:01:03.179> and<00:01:04.309> very

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
substances and it turns it hard and very
