00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 and today we are going to talk about different models 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.330
 we have the plastic material 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 would be the polyethylene that if 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.770
 we observe has a certain brightness is a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.810
 Softer material that has less 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.059
 rigidity then for things that have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.059
 more weight we advise to put 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.079
 This reinforcement of panxon the material 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.079
 polyethylene can be white 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.710
 or color this would be a material that already 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.200
 It is manufactured exclusively in one of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.270
 these colors that the customer chooses if 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.059
 on the contrary this color does not fit 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.280
 At the customer's desire we can have it 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.440
 dyeing it means that the bag follows 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.579
 being white if we live in the pantone 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 Saints 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.049
 the second material is the reflection the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.330
 low pressure many times the customer will 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.330
 I'm asking, he asked 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.780
 This is the low pressure low pressure 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.620
 transparent 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.100
 the white pressure 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.980
 low prison where the bag or the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.310
 material already comes in this color so what 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:36.280
 we can see in the sample catalog 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.280
 with the colors already defined 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.300
 either in polyethylene or in low 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.850
 pressure on public stock we can 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:02:03.770
