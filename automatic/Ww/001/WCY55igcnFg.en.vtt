00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
how we see here we're not poor nearly

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.020 
how we see here we're not poor nearly
enough<00:02:17.650> air<00:02:17.890> through<00:02:18.160> our<00:02:18.310> condenser<00:02:18.819> we're

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
enough air through our condenser we're

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.740 
enough air through our condenser we're
right<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.080> idling<00:02:20.620> at<00:02:20.770> 300<00:02:21.459> psi<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.630> high

right now idling at 300 psi on the high

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.570 
right now idling at 300 psi on the high
side<00:02:23.050> which<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:25.180> too<00:02:25.239> high<00:02:25.599> for<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
side which is way too high for this

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240 
side which is way too high for this
vehicle<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.500> humidity<00:02:33.040> and

temperature conditions that we have

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.380 
temperature conditions that we have
right<00:02:34.989> now<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.700> again<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.849> first<00:02:37.060> thing<00:02:37.239> to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
right now so again the first thing to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.600 
right now so again the first thing to
check<00:02:37.569> when<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.500> any<00:02:38.680> a/c<00:02:38.950> complained

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610

of<00:02:39.790> not<00:02:40.000> cooling<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.470> make<00:02:41.560> sure<00:02:41.590> you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
of not cooling you want to make sure you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.110 
of not cooling you want to make sure you
got<00:02:41.920> three<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.519> there<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.819> want<00:02:43.000> to

got three on in there and you want to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.820 
got three on in there and you want to
probably<00:02:43.360> check<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.840> purity<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> your<00:02:44.410> freon

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.070 
probably check the purity of your freon
but<00:02:45.190> after<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.510> first<00:02:46.780> thing<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.049> check

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
but after that the first thing to check

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.289 
but after that the first thing to check
is<00:02:47.290> whether<00:02:47.590> or<00:02:47.799> not<00:02:47.890> your<00:02:48.130> whether<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.150> got<00:02:49.239> a

to<00:03:00.010> cool<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.400> freon<00:03:00.720> try<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.780> one<00:03:02.049> more<00:03:02.230> time

here

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819

which<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.990> like<00:03:22.990> I<00:03:23.110> said<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.650> hide<00:03:23.830> before

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
lines you can even feel it right here

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.560

that<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> line<00:04:00.840> isn't<00:04:01.850> while<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.030> high<00:04:03.239> site

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
that the line isn't while the high site

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.870 
that the line isn't while the high site
is<00:04:03.920> almost<00:04:04.920> too<00:04:05.250> hot<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.640> touch<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:07.580> low<00:04:08.580> side

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
is almost too hot to touch the low side

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.110 
is almost too hot to touch the low side
really<00:04:09.330> isn't<00:04:09.480> all<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.320> cool<00:04:10.830> for<00:04:11.190> what<00:04:11.910> this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
really isn't all that cool for what this

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.670 
really isn't all that cool for what this
for<00:04:12.480> what<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.780> would<00:04:12.900> expect<00:04:13.290> out<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.470> this

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
for what you would expect out of this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.039 
for what you would expect out of this
vehicle<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.519> we<00:04:15.120> had<00:04:15.239> changed<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.630> fan<00:04:15.840> question

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
vehicle so we had changed a fan question

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.960 
vehicle so we had changed a fan question
that<00:04:17.040> should<00:04:17.250> take<00:04:17.519> care<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.730> our<00:04:17.820> problem

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
that should take care of our problem

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.739 
that should take care of our problem
here<00:04:18.739> okay
