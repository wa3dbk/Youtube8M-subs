00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
tend not to do too much wet stuff like

tend not to do too much wet stuff like
peeling<00:00:48.460> oranges<00:00:48.610> with<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.090> because<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
peeling oranges with it because the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.520 
peeling oranges with it because the
moisture<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.770> acidity<00:00:51.190> can<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:52.480> put<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.290> little

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
moisture in acidity can can put a little

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.040 
moisture in acidity can can put a little
patina<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.250> blade<00:00:54.490> as<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:55.600> intend<00:00:55.930> of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
patina on the blade as you intend of

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.930 
patina on the blade as you intend of
oxidizing<00:00:56.560> a<00:00:56.830> little<00:00:57.040> faster<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.580> leaving

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
oxidizing a little faster and leaving

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.060 
oxidizing a little faster and leaving
some<00:00:58.090> marks<00:00:58.420> don't<00:00:59.050> really<00:00:59.290> like<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.740> so

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
some marks don't really like that so

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
some marks don't really like that so
because<00:01:00.490> a2<00:01:00.850> tool<00:01:01.060> steel<00:01:01.090> is<00:01:01.510> not<00:01:01.870> stainless

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
because a2 tool steel is not stainless

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.360 
because a2 tool steel is not stainless
so<00:01:04.950> this<00:01:05.950> uh<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:07.689> of<00:01:07.780> these<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.950> tool

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
so this uh some of these these tool

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.640 
so this uh some of these these tool
steel<00:01:09.580> knives<00:01:09.760> have<00:01:10.030> been<00:01:10.300> reviewed<00:01:11.140> by<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.320> guy

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
steel knives have been reviewed by a guy

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.510 
steel knives have been reviewed by a guy
a<00:01:11.890> couple<00:01:12.130> years<00:01:12.310> ago<00:01:14.159> can't<00:01:15.159> remember<00:01:15.370> his

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
a couple years ago can't remember his

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.640 
a couple years ago can't remember his
knife<00:01:15.820> test<00:01:16.150> calm<00:01:16.600> or<00:01:16.780> something<00:01:16.990> like<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.290> I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
knife test calm or something like that I

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.060 
knife test calm or something like that I
guess<00:01:18.280> when<00:01:19.120> he<00:01:19.150> snapped<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.810> a2<00:01:20.530> tool<00:01:20.710> steel

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
guess when he snapped the a2 tool steel

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.520 
guess when he snapped the a2 tool steel
he<00:01:21.970> found<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.420> blades<00:01:22.630> were<00:01:22.870> easier<00:01:23.470> to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
he found that the blades were easier to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.370 
he found that the blades were easier to
snap<00:01:23.890> um<00:01:24.630> being<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.840> they<00:01:26.020> they<00:01:26.260> are

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
snap um being that they they are

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.120 
snap um being that they they are
hardened<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.130> little<00:01:27.490> bit<00:01:27.640> more<00:01:28.090> than<00:01:28.479> some

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hardened a little bit more than some

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.610 
hardened a little bit more than some
other<00:01:30.130> knives<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:31.630> are<00:01:31.930> not<00:01:32.200> made<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.440> be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
other knives they are not made to be

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.370 
other knives they are not made to be
prime<00:01:33.040> tools<00:01:33.510> so<00:01:34.510> they<00:01:34.690> they<00:01:34.990> won't<00:01:35.140> snap

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
prime tools so they they won't snap

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.630 
prime tools so they they won't snap
easier<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:38.020> ones<00:01:38.290> because<00:01:39.070> they're<00:01:39.460> one

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
easier these ones because they're one

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.360 
easier these ones because they're one
piece<00:01:39.940> though<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:41.680> are<00:01:41.860> pretty<00:01:42.100> cool

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
piece though they are pretty cool

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.410 
piece though they are pretty cool
because<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.850> don't<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.180> worry<00:01:43.360> about

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
because you don't have to worry about

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.880 
because you don't have to worry about
them<00:01:43.690> breaking<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.380> can<00:01:44.530> have<00:01:44.680> this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
them breaking and you can have this

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.289 
them breaking and you can have this
hollow<00:01:45.760> back<00:01:46.479> portion<00:01:46.810> here<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.850> store<00:01:49.090> things

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
hollow back portion here to store things

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.580 
hollow back portion here to store things
but<00:01:50.229> unlike<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.720> crappy<00:01:52.720> Rambo<00:01:53.080> knives<00:01:53.290> they

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
but unlike the crappy Rambo knives they

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.410 
but unlike the crappy Rambo knives they
won't<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:57.040> won't<00:01:57.070> fall<00:01:57.520> off<00:01:57.549> at<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.030> welded

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
won't they won't fall off at the welded

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.070 
won't they won't fall off at the welded
point<00:01:58.690> here<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.939> one<00:02:01.180> here<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.420> got<00:02:01.840> some

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
point here so this one here I got some

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.640 
point here so this one here I got some
matches<00:02:02.740> inside<00:02:03.040> they<00:02:03.220> also<00:02:03.369> have<00:02:03.670> some

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
matches inside they also have some

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.850 
matches inside they also have some
cotton<00:02:05.650> balls<00:02:05.890> there<00:02:06.159> for<00:02:06.340> tinder

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
cotton balls there for tinder

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.280 
cotton balls there for tinder
for<00:02:08.370> kindling<00:02:08.790> and<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> bottom<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
for kindling and in the bottom here I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.970 
for kindling and in the bottom here I
have<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:11.330> little<00:02:12.680> compass<00:02:13.680> which

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
have a little little compass which

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
have a little little compass which
probably<00:02:14.790> doesn't<00:02:15.150> work<00:02:15.240> too<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:15.600> given<00:02:15.990> all

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
probably doesn't work too well given all

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.070 
probably doesn't work too well given all
the<00:02:16.320> all<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.340> metal<00:02:18.180> surrounding<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.870> but

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the all the metal surrounding it but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.170 
the all the metal surrounding it but
it's<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.500> there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
it's in there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.610 
it's in there
plus<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.270> could<00:02:21.330> always<00:02:21.480> pop<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
plus it could always pop it out but just

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
project one is actually really Scott

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.710 
project one is actually really Scott
sort<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.750> funky<00:03:33.140> blade<00:03:34.270> some<00:03:35.270> people<00:03:35.540> notice

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
sort of a funky blade some people notice

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.530 
sort of a funky blade some people notice
that<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.370> belly<00:03:37.790> kind<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.150> starts<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that it the belly kind of starts a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.710 
that it the belly kind of starts a
little<00:03:38.750> further<00:03:38.870> back<00:03:39.230> than<00:03:39.500> many<00:03:40.100> knives<00:03:40.720> so

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
little further back than many knives so

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.330 
little further back than many knives so
it<00:03:41.840> kind<00:03:42.050> of<00:03:42.080> has<00:03:42.230> an<00:03:42.380> interesting<00:03:42.680> shape<00:03:43.070> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
it kind of has an interesting shape to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.060 
it kind of has an interesting shape to
it<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.570> reminds<00:03:44.840> me<00:03:44.990> of<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.350> bottom<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.980> a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
it and it reminds me of the bottom of a

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.780 
it and it reminds me of the bottom of a
shark<00:03:47.020> now<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.620> Greenbury<00:03:49.070> also<00:03:49.370> has<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.550> bit

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
shark now the Greenbury also has a bit

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.449 
shark now the Greenbury also has a bit
of<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.970> funny<00:03:50.180> shape<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:50.990> sense<00:03:51.459> um

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
of a funny shape to it in that sense um

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.390 
of a funny shape to it in that sense um
I<00:03:52.730> found<00:03:53.240> that<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:53.570> works<00:03:53.990> well

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
I found that it really works well

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.490 
I found that it really works well
because<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.670> longer<00:03:56.030> blade<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:57.230> still

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
because it's a longer blade it still

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.430 
because it's a longer blade it still
gives<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.790> serrations<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.630> a<00:04:00.050> fair

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
gives you the the serrations and a fair

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.490 
gives you the the serrations and a fair
bit<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.739> flat<00:04:01.070> area<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.750> then<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.930> curve<00:04:03.200> so

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
bit of flat area and then the curve so

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.449 
bit of flat area and then the curve so
it's<00:04:03.739> quite<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.370> quite<00:04:04.489> nice<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:05.000> use

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
it's quite it's quite nice to use

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.250 
it's quite it's quite nice to use
there's<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.550> coating<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.180> knife<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.780> can

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
there's a coating on this knife you can

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.900 
there's a coating on this knife you can
probably<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.950> in<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.160> light<00:04:10.310> here<00:04:10.550> that<00:04:10.580> it's

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
probably see in the light here that it's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.250 
probably see in the light here that it's
quite<00:04:11.209> quite<00:04:12.080> scuffed<00:04:12.560> up<00:04:12.709> from<00:04:12.980> my<00:04:13.190> using<00:04:13.580> it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
quite quite scuffed up from my using it

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.310 
quite quite scuffed up from my using it
I<00:04:15.549> did<00:04:16.549> use<00:04:16.700> this<00:04:16.820> neck<00:04:17.030> quite<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> bit<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:18.230> it

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
I did use this neck quite a bit but it

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.250 
I did use this neck quite a bit but it
sharpens<00:04:18.709> up<00:04:18.829> really<00:04:19.340> really<00:04:19.489> well<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.690> I

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
sharpens up really really well and I

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.580 
sharpens up really really well and I
also<00:04:21.829> after<00:04:22.640> after<00:04:23.450> sharpening<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.729> like<00:04:25.729> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
also after after sharpening I like to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.980 
also after after sharpening I like to
drop<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.800> one<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.550> my<00:04:28.729> my<00:04:29.120> leather<00:04:29.330> strop<00:04:29.660> and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
drop this one on my my leather strop and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.200 
drop this one on my my leather strop and
that<00:04:30.590> gives<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.010> nice<00:04:31.190> nice<00:04:31.610> sharp<00:04:31.880> edge<00:04:32.030> on

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
that gives it a nice nice sharp edge on

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.510 
that gives it a nice nice sharp edge on
it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.730 

so<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.700> detailing<00:04:37.090> work<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.600> some<00:04:38.380> people

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
so the detailing work the some people

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.330 
so the detailing work the some people
may<00:04:38.920> not<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.460> rough<00:04:39.640> handles<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:41.500> one

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
may not like the rough handles that one

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.340 
may not like the rough handles that one
piece<00:04:42.550> nice<00:04:42.700> out<00:04:43.000> they<00:04:43.210> they<00:04:43.240> they<00:04:43.810> do<00:04:43.870> tend<00:04:44.230> to

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
piece nice out they they they do tend to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.190 
piece nice out they they they do tend to
be<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.770> bit<00:04:45.250> hard<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.850> on<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> skin<00:04:46.540> if<00:04:46.960> you

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
be a bit hard on the on the skin if you
