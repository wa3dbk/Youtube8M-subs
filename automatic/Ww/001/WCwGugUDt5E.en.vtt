00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.629
 dissection of the dorsal aspect of the brain 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.040
 to begin this dissection 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:14.070
 we will identify first in an element 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.300
 average in aragon or viles that covers all 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 the dorsal aspect of the cerebral hemisphere 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.839
 we identified a vascular element that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.870
 is the vein in automatic major or vein of 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.180
 trola talk 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.790
 we know that oatmeal is related 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.180
 anatomical with the superior sagittal sinus and 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.910
 with superficial silvian oats 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.170
 we identified the inter session 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.900
 hemispheric we identify the is a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.220
 central or roland rolando ahead 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.800
 south concentrated rolando 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.290
 we identify the turn present three 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.629
 central also known as area 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.740
 primary motor or area four of shoots 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.770
 four of brockman 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.140
 backwards we identify this turn that 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.290
 it is the central turn also known as 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.020
 area are primary aesthetic or area 312 of 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.140
 broadway 312 product 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.939
 we know that what is ahead or 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.210
 previous of the central advisor is the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.479
 frontal lobe what is behind is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.799
 the parietal lobe and more posterior 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.799
 we have the occipital lobe 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 we know that in the background of the lady 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 inter hemispheric the body is located 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.520
 callous 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.340
 in the right hemisphere of this same 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.440
 specimen we removed the mobiles and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.570
 we identify the grooves we identify 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.200
 the central groove or of rolling the turn 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.160
 pre central and the post central area 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.840
 4 broadband area 3 12 outbreak 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.760
 we identify the frontal lobe to the loop 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.990
 parietal and more posterior the lobe 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.020
 occipital 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 once this is done we submit to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.090
 cerebral hemisphere to the kingler method what 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.460
 we put to freezing at least 15 degrees 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.680
 centigrade for 8 days 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 we remove it from the freezer we allow 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.810
 thaw at room temperature 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.759
 and we started to remove the bark 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.400
 cerebral hemisphere convexity 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.000
 brain which allows us to see the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.370
 short association fibers or fibers 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.390
 Meiners uniform or hay old 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.220
 payroll we identify the central groove or 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.459
 from rolando rolando to jirÃ³n present the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
 central post central turn the turn by 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.500
 central area 312 of blood man area are 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.250
 primary aesthetic turn pre central area 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.050
 4 of de brotman the primary motor area 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.320
 and we deliver lobe frontal lobe 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.540
 parietal and occipital lobe we design the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.480
 gray substance of the face by the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.900
 cerebral hemisphere to be able to make a 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 greater exposure of the corpus callosum 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.110
 we know that in the background of the advice 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.260
 inter hemispherical we locate the body 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.150
 Callosum and dorsal to corpus callosum 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.610
 we found the gray induction and the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.480
 longitudinal grooves 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.760
 we will show these structures more 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.720
 in more detail in more sections 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720
 deep
