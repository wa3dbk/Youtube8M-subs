00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
that a nice little segue we get to see

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.480 
that a nice little segue we get to see
Wells<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.090> Cisco<00:05:13.539> in<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.500> one<00:05:14.770> scene<00:05:15.130> again

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
Wells and Cisco in that one scene again

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.629 
Wells and Cisco in that one scene again
got<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.910> like<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:17.289> scene<00:05:17.530> from<00:05:17.560> episode<00:05:18.190> 15

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
got it like the scene from episode 15

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.460 
got it like the scene from episode 15
it's<00:05:18.910> not<00:05:19.120> really<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.510> scene<00:05:19.840> from<00:05:20.020> episode

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
it's not really the scene from episode

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.279 
it's not really the scene from episode
15<00:05:20.950> I'm<00:05:21.669> assuming<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:22.539> time<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.840> flash

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
15 I'm assuming that this time the flash

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.190 
15 I'm assuming that this time the flash
will<00:05:23.560> either<00:05:23.740> save<00:05:24.160> him<00:05:24.430> or<00:05:24.700> will<00:05:25.450> be<00:05:25.930> some

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
will either save him or will be some

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.640 
will either save him or will be some
some<00:05:26.979> kind<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.310> trap<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.850> something<00:05:28.500> also<00:05:29.500> it

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
some kind of trap or something also it

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.870 
some kind of trap or something also it
could<00:05:29.740> have<00:05:29.919> something<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:30.340> do<00:05:30.580> with<00:05:30.610> this

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
could have something to do with this

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.659 
could have something to do with this
virtual<00:05:31.419> reality<00:05:32.050> vibe<00:05:32.680> looking<00:05:33.190> goggles<00:05:33.580> he

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
was wearing in one of the trailers could

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.860 
was wearing in one of the trailers could
have<00:05:36.130> something<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.490> do<00:05:36.669> with<00:05:36.700> that<00:05:36.880> can't

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
thing that that's going to be the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.140 
thing that that's going to be the
shapeshifter<00:06:03.130> yeah<00:06:03.190> because<00:06:03.490> buried<00:06:03.940> just
