00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
then for the whole rest of the next day

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
then for the whole rest of the next day
now<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> reason<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> we're<00:01:16.170> smoking<00:01:16.590> them

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
now the reason that we're smoking them

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
now the reason that we're smoking them
for<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.009> least<00:01:17.159> eight<00:01:17.460> hours<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.229> around

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
for at least eight hours is that around

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
for at least eight hours is that around
the<00:01:19.409> peel<00:01:19.770> there's<00:01:20.130> an<00:01:20.280> acid<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.689> asset

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the peel there's an acid and this asset

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
the peel there's an acid and this asset
makes<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.650> difficult<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.220> digest<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.820> almond

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
makes it difficult to digest the almond

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.380 
makes it difficult to digest the almond
called<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.659> enzyme<00:01:25.110> inhibitor<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> by

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
called an enzyme inhibitor and so by

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.550 
called an enzyme inhibitor and so by
soaking<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.049> eight<00:01:28.170> hours<00:01:28.290> you're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
soaking it for eight hours you're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
soaking it for eight hours you're
soaking<00:01:29.009> off<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> acid<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> other

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
soaking off that acid now the other

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
soaking off that acid now the other
reason<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:31.770> doing<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.369> because

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
reason that we're doing this is because

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
reason that we're doing this is because
the<00:01:32.820> elements<00:01:33.390> clumps<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.710> don't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the elements clumps up like this I don't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.370 
the elements clumps up like this I don't
know

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
know

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.789 
know
yeah<00:01:35.710> but<00:01:36.399> they<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:36.670> really<00:01:36.850> plump<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
yeah but they get really plump and it

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.550 
yeah but they get really plump and it
kind<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.159> starts<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.850> germination<00:01:40.570> period<00:01:41.380> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
kind of starts the germination period of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.039 
kind of starts the germination period of
the<00:01:41.740> nut<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.460> activates<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.509> dormant

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
the nut so it activates this dormant

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.080 
the nut so it activates this dormant
energy<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> net<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.070> starts<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.729> turn<00:01:45.939> it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
energy in the net and starts to turn it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.999 
energy in the net and starts to turn it
into<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.390> little<00:01:46.450> baby<00:01:46.810> plant<00:01:47.289> so<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.470> changes

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
into a little baby plant so it changes

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.669 
into a little baby plant so it changes
the<00:01:48.280> composition<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> nut<00:01:49.810> they<00:01:50.320> taste

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
the composition of the nut they taste

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.289 
the composition of the nut they taste
different<00:01:50.920> they<00:01:51.340> have<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> different<00:01:51.729> texture

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
different they have a different texture

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.440 
different they have a different texture
they<00:01:52.539> get<00:01:52.689> much<00:01:52.899> more<00:01:53.140> sweet<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:55.210> makes

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
they get much more sweet and it makes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.690 
they get much more sweet and it makes
but<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.899> lot<00:01:55.929> more<00:01:56.289> easy<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:57.130> get<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
but not a lot more easy to get the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.359 
but not a lot more easy to get the
energy<00:01:58.179> out<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.569> net<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.799> whole<00:02:00.009> key<00:02:00.250> with

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
energy out of the net the whole key with

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.249 
energy out of the net the whole key with
increasing<00:02:00.880> your<00:02:00.970> energy<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:02.049> get<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
increasing your energy is to get the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.749 
increasing your energy is to get the
most<00:02:02.470> amount<00:02:02.679> of<00:02:02.860> energy<00:02:03.009> out<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.310> your<00:02:03.549> food

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
most amount of energy out of your food

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.490 
most amount of energy out of your food
was<00:02:03.970> using<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> least<00:02:04.720> amount<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:05.200> your<00:02:05.380> own

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
was using the least amount of your own

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.889 
was using the least amount of your own
body's<00:02:06.009> energy<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.030> by<00:02:07.149> soaking<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.720> that's

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
body's energy so by soaking it that's

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.270 
body's energy so by soaking it that's
exactly<00:02:08.319> what<00:02:08.500> we're<00:02:08.619> doing<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.039> much

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
exactly what we're doing it's much

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.430 
exactly what we're doing it's much
easier<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.759> your<00:02:09.940> digestive<00:02:10.420> system<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:11.349> have

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
easier on your digestive system you have

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.080 
easier on your digestive system you have
much<00:02:11.590> more<00:02:11.650> energy<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.580> food<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.030> you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
much more energy out of the food and you

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.250 
much more energy out of the food and you
don't<00:02:13.269> have<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> use<00:02:13.660> as<00:02:13.810> much<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.019> your<00:02:14.200> own

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
don't have to use as much of your own

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.620 
don't have to use as much of your own
body's<00:02:14.769> energy<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.450> perfect

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
body's energy so this is the perfect

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
body's energy so this is the perfect
snack<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.260> eat<00:02:17.319> while<00:02:17.380> you're<00:02:17.709> traveling<00:02:18.180> what
