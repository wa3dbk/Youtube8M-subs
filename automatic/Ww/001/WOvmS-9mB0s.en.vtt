what<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.250> would<00:02:16.340> suggest<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:17.180> first<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:17.840> cut

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
what I would suggest is first of all cut

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.710 
what I would suggest is first of all cut
those<00:02:18.410> big<00:02:18.830> portions<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.909> half<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.360> you'll<00:02:20.569> end

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
those big portions in half so you'll end

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.080 
those big portions in half so you'll end

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.500 
ice cream and the cereal layer soften up
a<00:02:33.980> bit<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.550> they're<00:02:34.700> pretty<00:02:34.910> good<00:02:35.150> but<00:02:35.390> it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
a bit so they're pretty good but it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.730 
a bit so they're pretty good but it's
