that card trooper that effect to go

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.099 
that card trooper that effect to go
through<00:04:07.189> and<00:04:07.969> I'm<00:04:08.299> not<00:04:08.510> shrink<00:04:08.689> feeling<00:04:08.989> as<00:04:09.079> a

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
through and I'm not shrink feeling as a

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.550 
through and I'm not shrink feeling as a
cost<00:04:09.379> because<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.959> can<00:04:12.109> choose<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.409> number

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
cost because you can choose a number

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.349 
cost because you can choose a number
just<00:04:12.739> then<00:04:13.639> send<00:04:13.939> that<00:04:14.239> many<00:04:14.840> i<00:04:16.239> don't<00:04:17.239> know
