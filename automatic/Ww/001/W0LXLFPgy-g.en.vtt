00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.240
 yes Hello people in this video you see a song about yourself 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.870
 the doxis4 the iPhone iPod Touch 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.809
 and a flu 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.939
 now identify a project 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.829
 according to Apple, there are 2 official docks for the iPhone 3g s 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.560
 and iPhone 4 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.779
 that will 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.859
 in my case the iPhone 3g 3gs village 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.780
 The iPhone is safe there 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 Brawn has the two typical connectors 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.059
 there is the same 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.059
 for Dallas iPhone 4 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 the disadvantage here 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.810
 that is not with retreat 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 put in the dock 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.820
 the second official variant Werder Universal Dock 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.060
 the quartet percentages several times as dues 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.770
 fit here now 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 for the iPhone 3g 3gs 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.640
 that could also stop there 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.140
 and then have 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 typical connections 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.080
 Then there was also a message that this accessory 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 I want to mean it and was developed on the iPhone 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.530
 although it may actually be everything 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.390
 the advantage here 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.700
 one can 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.860
 Take these clubs out again 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.530
 and then you can put the iPhone with a case in the dock 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.500
 then there is one more 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.480
 without official variant 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 namely 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 with everybody 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 with cousin OK 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.300
 that also works with as nationwide goes 3gs 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 and iPhone 4 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.869
 there you have it too 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 the typical time connections 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.699
 Take on the iPhone 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.309
 so much for the iPhone 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.309
 let's get to the iPod Touch 4g 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.959
 here there are, according to Apple 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.239
 an official variant 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.239
 that would be the universal dock 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.119
 Unfortunately I do not have that 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.119
 That's why it is so one-off bets 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.309
 works with the iPhone 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.629
 just set 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.559
 and then it works 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.369
 but there are also 2 and official variants 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.879
 the first one is back 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.699
 an elderly gentleman 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.989
 and then we stop here too 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.219
 the iPhone 3g 3gs there 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.840
 and certainly not Â«I have the iPhone 4 so that would be synonymous with 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.839
 iPod Touch 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.329
 you seeed here 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.509
 the iPad provides 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.629
 no problem 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.999
 here is just the disadvantage of the iPod Touch must be naked so may 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.249
 no Castor Norman Foster is not pure 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.399
 the same with the 3g 3gs or iPhone 4 Dog 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.999
 and this is there around forfeit samples 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.239
 freehand 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.239
 To make Hechtsheim 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.429
 mm we are already 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.659
 as far as Schmidt has the Albert Joh 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.659
 and finally we have a horse here 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:16.790
 there's something Apple 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.790
 an official variant that's Black Dog 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.999
 There you can have the old one 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.389
 reinstate office 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.389
 as a digital picture frame 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.590
 exceeded 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.699
 how to do that 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.830
 would like to be 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.520
 Brachmann, of course 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.520
 typical connections 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 Take the Bockhorn leash 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.409
 and that is the only official variant, there is no place 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.740
 Weidemann sees 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740
 in the sense of the balance it does not fit 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.759
 besides, one is from 3g 3gs or iPhone 4 dock 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.389
 have been the departmental chief of the iPad 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 Finally, I was a little extra 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.939
 and there are those 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.939
 Refrain Kerry for the iPod Touch 4g 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.900
 it does not necessarily have to be the color 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.779
 there's there 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.499
 a stand a block 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.240
 there was this 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.710
 There you got your iPod more iPhones 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.710
 to adjust 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.870
 Bohemian and 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.870
 or something else 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.449
 FaceTime has been 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.449
 so also possible 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.839
 or that does not work 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.869
 Sita be the clearest 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.169
 Eilfeld 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.169
 one stood 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.379
 too heavy 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.719
 what does it have to have been of these 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.029
 Vienna JU about 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.349
 the docks for the iPhone iPod Touch 4g 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.800
 and the iPad 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.189
 at the quiz spectators 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.189
 the first time people 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.399
