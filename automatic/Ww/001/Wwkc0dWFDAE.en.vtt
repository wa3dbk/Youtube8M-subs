00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 since 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.699
 hi everyone is sir 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 quinton we find ourselves today for 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.140
 a tutorial PS 2015 on the goalkeepers 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 it is true that not only the players of a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 game there are also two goalkeepers and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.909
 we'll see in this tutorial that it's 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 important to master the palette of 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.180
 goalkeeper has in addition a tutorial that me 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 due to heart because I was me 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 keeper for a few years when 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 I was younger so I'm going to you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 present in this tutorial everything that can 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 do the goalkeeper and I'm also going 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.530
 present you some tips 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 who can help you in some 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.039
 game situations we start with the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.869
 six meters you press round for 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 go get a good attacker from the 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.350
 head far ahead but you can play 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.729
 also short with 3 pay attention to this 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 that the attacker of the internet not the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.240
 especially online balloon is what you 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.429
 know that you can that you can 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 ride up the team block where the 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.390
 down here so here in this case 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.039
 we press one to lower 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.690
 the team block and you fast and safe and 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.670
 one to make it go up that can be 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.390
 useful to go up the block here you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 swing the ball in front with round if 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.970
 you want to play that we press you on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.049
 one and give you a little bit on the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 right stick you are bringing a 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.259
 defender near you and you press 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.899
 moreover it saves you an attacker 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.310
 intercepts the balloon then the exits 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.800
 it may be the most 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.450
 important tutorial you have to master the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920
 goaltender outings to make 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.330
 take out the goalkeeper you know it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.560
 all you have to press triangle but 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.479
 you have to press triangle at the right 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.800
 moment if you press too early you 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.060
 may come out too early and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.470
 the attacker is going to dawn you and if you 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.269
 get out too late he'll adjust you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.099
 in front of the goals so you really need it 

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:56.879
 you have to feel the game you need for that 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.539
 I play football 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.860
 in truth it can help on some on 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.450
 some situations you see there I 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.580
 take the guard out a little 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.289
 that they clog the angle of fire by 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.869
 against if I make it go out too soon is going 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.160
 it's not going to read flying that's my 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.510
 indulgence online I takes me 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 maybe one in five goals on 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.400
 rotten reminders of the guardian so it's 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.200
 important 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.580
 already revived on the sides do not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.670
 not raise in the same, even if you 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.050
 see a player demarcated in the game you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.670
 always restart on the sides so 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.080
 you understood the short stimulus these 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.370
 cross you can make a feint if 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.180
 you see that there is an attacker who is going 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.950
 intercept the ball 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.660
 pressing extra during the animation 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.100
 the stimulus 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 you can also press r1 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.310
 released balloons and have the ball 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.320
 in the feet against must package 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 attackers around us so I 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.840
 a little technique of dead rats for 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.340
 online players who have not been 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.960
 nice with you you put them a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.400
 little balloon in the air the defender 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.840
 the army of the head and therefore the guardian 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.490
 can take the ball in hand and he 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.100
 can keep the balloon so a little bit more 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.360
 a long time it saves time 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.420
 so manual guards by pressing 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 on the ace and r3 you control the guardian 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.520
 of goal so he makes the stops 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.920
 automatically there is no need 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.310
 to press keys on 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.630
 strikes 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.190
 it can be useful on free kicks 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.530
 as we saw just before they 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.730
 are placed well it can be useful too 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.620
 in the game but you really have to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.630
 to control the guardian and me personally I do not 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.100
 not much control over the corner by 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.580
 against that it's very important to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.320
 control 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.330
 if you do it if you do nothing 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.950
 the computer he will stay on his line 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.450
 he's going out not too far from the goals by 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.230
 against by mastering it he can go 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.000
 far far away 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.530
 and normally if you master your 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.010
 guardians on the corners he takes everything 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.240
 on corner and finally the penaltys with the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.560
 right stick you choose where you 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.900
 want the goalkeeper to dive so that's 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.100
 one this is the lottery one clearly there is 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.840
 does not need to press wheels or what 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.330
 that it is only to make the stop you 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.590
 can move the goalkeeper before shooting 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.840
 and you can even do a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.250
 landreau goes to ronaldinho but hey to 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.350
 your peril or with the aca not 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.890
 market here I hope it helped you 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.890
 see you
