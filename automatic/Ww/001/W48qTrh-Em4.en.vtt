00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
that probably was should have been the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.050 
that probably was should have been the
first<00:02:51.530> note<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:52.010> get<00:02:52.280> rid<00:02:52.460> of<00:02:52.520> those<00:02:52.730> like

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
mental things to the bottom and maybe

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.220 
mental things to the bottom and maybe
get<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:55.550> get<00:02:55.700> ENC<00:02:56.000> over<00:02:56.300> there<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:57.020> probably

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
get to get ENC over there that probably

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.110 
get to get ENC over there that probably
would<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.560> been<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.740> great<00:02:58.040> move<00:02:58.280> try<00:02:58.910> that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
would have been a great move try that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.720

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
very much there you go

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.599 
very much there you go
this<00:03:09.390> new<00:03:09.659> area<00:03:10.079> so<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:10.499> we're<00:03:11.069> close<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
this new area so then we're close to the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.640 
this new area so then we're close to the
we're<00:03:11.969> actually<00:03:12.060> close<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.900> final<00:03:13.349> boss

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
we're actually close to the final boss

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.910 
we're actually close to the final boss
fight<00:03:13.889> I<00:03:14.159> think<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:15.469> level<00:03:16.469> like<00:03:16.680> we've

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
fight I think this level like we've

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.449 
fight I think this level like we've
moved<00:03:17.129> we've<00:03:17.370> been<00:03:17.549> moving<00:03:17.730> fast<00:03:18.120> grows<00:03:19.459> Rick

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
moved we've been moving fast grows Rick

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.619 
moved we've been moving fast grows Rick
okay<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.829> first<00:03:23.069> one<00:03:23.249> is<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:24.030> metal<00:03:24.450> guy

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
okay so the first one is this metal guy

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.660 
okay so the first one is this metal guy
so<00:03:25.049> our<00:03:25.349> first<00:03:25.680> move<00:03:25.920> should<00:03:25.950> probably<00:03:26.400> have

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
so our first move should probably have

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.349 
so our first move should probably have
to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.969> with<00:03:27.780> these<00:03:27.989> metal<00:03:28.409> thingies<00:03:28.859> oh<00:03:29.359> I

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359
