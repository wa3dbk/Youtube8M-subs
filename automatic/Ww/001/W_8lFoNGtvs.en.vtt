00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
it is to stand still while shooting it's

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.610 
it is to stand still while shooting it's

moving opposed to someone that's moving
it's<00:03:14.810> pretty<00:03:15.049> obvious<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.500> know<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:16.280> one

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
it's pretty obvious I know but it's one

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.680 
it's pretty obvious I know but it's one
of<00:03:16.430> those<00:03:16.549> tips<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> lot<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.209> people<00:03:17.510> don't

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
of those tips that a lot of people don't

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.509 
of those tips that a lot of people don't
do<00:03:17.870> whenever<00:03:18.590> I'm<00:03:18.799> playing<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> game<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.459> I

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
do whenever I'm playing a game and I

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.370 
do whenever I'm playing a game and I
want<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.760> survive<00:03:20.030> as<00:03:20.359> long<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
want to survive as long as I can I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.050 
want to survive as long as I can I
normally<00:03:21.470> travel<00:03:22.190> with<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> outsides<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
normally travel with the outsides of the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.910 
normally travel with the outsides of the
map<00:03:23.359> this<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.140> those<00:03:24.230> tips<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> say

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
map this is one of those tips that I say

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.340 
map this is one of those tips that I say
all<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.370> time<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.269> helps<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:26.720> much<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.200> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
all the time but it helps so much if you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.289 
all the time but it helps so much if you
travel<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.829> outskirts<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.579> if<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.180> go

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
travel the outskirts like if you go

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.789 
travel the outskirts like if you go
around<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.810> map<00:03:30.019> instead<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.500> rushing

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
around the map instead of rushing

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.830 
around the map instead of rushing
through<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> middle<00:03:31.370> you'll<00:03:32.000> survive<00:03:32.329> so

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
through the middle you'll survive so

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.270 
through the middle you'll survive so
much<00:03:33.019> longer<00:03:33.290> because<00:03:33.590> you're<00:03:33.859> pretty<00:03:34.069> much

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
much longer because you're pretty much

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.190 
much longer because you're pretty much
avoiding<00:03:34.819> all<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.569> action<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.109> you're

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
avoiding all of the action and you're

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.710 
avoiding all of the action and you're
picking<00:03:36.500> off<00:03:36.590> people<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.549> least<00:03:38.000> expect<00:03:38.510> it

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
picking off people that least expect it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.050 
picking off people that least expect it
just<00:03:39.410> be<00:03:39.560> aware<00:03:39.799> when<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.130> use<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.549> tip<00:03:40.850> you

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
have to be patient because it might seem

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:43.900 
have to be patient because it might seem
like<00:03:42.799> you're<00:03:43.040> missing<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.370> all<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.609> kills

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
me if you start rushing and dying then

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.410

started using them I think a couple

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.940 
started using them I think a couple
years<00:05:16.790> ago<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.990> haven't<00:05:18.380> stopped<00:05:18.650> using

that sense they increase the length

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.590 
that sense they increase the length
which<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.160> turn<00:05:22.520> increases<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.300> range<00:05:23.450> of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
which in turn increases the range of

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.930 
which in turn increases the range of
motion<00:05:23.930> which<00:05:24.200> means<00:05:24.470> they<00:05:25.250> help<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.610> become

pretty crazy you wouldn't think that

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.520 
pretty crazy you wouldn't think that
increasing<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.030> stick<00:05:32.390> length<00:05:32.660> would<00:05:33.200> help

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
increasing the stick length would help

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.110 
increasing the stick length would help
