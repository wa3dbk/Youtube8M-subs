yes so if you've ever played my graph

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
yes so if you've ever played my graph
you<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.450> mining

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you would know that's to make a mining

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
you would know that's to make a mining
shaft<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.740> would<00:01:25.890> usually<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.549> allow<00:01:26.939> an

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
shaft you would usually have to allow an

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960 
shaft you would usually have to allow an
extra<00:01:27.540> block<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.200> head<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> take<00:01:29.640> three

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
blocks for every block you go down so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.880 
blocks for every block you go down so
you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.180> down<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you can go down like this but now you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
you can go down like this but now you
can<00:01:35.280> only<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> reduce<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.600> amount<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
can only you can reduce that amount to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
can only you can reduce that amount to
two<00:01:37.320> blocks<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.950> only<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.369> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
two blocks and you can only take this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
two blocks and you can only take this
one<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.290> one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one this one go down this one this one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.190 
one this one go down this one this one
go<00:01:40.680> down<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> oh<00:01:41.340> look<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.150> discovered<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> k
