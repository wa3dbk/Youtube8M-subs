00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 times the fun you can here at the start in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.310
 This video is again one 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.790
 new question and that is the question here 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.120
 from the moment where have man and that is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.789
 the question of marwin tapped no 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 clue said gÃ¶rke like resp 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.420
 what would it do with a home 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.590
 set up if you have a room and three 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.539
 to four thousand euros available 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.390
 So what would have made sense for us 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 good workout at home on the environment 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 fitness studio visit to be able to replace 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.059
 fits so synonymous for a home says 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 that's true, of course, what would I do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.420
 recommend if you really want to go home 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.250
 want to train first and that are 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 a few things and that's what you need 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 I do not believe 30 4000 euro 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 important is that you have a little space 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 I would definitely go for it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 recommend a flat bank the one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 maybe still can adjust diagonally 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 can happen or fall negative 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 can adjust 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.840
 in addition good set of 2 dumbbells so if 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.620
 It really goes up to 40 kilos maybe 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 35 40 kilo then reck or powertech with 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.559
 a barbell and quite 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.510
 of course do all the basic exercises 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 so you can just trade you 2 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 and a bank complete 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 then complete body workout can do 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.360
 Of course if it had a long order 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.820
 reckers all the basic exercises like 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.159
 Squats make crosslifting military 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.320
 row and then you are already one 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.430
 very well equipped at home then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080
 maybe even the possibility 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 to make little card is skipping rope 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.600
 always very good 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 And for winter it would be natural 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.110
 good if you have more money left over and huskies 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 ergometer or so spinning on 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.900
 zuzulegen 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 there is a lot going on then there is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 Of course a few minor things I 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.829
 Just show me my homepage 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 I'm also in every now and then 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.130
 few exercises at home and I show 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.110
 just someone with me briefly 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.439
 so right now if I really have to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.600
 want to train home here about it 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 because my little dogs mecke and that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 I have then stop next to mine 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.009
 dumbbells people trading system because 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.420
 up to 205 kg 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.740
 if you can afford it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.780
 of course a little more expensive too a good one 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.549
 thing then here I have only flat bank 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 which one can adjust so synonymous 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.159
 oblique and slightly negative has sega 150 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.360
 cost euro at profi trade.de and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.030
 then I have here for example 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.039
 I have a few medicine balls here 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 Another type and jump rope in the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.550
 Corner and yoga mats exercise ball ideal 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.170
 Of course that's the way things are 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.240
 a gym ball for example 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
 a bit of his abdominal exercises 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.800
 would like to vary at home or simply 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
 Do some stabilization exercises 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.940
 can this balance what you can 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.070
 then you can have nice too 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 yes she is always just such an inter 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.550
 Perform muscular training perfectly 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.590
 also for a few at exercises and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.360
 of course medicine balls just like that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.770
 little things how to really get the tree 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.480
 kicked off a bit for example 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.250
 usually wants to expand 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.710
 is really enough for a bank like this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.420
 which is a bit more 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.500
 weight if you then the possibility 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.520
 a place had power rack and tower 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.200
 rack and a barbell with more 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.000
 weight or weight is also a pull-up 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.890
 bar here is not as good pure 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.300
 The frame was not that stable, though 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
 a chin-up bar is also great 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.650
 that's enough, I think 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.950
 usually you do not need three to 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.050
 four thousand euro but with 1000 1500 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.150
 You can do that a lot 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.310
 My tip is always times 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.170
 Again , just have a look 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.820
 really if you have the opportunity 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.410
 to set something up for you or that 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.020
 you have to look for example on ebay 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.120
 also purely or often have in such ads 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.670
 yes so gym resolution or 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.100
 studios get the new equipment 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.690
 then put on bb older devices 1 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.720
 If you are really good and stable 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.400
 heavy professional weight bench or something 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.830
 you want to get along already partially 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.959
 203 euros a really stable is indeed profi 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.940
 suitable things also weights you can 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.050
 of course good bidders so look 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.700
 whenever you really you something 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.709
 would like to grow or an ergometer or 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.250
 spinning bike after need thing times 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.959
 ebay 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.850
 But there you can find quite a good thing 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.920
 and usually I would be enough 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.470
 also one and a half to 2000 euro monument 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.120
 yes that was actually supposed to be there 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.040
 really wanted to say as I said 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.959
 to go back home a bit 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.520
 I really do not want to and seriously 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.780
 Home now wants to train as big 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.910
 may also be easy 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.070
 Exercise ball high cube may be fine 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.270
 also keep fit for the road and yes me 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.860
 I hope I could answer the question a bit 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.870
 answer as I said you notice 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.180
 just dumbbells slaughter 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.620
 power dumbbell maybe chin up 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.910
 rod and then I could really get one 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.870
 studio training already too 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.000
 replace the house 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.620
 and yes as I said that is quite 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.209
 well, I think if you are on it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.000
 I'm out I hope I could 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.160
 as a bit ago 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.160
 enough stored of the day
