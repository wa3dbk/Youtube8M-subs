jerking around too much then you might

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.570 
jerking around too much then you might
have<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.959> adjust<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.620> positioning<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.250> one<00:03:56.459> of

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
have to adjust the positioning of one of

have to adjust the positioning of one of
these<00:03:56.700> frames<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:58.230> now<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> can<00:03:58.650> go<00:03:58.800> back<00:03:58.830> into

these frames so now I can go back into

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.060 
these frames so now I can go back into
my<00:03:59.340> button<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> movie<00:04:01.470> clip<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
add audio to this frame I need to create

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.540 
add audio to this frame I need to create
a<00:04:29.670> blank<00:04:30.000> keyframe<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:31.770> from<00:04:32.010> here<00:04:32.340> I

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
a blank keyframe and then from here I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.750 
a blank keyframe and then from here I
can<00:04:33.090> go<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.690> properties<00:04:34.170> panel<00:04:34.440> and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
can go up to the properties panel and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.150 
can go up to the properties panel and
choose<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.180> horse<00:04:36.540> whinny<00:04:36.870> sound<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.590> it

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.550 
choose the horse whinny sound and it
only<00:04:38.340> brings<00:04:38.580> up<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.060> sound<00:04:39.900> files<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.380> I've

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
only brings up the sound files that I've

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.210 
only brings up the sound files that I've
actually<00:04:40.860> loaded<00:04:41.400> into<00:04:41.880> my<00:04:42.090> library<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:43.220> now

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
actually loaded into my library and now

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.700 
actually loaded into my library and now
that<00:04:44.460> sound<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:45.060> on<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.540> downstate<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.560> let's

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
that sound is on the downstate so let's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.380 
that sound is on the downstate so let's
see<00:04:46.890> what<00:04:47.010> we've<00:04:47.160> got<00:04:47.190> going<00:04:47.400> we'll<00:04:48.090> go<00:04:48.210> back

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
see what we've got going we'll go back

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.010 
see what we've got going we'll go back
to<00:04:48.600> scene<00:04:48.810> 1<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:50.240> we'll<00:04:51.240> zoom<00:04:51.270> out<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:54.020> test

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
to scene 1 and we'll zoom out and test

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.520 
to scene 1 and we'll zoom out and test
and<00:04:56.090> now<00:04:57.090> when<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.300> roll<00:04:57.570> over<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:58.290> horse

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
and now when I roll over the horse

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.680 
and now when I roll over the horse
should<00:04:58.680> move<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.730> do<00:04:59.790> see<00:05:00.180> some<00:05:00.420> things

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
should move and I do see some things

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.630 
should move and I do see some things
that<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.900> might<00:05:01.140> want<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.440> tweak<00:05:01.680> there's<00:05:02.430> some

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
that I might want to tweak there's some

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.160 
that I might want to tweak there's some
weirdness<00:05:02.940> happening<00:05:03.570> there<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.020> looks

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
weirdness happening there so it looks

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.410 
weirdness happening there so it looks
like<00:05:04.320> I'm<00:05:04.470> gonna<00:05:04.830> need<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.220> position<00:05:05.760> this

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
like I'm gonna need to position this

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.930 
like I'm gonna need to position this
horse<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.140> bit<00:05:07.260> fine-tune<00:05:07.920> it<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:08.820> as
