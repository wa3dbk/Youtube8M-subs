got the golem package well you get these
in<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> separate<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.180> often<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.570> wasn't<00:01:33.810> exactly

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
in a separate so often I wasn't exactly

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.679 
in a separate so often I wasn't exactly
sure<00:01:34.369> when<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.729> getting<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.119> units<00:01:36.509> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
sure when I was getting these units or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
sure when I was getting these units or
why<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.900> believe<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.530> directly<00:01:37.920> related<00:01:38.040> to

seeing here I'm splitting off my
zerglings<00:02:14.440> that's<00:02:14.950> because<00:02:15.340> there's<00:02:15.550> not

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
zerglings that's because there's not

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
much detection on them in the game right

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.730 
much detection on them in the game right
now<00:02:18.250> there's<00:02:18.970> not<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:19.270> stuff<00:02:19.510> detection<00:02:20.080> for

now there's not much stuff detection for

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.040 
now there's not much stuff detection for
players<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.100> use<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.090> really<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:22.900> use

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
players to use so really you can use

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.140

this<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.320> your<00:02:23.500> advantage<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.220> send<00:02:25.030> out

it evolved I'm going to go and speed up
because<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> game<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.270> rather<00:02:46.480> long<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.990> you

controller<00:05:56.200> units<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.770> map<00:05:57.040> you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.730> in

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
controller units in that map you can in

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.860 
controller units in that map you can in
this<00:05:58.030> one<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.360> that's<00:05:58.510> one<00:05:58.660> of<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.840> things

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
four if you look at these units they've

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.420 
four if you look at these units they've
got<00:06:09.280> Q<00:06:09.730> w/e<00:06:10.420> are<00:06:10.990> for<00:06:11.650> path<00:06:11.980> of<00:06:12.190> wat

got Q w/e are for path of wat

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.270 
got Q w/e are for path of wat
earth-death<00:06:13.060> water<00:06:13.720> have<00:06:14.350> fire<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:14.950> path<00:06:15.100> of

earth-death water have fire and path of
storm<00:06:15.580> that<00:06:16.120> will<00:06:16.360> when<00:06:16.750> you<00:06:16.780> push<00:06:16.990> that

storm that will when you push that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.380 
storm that will when you push that
button<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.710> push<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.610> hockey<00:06:18.880> for<00:06:19.030> this<00:06:19.180> unit

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
button I push that hockey for this unit

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.880 
button I push that hockey for this unit
that<00:06:19.540> will<00:06:19.600> take<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:20.020> unit<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.620> this

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
that will take that unit to this

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.830 
that will take that unit to this
stationary<00:06:21.460> here<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.090> then<00:06:22.480> if<00:06:22.570> you<00:06:22.660> were<00:06:22.720> to

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
stationary here and then if you were to

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.020 
stationary here and then if you were to
push<00:06:23.020> combine<00:06:23.440> these<00:06:23.800> eNOS<00:06:24.040> rush<00:06:24.370> in<00:06:24.550> here<00:06:24.820> and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
push combine these eNOS rush in here and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.420 
push combine these eNOS rush in here and
try<00:06:25.600> to<00:06:25.690> combine<00:06:25.900> I<00:06:26.320> did<00:06:27.040> have<00:06:27.190> some<00:06:27.370> issues

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
try to combine I did have some issues

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.920 
try to combine I did have some issues
with<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:27.790> technically<00:06:28.300> there<00:06:28.900> are

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
with that technically there are

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.360 
with that technically there are
definitely<00:06:29.290> a<00:06:29.350> few<00:06:29.380> typing<00:06:29.800> glaciers<00:06:30.100> left<00:06:30.250> on

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
definitely a few typing glaciers left on

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.470 
definitely a few typing glaciers left on
the<00:06:30.460> snap<00:06:30.640> especially<00:06:31.060> in<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.180> combining

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
the snap especially in the combining

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.270 
the snap especially in the combining
area<00:06:31.840> but<00:06:31.960> overall<00:06:32.169> it<00:06:32.380> was<00:06:32.470> fairly<00:06:32.710> clean<00:06:33.070> and

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
area but overall it was fairly clean and

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.580 
area but overall it was fairly clean and
I<00:06:33.640> definitely<00:06:33.970> enjoyed<00:06:34.419> it<00:06:34.570> let's<00:06:35.410> go<00:06:35.530> ahead

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
I definitely enjoyed it let's go ahead

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.660 
I definitely enjoyed it let's go ahead
and<00:06:35.710> take<00:06:35.860> another<00:06:36.220> look

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
and take another look

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.400 
and take another look
this<00:06:36.760> is<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.000> flame<00:06:37.240> golem<00:06:37.540> as<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.690> result<00:06:38.110> this

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
this is the flame golem as a result this

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.070 
this is the flame golem as a result this
is<00:06:38.560> just<00:06:38.830> the<00:06:39.340> basic<00:06:39.760> flame<00:06:40.000> golem<00:06:40.420> I<00:06:40.600> did<00:06:40.960> not

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
is just the basic flame golem I did not

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.710 
is just the basic flame golem I did not
really<00:06:41.320> get<00:06:41.410> to<00:06:41.530> experience<00:06:41.620> more<00:06:42.550> golems<00:06:43.360> of

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
really get to experience more golems of

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.780 
really get to experience more golems of
a<00:06:43.870> more<00:06:44.050> advanced<00:06:44.500> level<00:06:44.800> because<00:06:45.160> I<00:06:45.370> simply

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
a more advanced level because I simply

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.000 
a more advanced level because I simply
didn't<00:06:46.090> get<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.300> that<00:06:46.390> point<00:06:46.570> in<00:06:46.780> this<00:06:46.900> game<00:06:47.010> it

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
didn't get to that point in this game it

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.350 
didn't get to that point in this game it
seems<00:06:48.190> like<00:06:48.310> it<00:06:48.370> takes<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.640> while<00:06:48.760> and<00:06:49.090> it<00:06:49.180> might

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
seems like it takes a while and it might

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.270 
seems like it takes a while and it might
very<00:06:49.390> well<00:06:49.690> be<00:06:49.810> bugged<00:06:50.110> right<00:06:50.290> now<00:06:50.470> overall

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
very well be bugged right now overall

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.160 
very well be bugged right now overall
though<00:06:51.490> this<00:06:51.700> maps<00:06:51.970> very<00:06:52.300> enjoyable<00:06:52.600> go<00:06:53.050> and

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
though this maps very enjoyable go and

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.600 
though this maps very enjoyable go and
slowed<00:06:53.380> down<00:06:53.560> as<00:06:53.770> I'm<00:06:53.860> starting<00:06:54.130> to<00:06:54.160> lag<00:06:54.340> quite

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
slowed down as I'm starting to lag quite

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.330 
slowed down as I'm starting to lag quite
a<00:06:54.640> bit<00:06:55.200> very<00:06:56.200> enjoyable<00:06:56.470> map<00:06:56.830> very<00:06:57.040> fun<00:06:57.250> to

here but again you're able to control
all<00:07:11.950> your<00:07:12.070> units<00:07:12.430> so<00:07:12.550> I'm<00:07:12.640> able<00:07:12.760> turn<00:07:13.210> them

this is actually a very successful as

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.480 
this is actually a very successful as
you<00:07:17.080> can<00:07:17.170> see<00:07:17.320> when<00:07:17.500> kills<00:07:17.680> arising<00:07:18.220> still

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
you can see when kills arising still
