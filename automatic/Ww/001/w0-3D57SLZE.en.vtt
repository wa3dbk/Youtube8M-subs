00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
coming in where you are building this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.390 
coming in where you are building this
locomotive<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> forecast<00:01:12.530> number<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.190> what

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
locomotive to a forecast number and what

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.950 
locomotive to a forecast number and what
I<00:01:13.430> think<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.790> really<00:01:13.940> neat<00:01:14.180> about<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.690> that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
I think is really neat about it is that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.719 
I think is really neat about it is that
the<00:01:15.260> orders<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.159> we're<00:01:16.280> going<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.430> get<00:01:16.580> for

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the orders that we're going to get for

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.580 
the orders that we're going to get for
that<00:01:16.760> cab<00:01:17.030> forward<00:01:17.390> are<00:01:17.780> gonna<00:01:17.960> outweigh<00:01:18.409> what

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
that cab forward are gonna outweigh what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.280 
that cab forward are gonna outweigh what
we're<00:01:18.710> gonna<00:01:18.799> have<00:01:18.890> for<00:01:19.070> supply<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:21.110> really

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
we're gonna have for supply so it really

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.170 
we're gonna have for supply so it really
sets<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.770> stage<00:01:21.979> for<00:01:22.040> what<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.729> build<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
sets the stage for what the build the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.260 
sets the stage for what the build the
order<00:01:23.420> program<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:24.080> which<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:25.150> limiting<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
order program is which is limiting the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.460 
order program is which is limiting the
amount<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.659> product<00:01:27.110> that's<00:01:27.260> in<00:01:27.380> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
point later they end up getting a trade

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.070 
point later they end up getting a trade
publication<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.909> here's<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> same<00:01:38.659> product

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
publication and here's the same product

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.380 
publication and here's the same product
that<00:01:39.110> they<00:01:39.290> paid<00:01:39.500> price<00:01:39.830> X<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:40.340> being<00:01:41.180> sold

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
that they paid price X for being sold

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.280 
that they paid price X for being sold
for<00:01:41.540> price<00:01:41.750> Y<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.400> cab<00:01:43.580> forwards<00:01:44.290> should

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
for price Y so the cab forwards should

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.510 
for price Y so the cab forwards should
be<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.409> pretty<00:01:45.619> exciting<00:01:45.860> piece<00:01:46.159> because

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
be a pretty exciting piece because

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.310 
be a pretty exciting piece because
they'll<00:01:46.670> be<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.880> limited<00:01:47.210> supply<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.990> hide<00:01:48.229> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
they'll be in limited supply and hide to

there will be more Road names in the
future<00:02:38.650> trying<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.830> focus<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.420> locomotives

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
