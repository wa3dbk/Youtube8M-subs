to get to the next level in an education
I<00:01:58.810> think<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> biggest<00:01:59.649> way<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.549> help<00:02:01.360> or

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
I think the biggest way that we help or

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.270 
I think the biggest way that we help or
hinder<00:02:01.810> students<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.409> whether<00:02:02.950> or<00:02:03.040> not<00:02:03.100> we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
hinder students is whether or not we

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.190 
hinder students is whether or not we
