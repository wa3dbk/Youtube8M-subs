and correct but then what I feel that
you<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.210> do<00:02:57.330> then<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.900> start<00:02:58.170> to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
you can do then is you can start to

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.710 
you can do then is you can start to
broaden<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.010> mind<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.540> that's<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
broaden your mind and that's the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
broaden your mind and that's the
wonderful<00:03:00.930> thing<00:03:01.410> about<00:03:01.440> hairdressing<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
wonderful thing about hairdressing and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
wonderful thing about hairdressing and
that's<00:03:02.850> why<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> wanted<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.660> spend<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.080> time

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
that's why I wanted to spend this time

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
that's why I wanted to spend this time
doing<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.830> patterns<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.340> sections<00:03:05.730> because

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
doing the patterns and sections because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.810 
doing the patterns and sections because
to<00:03:06.600> me<00:03:06.720> they're<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.080> important<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.250> also<00:03:08.430> for

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
to me they're so important but also for

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.580 
to me they're so important but also for
this<00:03:08.940> reason<00:03:09.390> alone<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.170> they<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
this reason alone that they are the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.160 
this reason alone that they are the
basics<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> start<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.210> starting<00:03:12.960> block

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
basics to start in the starting block

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.530 
basics to start in the starting block
for<00:03:13.470> letting<00:03:14.250> your<00:03:14.370> creativity<00:03:14.880> flow<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> if

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
for letting your creativity flow so if

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.010 
for letting your creativity flow so if
we<00:03:18.660> take<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.020> down<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:21.239> for<00:03:21.420> example<00:03:21.870> we've

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
we take this down so for example we've

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.120 
we take this down so for example we've
done<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> disconnection<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.950> out

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
done a disconnection here and this out

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.680 
done a disconnection here and this out
the<00:03:26.250> way<00:03:26.400> let's<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.820> spin<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.209> around<00:03:27.239> early

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
the way let's just spin you around early

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.800 
the way let's just spin you around early
so<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.410> side<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.660> then

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so we can just see the side you can then

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.630 
so we can just see the side you can then
do<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.320> take<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.650> down<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:35.520> can

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
do is you can take this down and you can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.890 
do is you can take this down and you can
work<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.000> across<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:39.390> can<00:03:39.570> look<00:03:39.750> at

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
work it across you can look at

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.340 
work it across you can look at
connecting<00:03:40.489> this<00:03:41.489> side<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.090> bring<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.110> up

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
connecting this side and bring it up

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.870 
connecting this side and bring it up
remove<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.070> little<00:03:44.250> bit<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> weight<00:03:44.640> from<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
remove a little bit of weight from the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.080 
remove a little bit of weight from the
front<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.860> then<00:03:46.860> although<00:03:47.550> that's<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
front and then although that's the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
front and then although that's the
disconnection<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.590> connect<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.130> you

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
disconnection you can connect it if you

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.390 
disconnection you can connect it if you
want<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.850> take<00:03:51.720> all<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.989> out<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.310> it

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
want to and take all that out so that it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.840 
want to and take all that out so that it
falls<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> wonderful<00:03:56.580> thing

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
falls and that is the wonderful thing

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.430 
falls and that is the wonderful thing
about<00:03:57.060> hairdressing<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.900> my<00:03:58.290> opinion<00:04:00.440> like

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
about hairdressing in my opinion like

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.840 
about hairdressing in my opinion like
the<00:04:01.560> section<00:04:01.890> we're<00:04:02.040> going<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.280> looking<00:04:02.700> at

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
the section we're going to be looking at

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.680 
the section we're going to be looking at
now<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.410> horseshoe<00:04:04.950> section<00:04:05.690> it's

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
now is the horseshoe section it's

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.350 
now is the horseshoe section it's
basically<00:04:07.230> took<00:04:07.530> from<00:04:07.709> recession<00:04:08.100> area<00:04:08.610> to

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
basically took from recession area to

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.660 
basically took from recession area to
recession<00:04:09.870> area<00:04:10.170> all<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.650> way<00:04:10.890> around<00:04:11.370> and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
recession area all the way around and

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.380 
recession area all the way around and
like<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:13.190> section<00:04:14.190> that's<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.760> radial<00:04:15.150> from

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
like the section that's the radial from

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.150 
like the section that's the radial from
the<00:04:15.510> crown<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> lower<00:04:16.799> area<00:04:16.950> that

the crown to the lower area that

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.740 
the crown to the lower area that
separates<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> back<00:04:17.940> from<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.180> front<00:04:18.600> this

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
separates the back from the front this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.800 
separates the back from the front this
is<00:04:18.959> separating<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.650> bottom<00:04:20.100> from<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> top

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
is separating the bottom from the top

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.380 
is separating the bottom from the top
it's<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.900> great<00:04:22.080> section<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.680> use<00:04:22.890> when<00:04:23.430> doing

have<00:04:33.689> a<00:04:33.719> a<00:04:34.020> reference<00:04:34.710> point<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.189> be<00:04:35.310> able<00:04:35.400> to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
have a a reference point to be able to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.739 
have a a reference point to be able to
connect<00:04:35.909> to<00:04:36.469> any<00:04:37.469> angle<00:04:37.919> you<00:04:37.949> like<00:04:38.189> so<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:39.599> way

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
connect to any angle you like so the way

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.800 
connect to any angle you like so the way
that<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.139> a<00:04:40.650> horseshoe<00:04:41.550> section<00:04:42.389> for<00:04:42.659> just

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
that I do a horseshoe section for just

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.350 
that I do a horseshoe section for just
spin<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.319> around<00:04:43.349> is<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.699> get<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> reference

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
spin you around is you get the reference

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.360 
spin you around is you get the reference
point<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.490> recession<00:04:47.490> area<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:47.999> you<00:04:48.569> just

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
point of the recession area and you just

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.170 
point of the recession area and you just
take<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.520> round<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.759> then<00:04:56.759> what<00:04:56.879> you<00:04:56.969> do<00:04:57.150> is

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
take it round and then what you do is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.959 
take it round and then what you do is
you<00:04:57.479> just<00:04:57.860> come<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.039> up<00:04:59.219> obviously<00:04:59.460> with<00:04:59.849> the

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
you just come this up obviously with the

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.969 
you just come this up obviously with the
hair<00:05:00.180> being<00:05:00.419> wet<00:05:00.659> it<00:05:01.050> would<00:05:01.229> be<00:05:01.319> a<00:05:01.349> lot<00:05:01.560> easier

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
hair being wet it would be a lot easier

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.219 
hair being wet it would be a lot easier
and<00:05:02.039> a<00:05:02.159> lot<00:05:02.310> more<00:05:02.340> manageable<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:03.990> comb

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
and a lot more manageable you just comb

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.619 
and a lot more manageable you just comb
that<00:05:04.379> up<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.949> you<00:05:05.310> would<00:05:05.969> click<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.389> they're

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
that up and you would click that they're

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.209 
that up and you would click that they're
following<00:05:07.620> your<00:05:07.979> line<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:09.650> would<00:05:10.650> continue

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
following your line you would continue

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.969 
following your line you would continue
to<00:05:11.250> work<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.879> all<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.180> way<00:05:12.689> around<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:15.979> you

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
to work it all the way around so you

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.070 
to work it all the way around so you
eventually<00:05:17.279> get<00:05:17.789> round<00:05:18.569> to<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.560> other

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
eventually get round to the other

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.110 
eventually get round to the other
recession<00:05:22.080> area<00:05:22.409> which<00:05:23.279> is<00:05:23.490> there<00:05:24.439> and<00:05:26.120> then

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
recession area which is there and then

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.290 
recession area which is there and then
you<00:05:27.150> just<00:05:27.240> scoop<00:05:27.719> all<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.080> hair<00:05:28.289> up<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.909> clip

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
you just scoop all this hair up and clip

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.610 
you just scoop all this hair up and clip
it<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.659> that<00:05:31.469> is<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.310> horseshoe<00:05:32.789> section<00:05:36.620> all

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
it and that is the horseshoe section all

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.600 
it and that is the horseshoe section all
right<00:05:37.770> so<00:05:37.830> we're<00:05:37.979> going<00:05:38.069> to<00:05:38.129> be<00:05:38.219> looking<00:05:38.460> at

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
right so we're going to be looking at

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.969 
right so we're going to be looking at
now<00:05:38.759> is<00:05:38.789> sectioning<00:05:39.779> sectioning<00:05:40.589> patterns

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
now is sectioning sectioning patterns

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.429 
now is sectioning sectioning patterns
we've<00:05:41.819> done<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.029> lot<00:05:42.210> on<00:05:42.360> part<00:05:42.659> and<00:05:42.870> we've

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790 
which I would follow that all the way

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.879 
which I would follow that all the way
through<00:07:27.240> and<00:07:27.479> perform<00:07:28.229> one<00:07:28.380> of<00:07:28.410> the<00:07:28.530> haircuts

through and perform one of the haircuts

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.040 
through and perform one of the haircuts
in<00:07:29.010> the<00:07:29.130> range<00:07:29.310> so<00:07:30.060> that<00:07:30.090> is<00:07:30.360> the<00:07:30.510> importance

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
in the range so that is the importance

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.279 
in the range so that is the importance

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:34.289 
of very nice neat sectioning but most

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.409 
of very nice neat sectioning but most
importantly<00:07:34.889> having<00:07:35.639> a<00:07:35.700> guideline<00:07:36.150> that<00:07:36.180> you

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419
