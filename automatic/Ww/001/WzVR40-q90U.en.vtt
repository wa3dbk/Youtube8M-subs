 new release for windows phone 7 the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.740
 important because we have 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.810
 listened to what the movies that gods 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.310
 consumers launch windows phone 7 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.960
 we have implemented all the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.760
 functionality that was there today 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.039
 most requested to do a 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.349
 simple example balls has always been there 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.329
 said in pair feist you have not had 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.949
 therefore they keep copies based on the launch 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.289
 in the next four weeks the couple 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.989
 will be available for windows phone 7 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.609
 to follow in the coming months will come 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.960
 also implemented as a system of 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.739
 browsing and internet internet 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.809
 explorer 9 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.030
 Yesterday you probably saw in 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.399
 demo the advantage of new trescore 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.469
 than these other short web browsing 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.639
 and the experience is absolutely 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.609
 unbelievable 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.989
 we then listened to the next because 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.050
 told us yesterday it was final there 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.059
 you said there was a smart one 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.620
 a multitasking multi - pocket smart 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.540
 would emit its own multitasking well 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.630
 we have simply implemented 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.700
 clicking holding holding the button 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.310
 back in 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.899
 pressed for the future could find 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.920
 among the problems multitasking is 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.979
 therefore open the possibility of 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.780
 listen to songs browse that email or 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.880
 in any case , any application April 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.259
 that of a third party others 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.439
 implementation and fundamental that is 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.740
 was made and will be updated in 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.560
 second part of 2011 is the possibility 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.750
 to be able to use office offset ever 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.219
 few more conditionality arises 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.869
 requests used by the consumer who 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.939
 buy this kind of device with this one 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.200
 only sky dragons operating system will be 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.799
 You can use the whole package 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.810
 office 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.310
 so even for most users me 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.780
 siemens and respect an altar of the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.149
 phone and consumer 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.299
 we have implemented this sleeve that 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.060
 he was the other one on the market today 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.709
 worldwide there are 10 deputies present with 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 windows phone seven the three canadair 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.560
 four manufacturers who have 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 married the windows phone project 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 htc are and what you have some specimens 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.000
 available on the American market 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.549
 lg optimus 7 is the product of the launch 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 main for microsoft italy in 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.709
 partnership with vodafone in October a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.599
 follow a product as a user 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.629
 purely business given the keyboard 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.040
 qwerty as the dell venue product 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.420
 which could also be made available for 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.349
 Italian market 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.000
 the htc mozart produced with a target that 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.590
 probably a little more feminine like 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.940
 the tech and vice articles is more a 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 blow 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.600
 sophisticated but it's like the car face 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.040
 the samsung omnia is absolutely intuitive 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.650
 7 which because of the characteristics 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.100
 of the Korean house he always has 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.240
 strong having a super amoled screen 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.360
 highlights the potential of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.500
 operating system itself and the last of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.890
 vice present on the Italian market 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.990
 lacquered 7 the only device with resolution 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.970
 hd with a larger screen allows us 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.290
 to display used for this 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.390
 operating system unit at most 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.580
 of its effectiveness 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.680
 this for the libya of all products 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.330
 foreigners seem to be the world's first 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.070
 something that catches your eye immediately 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.680
 however note the type of face 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.020
 then four houses to this trici but 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.700
 I don't always do the same because 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.000
 eighth matrices in the year by identifying 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.950
 a simple dynamic in the common together 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 to look at the other increasing therefore if 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
 you bought it in the product in the g1 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.980
 htc and you are a microsoft user you have to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.900
 find the same user experience a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.190
 depending on the hardware repeats to buy 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.370
 this is fundamental for us 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.390
 what to say yesterday was also rita 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.250
 bear behind yesterday 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.410
 the appearance prints the announcement of 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.650
 partnership between nokia and max a part c 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.180
 more important because it still testifies 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
 once as far as the hydrogen house 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.860
 legal on the global market has decided to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.010
 marry windows phone 7 is the platform 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.600
 of southern marble for everything invented the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.400
 main platform for the market 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.130
 nokia smartphone 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.410
 this in addition to telling us anyway 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.360
 of pride for the development of 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 our platform will allow anyway 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.380
 to extend interest in ours 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.970
 platform steps on a user with the 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.740
 probably average spending capacity 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.390
 so I don't pay high retirement 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.310
 as it has been until today but also 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.900
 will be able to target a consumer 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.290
 a little more attentive to their skills than 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.810
 The testimony is large spending time 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.520
 that the ecosystem he never created 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.690
 around windows phone 7 of that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.430
 developer system of that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.890
 System of system operators 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.010
 in fact, the manufacturers are working 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.180
 with nokia htc of samsung and lg we will go 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.700
 continue to develop a line of 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.000
 also produced the second part of 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.650
 this year and we are therefore Microsoft has 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.840
 a new player on the market 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.310
 maicon 7 with windows phone 7 becomes the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.020
 reference operating system for 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.810
 all the main players on the market 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.650
 of smartphones and this I thought that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.730
 is an important turning point for 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.730
 our company on the powerful
