and so I put here on pad 8 yep and now
we're<00:06:08.490> going<00:06:08.640> to<00:06:08.700> sample<00:06:09.060> from<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.930> sample

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
we're going to sample from the sample

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.160 
we're going to sample from the sample
can<00:06:10.470> yourself<00:06:10.620> yep<00:06:11.370> yep<00:06:11.790> yep<00:06:12.120> yep<00:06:12.390> and<00:06:12.900> now

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
can yourself yep yep yep yep and now

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.550 
can yourself yep yep yep yep and now
we're<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:13.770> sample<00:06:14.070> from<00:06:14.730> himself<00:06:15.630> so

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
we're going to sample from himself so

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.660 
we're going to sample from himself so
we're<00:06:16.650> gonna<00:06:16.770> actually<00:06:16.950> do<00:06:17.310> it<00:06:17.400> right<00:06:17.550> here

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
we're gonna actually do it right here

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.260 
we're gonna actually do it right here
the<00:06:17.820> microphone<00:06:18.300> directly<00:06:18.840> into<00:06:19.500> our<00:06:19.530> SP<00:06:20.270> 606

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
the microphone directly into our SP 606

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.540 
the microphone directly into our SP 606
and<00:06:22.230> I<00:06:22.290> can<00:06:22.440> place<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.890> of<00:06:23.040> course<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.400> think

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
and I can place that of course I think

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:36.620 
and I can place that of course I think
we<00:06:23.640> want<00:06:23.820> to<00:06:23.880> do<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.910> we<00:06:36.000> take<00:06:36.210> that<00:06:36.240> pattern

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
we want to do and we take that pattern

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.830 
we want to do and we take that pattern
stick<00:06:37.260> it<00:06:37.350> into<00:06:37.470> our<00:06:37.770> sequence<00:06:38.430> or<00:06:39.360> take<00:06:39.660> that

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
stick it into our sequence or take that

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.050 
stick it into our sequence or take that
actual<00:06:40.230> samples<00:06:40.710> into<00:06:40.920> our<00:06:41.070> pattern<00:06:41.760> and

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
actual samples into our pattern and

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.630 
actual samples into our pattern and
we're<00:06:42.360> good<00:06:42.510> to<00:06:42.540> go
