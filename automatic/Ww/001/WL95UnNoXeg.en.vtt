00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.109
 close to umbrella this is a curious 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.680
 invention allows that when a 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.350
 person is cut his hair does not fall to the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.470
 floor maybe one of the most inventions 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.660
 stupid but at the same time better 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.900
 sales is having is a way 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.780
 simple to pick hair that is cut 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.869
 to then either sell it or 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.230
 throw it in the trash we can see a photo 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.880
 of this curious invention that the truth is 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.840
 that I had never seen him before and 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.149
 surely not you and that good 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.780
 if they have a good reception, surely 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.530
 will end up extending especially for 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 those who cut their hair at home 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.649
 let's say 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 in hairdressing it would be weirder to see it but 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 at home when you cut your hair to your 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 son or your daughter or some member of the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 family look very good at not putting everything 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.839
 the ground full of hair let's say that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.149
 removes the need to sweep and pass the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.159
 vacuum cleaner the size of the neck is 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.950
 fits comfortably with a zipper 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.390
 and it's easy to save it because it also 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.640
 fold 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.920
 you can also be given another 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 type of uses but let's go as you can see 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.290
 it's an invention that's a bit bullshit 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.310
 but do not be surprised if you see that 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 in a while 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.770
 this invention triumphs and starts to 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 sold all over the world because they are 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.619
 this kind of thing that apparently 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 they do not represent anything but then they finish 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.440
 becoming famous and giving a lot of money 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.620
 to the creators 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.720
 we will see how this new 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.670
 invention and we'll see if he has the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.120
 enough repercussion to be made 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.120
 famous
