sort of equalizer to maybe turn up the
treble<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> little<00:02:58.549> bit<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.030> would<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.540> play<00:02:59.660> a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
treble a little bit I would just play a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.630 
treble a little bit I would just play a
little<00:02:59.900> bit<00:03:00.049> of<00:03:00.140> black<00:03:00.319> ops<00:03:00.470> with<00:03:00.709> them<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.099> it

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
little bit of black ops with them and it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.940 
little bit of black ops with them and it
was<00:03:01.760> okay<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.110> was<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.709> said<00:03:03.860> it

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
was okay but it was like I said it

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
was okay but it was like I said it
sounded<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.340> muffle<00:03:04.610> there<00:03:04.730> wasn't

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
sounded kind of muffle there wasn't

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.110 
sounded kind of muffle there wasn't
enough<00:03:05.150> trouble<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:05.720> treble<00:03:06.349> with<00:03:06.590> them<00:03:06.739> so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
enough trouble with treble with them so

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.339 
enough trouble with treble with them so
they're<00:03:08.120> okay<00:03:08.390> headphones<00:03:08.780> another<00:03:09.049> thing

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
they're okay headphones another thing

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.410 
they're okay headphones another thing
after<00:03:10.010> wearing<00:03:10.190> like<00:03:10.519> 15<00:03:10.940> minutes<00:03:11.090> or<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.329> half

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
after wearing like 15 minutes or a half

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.509 
after wearing like 15 minutes or a half
hour<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:12.680> go<00:03:12.799> over<00:03:12.889> your<00:03:13.069> ears<00:03:13.220> here<00:03:13.280> and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
hour they go over your ears here and

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.650 
hour they go over your ears here and
they<00:03:13.579> start<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.910> get<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:14.150> hot<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
they start to get really hot and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.210 
they start to get really hot and
uncomfortable<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.319> kind<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> sticky<00:03:15.980> if<00:03:16.100> you

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
uncomfortable and kind of sticky if you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.830 
uncomfortable and kind of sticky if you
sweat<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> little<00:03:16.639> bit<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.450> that's<00:03:17.630> another

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
sweat a little bit so that's another

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.750 
sweat a little bit so that's another
downside<00:03:18.109> this<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> leather<00:03:19.160> material

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
downside this is like a leather material

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.190 
downside this is like a leather material
it's<00:03:19.880> not<00:03:20.030> like<00:03:20.150> cloths<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.780> think<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.049> this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
it's not like cloths I think if this

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.059 
it's not like cloths I think if this
would<00:03:21.319> have<00:03:21.410> been<00:03:21.440> more<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.799> cloth-like

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
would have been more of a cloth-like

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.220 
would have been more of a cloth-like
material<00:03:22.359> they<00:03:23.359> wouldn't<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:23.900> hot<00:03:24.079> and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
material they wouldn't get so hot and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.229 
material they wouldn't get so hot and
sweaty<00:03:24.470> against<00:03:24.769> your<00:03:24.950> ears<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.760> don't

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.150 
sweaty against your ears but I don't
