are at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show and
we've<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.790> had<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> world<00:00:15.299> premiere<00:00:15.809> of

we've just had the world premiere of
this<00:00:16.289> latest<00:00:16.859> next-generation<00:00:17.369> concept<00:00:18.270> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
this latest next-generation concept is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320 
this latest next-generation concept is
called<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> CM<00:00:19.350> EF<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:20.430> look<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
called the CM EF just look at it what a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.230 
called the CM EF just look at it what a
cracker<00:00:21.650> design<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> key<00:00:23.609> part<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
cracker design was the key part of this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
cracker design was the key part of this
car<00:00:24.510> during<00:00:24.869> its<00:00:25.109> development<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:25.769> wanted

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
car during its development they wanted

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
car during its development they wanted
this<00:00:26.340> car<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.449> efficient<00:00:28.019> through<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
this car to be as efficient through the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.089 
this car to be as efficient through the
air<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.590> possible

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
air as possible

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.500 
air as possible
in<00:00:29.220> fact<00:00:29.730> they've<00:00:29.849> got<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> drag<00:00:30.300> coefficient

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
in fact they've got the drag coefficient

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.490 
in fact they've got the drag coefficient
down<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:32.420> 0.26<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.960> means<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
down to 0.26 and that means that this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.799 
down to 0.26 and that means that this
car<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.739> literally<00:00:35.399> cut<00:00:35.969> through<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> wind

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
car just literally cut through the wind

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959 
car just literally cut through the wind
and<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> didn't<00:00:37.620> compromise<00:00:38.129> any<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.820> its

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and that didn't compromise any of its

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.450 
and that didn't compromise any of its
design<00:00:39.329> notice<00:00:39.840> striking<00:00:40.350> looks<00:00:40.590> helped<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
design notice striking looks helped that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.830 
design notice striking looks helped that
figure<00:00:41.760> along<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.719> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
figure along and that's what this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
figure along and that's what this
sloping<00:00:43.410> roofline<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.430> unusual<00:00:45.180> rear

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
sloping roofline and it's unusual rear
