00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.730 
nothing and in a recent hot hatch test
we<00:01:33.960> said<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
we said that this was one of the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
we said that this was one of the
greatest<00:01:34.979> hot<00:01:35.250> hatches<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.729> time<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
greatest hot hatches of all time so so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.480 
greatest hot hatches of all time so so
as<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.049> say<00:01:37.170> Evo<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> combination<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
as I say Evo we have a combination of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.950 
as I say Evo we have a combination of
cars<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.090> loaned<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> us<00:01:39.479> by<00:01:39.600> press

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
cars that are loaned to us by press

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
cars that are loaned to us by press
offices<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.560> run<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> long<00:01:41.130> period<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
offices that we run for a long period of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
offices that we run for a long period of
time<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.060> our<00:01:42.240> own<00:01:42.270> cars<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.840> well

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
time and we have our own cars as well

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
time and we have our own cars as well
now<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.829> helpless<00:01:44.220> car<00:01:44.549> enthusiasts

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
now we're all helpless car enthusiasts

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
now we're all helpless car enthusiasts
and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> probably<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I think this is probably this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
and I think this is probably this
probably<00:01:47.729> epitomizes<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> our

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
probably epitomizes that this is our

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
probably epitomizes that this is our
staff<00:01:49.290> writers<00:01:49.740> Clio<00:01:50.040> Williams<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.700> an

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
lag system and I wasn't plumbed in for

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.880 
lag system and I wasn't plumbed in for
the<00:03:12.430> road<00:03:12.609> car<00:03:13.049> but<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.140> was<00:03:14.230> prepared<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the road car but it was prepared and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.379 
the road car but it was prepared and
built<00:03:15.129> so<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.640> rally<00:03:15.819> teams<00:03:16.060> could<00:03:16.239> get

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
built so that the rally teams could get

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.909 
built so that the rally teams could get
hold<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> car<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.079> plumb<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.410> all<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
hold of the car of plumb it all in and

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.729 
hold of the car of plumb it all in and
you'd<00:03:18.760> have<00:03:18.849> an<00:03:19.000> anti<00:03:19.209> lag<00:03:19.359> system<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.989> yeah

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
you'd have an anti lag system so yeah
