00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello and welcome to phone hours 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 for this introductory video about 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 custom accessories that you can 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 find on our website phone mer.fr so 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.890
 before you explain a little 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 the set of choices of possible I 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 present you some results that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.890
 is ultimately what interests 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.420
 the most the client so here here is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.849
 it's like asking a customer so 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 for a cuvée the axé note 2 it was a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 picture of a tag there you have the picture by 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 example of one of a table is here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 it was plates that were made 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 drawings lead an investigation 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 printed it was for funding 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 a dune bd called most of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.860
 body you also have on an ace 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.960
 you see where I hide the face because 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449
 we do not necessarily have the right to show it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 since it's pictures here are two 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.329
 clients so I'm going to go directly 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 or different choices available to you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.260
 so you have the rigid shell that is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.780
 the hull the hull first price the hull 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.729
 the support of the most simple you 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.960
 then go the soft shell the coke 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.240
 said and interchangeable and then 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 the study of which on the rigid hull it is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 a hull all that is plastic 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 pvc all that is more classic and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 which exists in several colors so the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 room and black dress she exists in white 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.909
 there you have it in transparent and he 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.049
 also exists little different from 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.030
 different colours 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 so that's according to the models 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.259
 the principle is con to come so 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 print this aluminum plate 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.869
 we will come hot transferred your 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 photo and then pasted this plate on 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.320
 on the hull exactly the same principle 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.700
 for the soft shell 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.799
 so here we go alliance or his 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 matter actually it's the mini gene that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.560
 allows him and absorb shocks in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.170
 fall of your phone 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.600
 the advantage is also that here a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.509
 little back that allows not only 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 hold the phone well but also 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.170
 to come back on the on the screen on the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.799
 before whom does that when we pose the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 flat phone the screen is fine and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.040
 well preserved as you can see 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.600
 this is for us the spawn iphone 5 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 it's a soup is there 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.810
 actually there is a little back on 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.830
 the front so that allows for good 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.650
 protected 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.140
 your phone here so you have 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.510
 easy to be interchangeable 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 so that's it allows you to come 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 not stick the plate in fact we come 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.540
 inserted a plaque like this site 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.830
 then we come to put his phone 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 so like these and with another and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.810
 well closed from the hull over 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.210
 I'm not mistaken sense is there and it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.550
 allows to change the plate 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.650
 as many times as we want both 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.490
 plates next game clis the hull I 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.830
 replace the plate 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.260
 it allows to have several hulls to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.330
 lower costs on the sides 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 interchangeable is shells too 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.540
 with some particular impression 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 on the packs different a little bit more 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 expensive because they are actually before 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.740
 says hd ie there is actually 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 it's a contrast developer is 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.150
 funny and it helps to have the nuts well 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.560
 deep and a little more contrast a 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.730
 little more shine so printing 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 is a little friendlier than the others 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.610
 especially if you have a lot of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.600
 contracts it's a lot of black got 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.489
 is black I advise you rather 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.209
 go on hulls like these 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.790
 only on standard print hulls 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.100
 you then have the cases which 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.040
 transfer of wallet cases back 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.420
 and black grained faux leather you have 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.489
 a hard shell inside for good 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.170
 maintain your phone you have a 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.360
 storage for credit cards and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
 loyalty cards business cards 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.930
 what can help you when you 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.790
 go out with your phone a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.010
 magnetic closure and on the advanced 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.019
 part that will come personalized who 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.810
