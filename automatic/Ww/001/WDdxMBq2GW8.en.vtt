00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.850
 the bulle timeslot is really nothing 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.020
 another from a frozen picture where 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.370
 you can shoot with 50 cameras at the same time 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 then you can be the protagonist 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.590
 Formed page actually times for 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.269
 the broadcast summer challenge produced 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.309
 the swiss radio and television srf 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.010
 with the help of canon schweiz two 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.300
 elaborate bullet time shows in action 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.970
 there were 50 canon eos-1d iks cameras for 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 me as a director is of course great 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.190
 from a project to push this forward 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 can it's a fantastic job when 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.979
 I imagine that like that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.049
 but ultimately the technical 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.049
 effort behind it is enormous 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.850
 and it is getting bigger than me 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.430
 For example, I had introduced myself 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 Today the camera unpacking star 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.490
 us more and more on the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.510
 ground after such a sea of ​​cameras 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.310
 spread this 1dx that's that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.840
 flagship of canon the most expensive 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.260
 camera you have at all 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:41.360
 Photo section and the work is one 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:43.250
 dream i hate the op have the settings 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.780
 the camera made we do not have to 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.630
 only decide in which quality 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.820
 we take the pictures we have too 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 with other attitudes us 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.110
 For example, ex factory must decide 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.100
 you can do that after a minute 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.500
 automatically from the course must me 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 prevent 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.310
 the cameras are mounted on the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.950
 really great Krems and tal heat and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 must be aligned exactly 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.960
 that means the horizon has to be with everyone 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.030
 camera exactly in the same place because 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.970
 otherwise the picture jumps we do yes 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.850
 actually 50 photos and the 50 photos 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.190
 continue as a movie 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.720
 the action is frozen 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.050
 that's actually the effect 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.050
 offspring 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.340
 the 50 cameras will be with us again 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.530
 the fan trigger socket connected with it 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.010
 one then the camera at the same time 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.909
 can trigger 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:47.019
 hope it will be a cool yes otherwise 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:48.250
 many people are disappointed we are in Bern 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.530
 more precisely at the aare 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.450
 beautiful weather we have now 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.810
 our 50 us 1dx together with 24 70 mm 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.540
 objective 28 aperture we have 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.169
 built on the 20 meter long way 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.269
 the 50 km are on a single point 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:10.569
 aligned so that we have an effect 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.939
 get what it almost looks like 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.389
 we with a camera around the person 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.389
 rumfahren 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.210
 we do not just see one completely here 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.100
 new sport probably here in 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.140
 bender and invented was namely the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.940
 bungee surfing but we see here 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.800
 also one for the Swiss are 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.680
 completely new production way namely 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.360
 these so-called old time shows and me 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.460
 I am convinced that we have this production 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.110
 just because everybody is working on this team 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.520
 these had believed this success 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.520
 challenge with it 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.430
 14 42 double ropes over the river above 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 the river is perpendicular to the traverse 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.480
 Then we hang on a point 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.069
 that we can pull out that all up 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.530
 the same point where then aim 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.319
 The surfers will make the way 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.150
 balls really brazen we are about to 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.489
 the first shock of the leftovers 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.180
 trigger if all cameras with each other 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.280
 trigger 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.280
 we will miss that right now 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.120
 we are done, everything went well 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.950
 as far as I can judge 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.720
 We also have all the pictures in the box of the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.720
 a totally successful day
