 Hi, what am I like about music? 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.740
 I promised in the previous video I bring you 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.519
 activities that I do day to day in my 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.459
 music class 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.110
 today I present a little super glass 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.600
 simple that he did with students of the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.750
 first of colarnos that have six years 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.370
 I will explain it very slowly and then 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.370
 I'll do a little faster to see the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.230
 or I'm going to do it with my left hand 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.330
 so that it serves as a mirror since 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 they 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
 they confuse with right to left 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 so now it's in the mirror for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.900
 with my left hand but is that you have 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.630
 to enter with the right question 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.970
 we would start the first four courses 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.950
 They are the following 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 to 123 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 and 4 that would be repeated twice would be like that 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 one gave 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.710
 and 412 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.989
 and 4 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.010
 that would be the first part the second 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.560
 part is very easy would be the hand 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.380
 left would also be put to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.380
 left fast I make myself 123 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.100
 12 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.690
 4 I repeat it again 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:36.530
 it would be like this 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:38.690
 1 I come back 34 1 rollover 34 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.690
 I do the second one a little faster 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:49.030
 it would be like this 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:56.520
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 repeat the entire game 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:02:02.890
 first part would be 123 placed a 2 3 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.570
 placed and I return it to 3 4 and I return it to 3 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.850
 4 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.510
 what he does fast so you can see the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.510
 sound aspect 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.409
 to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 again 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.969
 Well, I do not think I've liked anything 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.159
 this game so simple and you know that 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.230
 he has done it for the children of first 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.549
 that at first it cost a bit of 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 work for which they have done 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.560
 perfectly good you already know what to put 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.810
 that abyss on facebook twitter and rim with 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 the fingers if you liked the video
