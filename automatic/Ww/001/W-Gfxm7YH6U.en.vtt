00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
a very popular wheel they're introduced

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.580 
a very popular wheel they're introduced
in<00:00:10.670> 2012<00:00:11.670> 2013<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.570> since<00:00:13.139> then<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:13.469> be

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
in 2012 2013 and since then they be

for<00:00:48.090> odd<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.050> spokes<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.850> I'm

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
for odd the spokes on this one and I'm

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.279 
for odd the spokes on this one and I'm
just<00:00:51.090> opening<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> most<00:00:51.629> popular<00:00:51.989> color<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just opening the most popular color I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:09.290 
just opening the most popular color I
have<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> gun<00:00:53.670> blue

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.360 

there<00:01:10.300> it<00:01:10.390> is

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
there it is

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
there it is
so<00:01:12.370> this<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.760> a<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.210> Graham<00:01:13.390> lights<00:01:13.920> 57<00:01:14.920> dr

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so this is a the Graham lights 57 dr

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.540 
so this is a the Graham lights 57 dr
what<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:16.480> don't<00:01:16.630> know<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.020> 57<00:01:17.500> dr<00:01:17.770> it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
what we don't know is the 57 dr it's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.370 
what we don't know is the 57 dr it's
made<00:01:18.940> exclusively<00:01:19.180> for<00:01:19.450> North<00:01:19.750> America<00:01:20.170> and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
made exclusively for North America and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.950 
made exclusively for North America and
Japan<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.100> 57<00:01:21.729> D<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.180> it's<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
Japan is the 57 D and it's the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.160 
Japan is the 57 D and it's the
derivative<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.650> wheel<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.870> just

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
derivative of that wheel so it's just

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.040 
derivative of that wheel so it's just
like<00:01:26.290> this<00:01:26.490> 557<00:01:27.490> c6<00:01:27.910> it's<00:01:28.210> got<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.720> six<00:01:28.900> book

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
like this 557 c6 it's got the six book

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.830 
like this 557 c6 it's got the six book
design<00:01:29.410> very<00:01:30.220> concave<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> inside<00:01:31.570> here

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
design very concave on the inside here

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.830 
design very concave on the inside here
but<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.040> main<00:01:33.190> difference<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.850> lip<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.540> if

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
but the main difference is the lip so if

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.540 
but the main difference is the lip so if
you're<00:01:34.930> trying<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.170> decide<00:01:35.500> between<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.009> 57

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
you're trying to decide between the 57

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.870 
you're trying to decide between the 57
c6<00:01:37.030> or<00:01:37.270> 57<00:01:37.720> VR<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:39.160> main<00:01:39.280> difference<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.729> where

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
c6 or 57 VR the main difference is where

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.150 
c6 or 57 VR the main difference is where
the<00:01:40.000> spoke<00:01:40.270> meets<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.780> lip<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.530> seven<00:01:41.800> c6

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
the spoke meets the lip to be seven c6

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.680 
the spoke meets the lip to be seven c6
you'll<00:01:42.280> see<00:01:42.460> equals<00:01:42.700> flat<00:01:42.970> right<00:01:43.180> against<00:01:43.420> lip

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
you'll see equals flat right against lip

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.710 
you'll see equals flat right against lip
here<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> 57<00:01:45.369> dr<00:01:45.610> has<00:01:45.910> this<00:01:46.060> nice<00:01:46.300> lip<00:01:46.570> on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
here but a 57 dr has this nice lip on

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.980 
here but a 57 dr has this nice lip on
the<00:01:46.810> inside<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.820> wheels<00:01:49.119> very<00:01:49.330> popular<00:01:49.780> on

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
the inside this wheels very popular on

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.749 
the inside this wheels very popular on
the<00:01:50.020> FRS<00:01:50.410> BRZ<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.190> one<00:01:51.340> here<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.610> actually

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
the FRS BRZ this one here is actually

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.780 
the FRS BRZ this one here is actually
for<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.840> platform<00:01:53.050> so<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.830> 17<00:01:54.400> by<00:01:54.580> 9

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
for that platform so we have a 17 by 9

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.450 
for that platform so we have a 17 by 9

wheels<00:01:59.950> really<00:02:00.220> pop<00:02:00.399> out<00:02:00.550> if<00:02:00.940> vehicles<00:02:01.420> can

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
wheels really pop out if vehicles can

Gucci's<00:02:02.440> current<00:02:02.890> granny<00:02:03.850> saw<00:02:04.119> racing<00:02:04.540> car<00:02:04.810> is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
Gucci's current granny saw racing car is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.729 
Gucci's current granny saw racing car is
using<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.380> 57<00:02:05.860> DRS<00:02:06.190> for<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.120> chief<00:02:07.510> competition

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
using the 57 DRS for a chief competition

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.710 
using the 57 DRS for a chief competition
so<00:02:08.739> there's<00:02:09.160> really<00:02:09.340> like<00:02:09.580> wheel<00:02:09.760> very<00:02:10.209> strong

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so there's really like wheel very strong

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.920 
so there's really like wheel very strong
