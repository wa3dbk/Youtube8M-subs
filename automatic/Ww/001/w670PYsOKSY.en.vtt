00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.520 

we're<00:00:00.269> going<00:00:00.420> to<00:00:00.480> look<00:00:00.630> at<00:00:00.870> how<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> set<00:00:01.500> up

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
we're going to look at how to set up

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.860 
we're going to look at how to set up
clipless<00:00:02.100> pedals<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:02.909> shoes<00:00:05.629> first<00:00:06.629> let's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
clipless pedals and shoes first let's

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.960 
clipless pedals and shoes first let's
look<00:00:06.930> at<00:00:07.049> cleat<00:00:07.350> placement<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.099> shoe<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
look at cleat placement in the shoe the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.730 
look at cleat placement in the shoe the
cleat<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.570> little<00:00:09.990> metal<00:00:10.440> interface

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
cleat is this little metal interface

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.680 
cleat is this little metal interface
that<00:00:11.160> actually<00:00:11.460> clips<00:00:11.790> into<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> spring

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
that actually clips into the spring

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.589 
that actually clips into the spring
retention<00:00:13.230> system<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> pedal<00:00:14.599> placement

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
retention system on the pedal placement

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.460 
retention system on the pedal placement
on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> bottom<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> shoe<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> really

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
on the bottom the shoe is really

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
on the bottom the shoe is really
important<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.550> pedaling<00:00:18.060> efficiency

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
important for pedaling efficiency

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.810 
important for pedaling efficiency
it<00:00:19.140> also<00:00:19.289> affects<00:00:19.560> how<00:00:20.010> well<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.430> move<00:00:20.609> your

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it also affects how well you move your

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.120 
it also affects how well you move your
weight<00:00:20.970> around<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> bike<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.800> bottom

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
weight around on the bike in the bottom

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.099 
weight around on the bike in the bottom
of<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.279> shoe<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.539> these<00:00:24.630> slots

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
of your shoe you have two of these slots

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.200 
of your shoe you have two of these slots
so<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> move<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.310> cleat<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> down

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so you can move the cleat up and down

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
so you can move the cleat up and down
and<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> feel<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.500> where<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.980> want<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and get a feel for where you want to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.089 
and get a feel for where you want to
place<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.789> cleat<00:00:30.529> something<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lot

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
place that cleat something I see a lot

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.770 
place that cleat something I see a lot
of<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.520> coaching<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> lot<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.510> people<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
of with coaching is a lot of people have

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
of with coaching is a lot of people have
their<00:00:33.960> clique<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.559> far<00:00:34.800> forward<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
their clique really far forward in the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
their clique really far forward in the
shoe<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> rise

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
shoe and that will make you rise

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
shoe and that will make you rise
slightly<00:00:37.829> toe<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.450> always<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
slightly toe down it's not always the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
slightly toe down it's not always the
best<00:00:40.140> place<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.770> especially<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.280> you're

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
best place to be especially if you're

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
best place to be especially if you're
writing<00:00:41.579> technical<00:00:42.090> trails<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.290> actually

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
writing technical trails so actually

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.350 
writing technical trails so actually
sliding<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.100> cleat<00:00:44.399> further<00:00:44.760> back<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
sliding your cleat further back and the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
sliding your cleat further back and the
shoe<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:46.500> meet<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> stand<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.370> bit

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
shoe will meet you stand a little bit

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
shoe will meet you stand a little bit
flatter<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> pedal<00:00:48.809> rather<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.320> being

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
flatter on the pedal rather than being

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
flatter on the pedal rather than being
up<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.219> toes<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.870> there's<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
up and on your toes like that there's a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720 
up and on your toes like that there's a
slight<00:00:52.079> argument<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.250> stand<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
slight argument that if you stand a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369 
slight argument that if you stand a
little<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.210> toes<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.870> you'll<00:00:55.110> use

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
little bit more toes down you'll use

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
little bit more toes down you'll use
your<00:00:55.710> calves<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.640> pedaling<00:00:57.059> there's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
your calves more for pedaling there's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
your calves more for pedaling there's
nothing<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.500> proves<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
nothing that really proves that that is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
nothing that really proves that that is
a<00:00:59.460> more<00:00:59.699> powerful<00:00:59.940> pedal<00:01:00.480> stroke<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
a more powerful pedal stroke so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
a more powerful pedal stroke so
something<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.070> definitely<00:01:02.460> noticed<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> if

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
something I definitely noticed that if

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
something I definitely noticed that if
you<00:01:03.329> bring<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.960> cleat<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.559> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you bring that cleat a little bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
you bring that cleat a little bit
further<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.880> will<00:01:06.060> flatten<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.780> foot

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
further back it will flatten your foot

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
further back it will flatten your foot
tight<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.100> help<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> riding

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tight and that can really help it riding

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
tight and that can really help it riding
technical<00:01:09.270> terrain<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.229> ball<00:01:10.439> park<00:01:10.740> place

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
technical terrain the ball park place

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
technical terrain the ball park place
start<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.729> cleat<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
start with your cleat is back on the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.469 
start with your cleat is back on the
ball<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.380> foot<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.939> run<00:01:15.270> my

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
ball of your foot I actually run my

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
ball of your foot I actually run my
cleats<00:01:15.810> far<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> shoe<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> it'll<00:01:17.369> go

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
cleats far back and the shoe is it'll go

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
cleats far back and the shoe is it'll go
and<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.180> slides<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.780> foot<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.320> bit

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and that slides my foot a little bit

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
and that slides my foot a little bit
further<00:01:19.770> forward<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> pedals<00:01:20.729> makes<00:01:21.540> me

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
further forward on the pedals makes me

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
further forward on the pedals makes me
slightly<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.200> heels<00:01:22.470> die<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.220> really

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
slightly more heels die and that really

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
slightly more heels die and that really
suits<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.119> style<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.570> riding<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.170> something

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
suits my style is riding but something

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.020 
suits my style is riding but something
that's<00:01:25.710> well<00:01:26.009> worth<00:01:26.189> playing<00:01:26.490> around<00:01:26.790> with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that's well worth playing around with

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.080 
that's well worth playing around with
that<00:01:27.509> front<00:01:27.869> bat<00:01:28.229> movement<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> shoe<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that front bat movement on the shoe with

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
that front bat movement on the shoe with
your<00:01:30.119> cleat<00:01:30.540> you'll<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.140> two<00:01:31.380> bolts<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> make

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
your cleat you'll get two bolts to make

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
your cleat you'll get two bolts to make
that<00:01:32.369> cleat<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> bottom<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> shoe<00:01:33.479> but

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that cleat to the bottom of the shoe but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
that cleat to the bottom of the shoe but
also<00:01:34.170> you'll<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.740> little<00:01:34.950> plastic

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
cleat a little bit further away from the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
cleat a little bit further away from the
shoe<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.250> might<00:01:59.579> helps<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> don't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
alternatively you could just take a bit

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440 
alternatively you could just take a bit
of<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> Stanley<00:02:05.070> blade<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.759> rubber<00:02:06.090> and

of a Stanley blade to that rubber and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.969 
of a Stanley blade to that rubber and
get<00:02:06.810> rid<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.020> some<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.320> rubber<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.799> can

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
get rid of some that rubber so you can

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.730 
get rid of some that rubber so you can
get<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.459> out

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
four to aft position next we'll look at

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.230 
four to aft position next we'll look at
this<00:02:37.780> side<00:02:38.050> side<00:02:38.440> placement<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.820> might<00:02:40.000> find

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
this side side placement you might find

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.210 
this side side placement you might find
that<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.780> your<00:02:41.230> cleat<00:02:41.560> too<00:02:41.800> far<00:02:42.070> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that if you have your cleat too far to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.370 
that if you have your cleat too far to
the<00:02:42.280> outside<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.730> your<00:02:42.880> shoe<00:02:43.300> that's<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.260> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
the outside of your shoe that's going to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.470 
the outside of your shoe that's going to
put<00:02:44.590> your<00:02:44.710> foot<00:02:45.040> really<00:02:45.460> close<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
put your foot really close up to the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320 
put your foot really close up to the
cranks<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.530> especially<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:48.100> your<00:02:48.250> back<00:02:48.910> foot

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
cranks so especially on your back foot

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.300 
cranks so especially on your back foot
you<00:02:49.690> might<00:02:49.840> find<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.320> when<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> try<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you might find that when you try and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
you might find that when you try and
clip<00:02:51.610> out<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.120> actually<00:02:52.240> push<00:02:52.630> your<00:02:52.660> toe<00:02:53.050> into

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
clip out you actually push your toe into

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.230 
clip out you actually push your toe into
the<00:02:53.710> crank<00:02:54.010> before<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.700> get<00:02:54.820> out<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.000> your

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
the crank before you can get out of your

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.930 
the crank before you can get out of your
pedal<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.650> case<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.220> would<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:57.520> slide

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
pedal so in that case I would then slide

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.670 
pedal so in that case I would then slide
this<00:02:58.180> cleat<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.750> inside<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.410> foot

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
this cleat to the inside of the foot

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.710 
this cleat to the inside of the foot
that's<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.730> bring<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> pedal<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.540> bit

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
that's going to bring the pedal a bit

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.660 
that's going to bring the pedal a bit
further<00:03:02.110> away<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> crank<00:03:03.160> further<00:03:03.460> away

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
further away and the crank further away

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.880 
further away and the crank further away
and<00:03:03.820> give<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.270> more<00:03:04.300> space<00:03:04.710> but<00:03:05.710> you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and give you a bit more space but you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.590 
and give you a bit more space but you
might<00:03:06.070> also<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.490> play<00:03:06.670> around<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.180> so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
might also have to play around that so

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720 
might also have to play around that so
that<00:03:07.750> your<00:03:07.870> rubber<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.680> shoe<00:03:08.890> doesn't<00:03:09.310> touch

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
that your rubber the shoe doesn't touch

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.580 
that your rubber the shoe doesn't touch
the<00:03:10.000> pedal<00:03:10.480> before<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.870> clip<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.320> I'll<00:03:11.410> clip

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the pedal before you clip and I'll clip

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.340 
the pedal before you clip and I'll clip
out<00:03:12.060> alternatively<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.630> can<00:03:13.690> actually<00:03:14.020> fit

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
out alternatively you can actually fit

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.590 
out alternatively you can actually fit
space<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> pedal<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.790> bring<00:03:16.420> that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
space it to the pedal to bring that

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.000 
space it to the pedal to bring that
pedal<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.110> little<00:03:17.140> bit<00:03:17.530> further<00:03:17.830> away<00:03:17.980> from

pedal a little bit further away from
that<00:03:18.280> crank<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.390> now<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.660> set<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.080> angle<00:03:20.710> of

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
that crank so now to set the angle of

that crank so now to set the angle of
this<00:03:21.040> cleat<00:03:21.430> in<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> shoe<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.720> really<00:03:22.990> want

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
this cleat in the shoe you really want

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.200 
this cleat in the shoe you really want
Matt<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.410> match<00:03:23.800> your<00:03:24.040> natural<00:03:24.340> stance<00:03:24.880> on<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
pedals so noisy square in line with the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.610 
pedals so noisy square in line with the
length<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.450> shoes<00:03:28.720> play<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.110> best<00:03:29.320> place<00:03:29.590> to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
length the shoes play the best place to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.280 
length the shoes play the best place to
start<00:03:29.950> try<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.510> how<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.810> feels

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
start try that out see how that feels

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.960 
start try that out see how that feels
you<00:03:32.710> can<00:03:32.830> also<00:03:33.010> play<00:03:33.340> around<00:03:33.370> with<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.910> a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
you can also play around with that a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.810 
you can also play around with that a
little<00:03:34.300> bit<00:03:34.450> angling<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.590> cleat<00:03:36.100> slightly

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
little bit angling that cleat slightly

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780 
little bit angling that cleat slightly
so<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.540> it's<00:03:37.780> already<00:03:38.050> closer<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> point

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so that it's already closer to the point

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.390 
so that it's already closer to the point
of<00:03:39.970> release<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.780> pedal<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.380> throw<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.280> in

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
of release of the pedal so throw it in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.770 
of release of the pedal so throw it in
sight<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.820> even<00:03:43.300> when<00:03:43.420> you're<00:03:43.540> stood

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
sight like that even when you're stood

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.020 
sight like that even when you're stood
normally<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.920> really<00:03:45.250> close<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.550> popping

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
normally it's really close to popping

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.510 
normally it's really close to popping
out<00:03:46.230> depends<00:03:47.230> how<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.950> some<00:03:48.490> people

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
out depends how you like it some people

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.310 
out depends how you like it some people
don't<00:03:48.970> like<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.360> because<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.870> might<00:03:50.020> come

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
don't like that because you might come

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.450 
don't like that because you might come
out<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.770> pedal<00:03:51.010> when<00:03:51.250> you're<00:03:51.370> not

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
out of the pedal when you're not

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.820 
out of the pedal when you're not
expected<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:51.990> once<00:03:52.990> you<00:03:53.200> find<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.560> nice

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
placement of this cleat make sure you

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.780 
placement of this cleat make sure you
tighten<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.140> down<00:03:56.170> nice<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.650> tight<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.370> don't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
tighten it down nice and tight you don't

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.370 
tighten it down nice and tight you don't
want<00:03:58.030> these<00:03:58.180> coming<00:03:58.540> loose<00:03:58.690> or<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.930> bolt<00:03:59.170> fall

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
want these coming loose or a bolt fall

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.100 
want these coming loose or a bolt fall
and<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.650> have<00:04:00.040> seen<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.400> happened<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.870> then

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
and I have seen that happened what then

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.570 
and I have seen that happened what then
can<00:04:02.350> happen<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:03.010> cleat<00:04:03.280> will<00:04:03.400> start

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
can happen is that cleat will start

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.920 
can happen is that cleat will start
spinning<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> shoe<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.630> you'll<00:04:04.810> get

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
spinning in the shoe and you'll get

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.540 
spinning in the shoe and you'll get
stuck<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.590> pedal<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.160> then<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> have

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
stuck to that pedal and then you have

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.160 
stuck to that pedal and then you have
one<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.790> those<00:04:06.880> embarrassing<00:04:07.030> tip<00:04:07.720> overs<00:04:08.020> we

crosscountry<00:04:22.470> pedal<00:04:22.920> as<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.280> see<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.580> much

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
crosscountry pedal as you see it's much

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.840 
crosscountry pedal as you see it's much
smaller<00:04:24.210> much<00:04:24.570> lighter<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:26.250> let's<00:04:26.490> start<00:04:26.730> with

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
smaller much lighter so let's start with

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.370 
smaller much lighter so let's start with
the<00:04:26.910> downhill<00:04:27.270> pedals<00:04:27.630> obviously<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.140> big

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the downhill pedals obviously this big

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.960 
the downhill pedals obviously this big
cage<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.280> give<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.520> some<00:04:29.760> support

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
cage is going to give you some support

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.270 
cage is going to give you some support
so<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:30.990> actually<00:04:31.110> feel<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.620> paddle<00:04:32.220> on

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
so you can actually feel that paddle on

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.130 
so you can actually feel that paddle on
the<00:04:32.340> bottom<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.760> your<00:04:32.850> shoe<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.900> get<00:04:34.110> a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
the bottom of your shoe so you get a

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.080 
the bottom of your shoe so you get a
little<00:04:34.500> bit<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.680> friction<00:04:34.920> you've<00:04:35.520> also<00:04:35.700> got

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
little bit of friction you've also got

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.900 
little bit of friction you've also got
these<00:04:36.240> little<00:04:36.680> adjustable<00:04:37.680> grub<00:04:38.010> screws<00:04:38.400> you

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
these little adjustable grub screws you

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.100 
these little adjustable grub screws you
can<00:04:38.970> play<00:04:39.300> around<00:04:39.420> with<00:04:39.660> those<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.080> can

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
can play around with those so you can

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.750 
can play around with those so you can
feel<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.470> little<00:04:40.890> bit<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.340> paddle<00:04:41.670> on<00:04:41.730> the

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
feel a little bit of the paddle on the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.610 
feel a little bit of the paddle on the
bottom<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.180> shoe<00:04:42.390> obviously<00:04:43.320> if<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.470> bring

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
bottom the shoe obviously if you bring

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.290 
bottom the shoe obviously if you bring
them<00:04:43.800> out<00:04:43.950> too<00:04:44.160> much<00:04:44.400> you'll<00:04:44.640> get<00:04:44.760> too<00:04:45.090> much

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
them out too much you'll get too much

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.720 
them out too much you'll get too much
friction<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:46.560> gonna<00:04:46.830> make<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.520> much

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
friction and that's gonna make it much

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.250 
friction and that's gonna make it much
harder<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.150> get<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.420> and<00:04:48.540> out<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.870> paddle

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
harder to get in and out of that paddle

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740 
harder to get in and out of that paddle
I<00:04:49.430> really<00:04:50.430> like<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.790> style<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.210> paddle<00:04:51.600> and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
I really like this style of paddle and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.020 
I really like this style of paddle and
it's<00:04:52.050> also<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.920> seems<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.280> work<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.640> nicely

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
it's also it seems to work really nicely

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.900 
it's also it seems to work really nicely
with<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.420> slightly<00:04:54.720> softer<00:04:55.530> sole<00:04:55.950> shoe<00:04:56.280> it

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
with a slightly softer sole shoe it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.670 
with a slightly softer sole shoe it
feels<00:04:57.090> almost<00:04:57.300> like<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.690> flat<00:04:58.020> pedal<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.560> can

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
feels almost like a flat pedal you can

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.170 
feels almost like a flat pedal you can
actually<00:04:58.830> feel<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.280> paddle<00:04:59.790> in<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.910> bottom

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
actually feel that paddle in the bottom

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.680 
actually feel that paddle in the bottom
of<00:05:00.240> your<00:05:00.300> shoe<00:05:01.550> what<00:05:02.550> you'll<00:05:02.670> find<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:03.330> these

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
of your shoe what you'll find is these

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.480 
of your shoe what you'll find is these
smaller<00:05:04.140> cross<00:05:04.530> country<00:05:04.740> pedals<00:05:05.250> they're

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
smaller cross country pedals they're

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.130 
smaller cross country pedals they're
suited<00:05:05.880> much<00:05:06.090> better<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.750> these<00:05:06.900> cross

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
suited much better to these cross

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.780 
suited much better to these cross
country<00:05:07.350> shoes<00:05:07.800> they'll<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:08.670> a<00:05:08.700> much

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
country shoes they'll have a much

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.700 
country shoes they'll have a much
stiffer<00:05:09.240> sole<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:09.900> don't<00:05:10.140> really<00:05:10.350> need

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
stiffer sole so you don't really need

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.190 
stiffer sole so you don't really need
that<00:05:11.040> extra<00:05:11.400> support<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.660> big<00:05:12.870> platform

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
that extra support of a big platform

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.860 
that extra support of a big platform
pedal<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.670> got<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.060> sole<00:05:15.390> support<00:05:15.780> in

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
pedal you just got that sole support in

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.870 
pedal you just got that sole support in
your<00:05:15.990> foot<00:05:16.260> as<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:17.070> see<00:05:17.310> with<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.580> big

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
your foot as you see with this big

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.570 
your foot as you see with this big
downhill<00:05:18.480> style<00:05:18.750> pedal<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.740> shoe<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:20.160> really

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
downhill style pedal the shoe is really

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.670 
downhill style pedal the shoe is really
touching<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.030> pedal<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:21.630> there's<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.380> lot<00:05:22.590> of

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
touching the pedal so there's a lot of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.500 
touching the pedal so there's a lot of
feel<00:05:23.010> there<00:05:23.340> in<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.610> bottom<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:24.000> your<00:05:24.030> foot

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
feel there in the bottom of your foot

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.200 
feel there in the bottom of your foot
also<00:05:25.170> really<00:05:25.740> good<00:05:25.920> for<00:05:25.980> maybe<00:05:26.580> for<00:05:26.910> not

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
also really good for maybe for not

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.540 
also really good for maybe for not
clipped<00:05:27.540> in<00:05:27.780> on<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> technical<00:05:28.500> section<00:05:29.010> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
clipped in on a technical section you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.360 
clipped in on a technical section you
still<00:05:29.790> got<00:05:29.910> a<00:05:29.940> big<00:05:30.180> platform<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.840> stand<00:05:31.020> on

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
still got a big platform to stand on

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.590 
still got a big platform to stand on
compare<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.790> cross<00:05:33.000> country<00:05:33.210> style

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
compare that to the cross country style

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.550 
compare that to the cross country style
shoe<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.650> pedal<00:05:35.100> obviously<00:05:36.000> much<00:05:36.300> less

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
shoe and pedal obviously much less

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.080 
shoe and pedal obviously much less
platform<00:05:37.560> there<00:05:37.890> so<00:05:38.580> you're<00:05:38.670> not<00:05:38.820> going<00:05:39.000> to

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
platform there so you're not going to

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.880 
platform there so you're not going to
get<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.510> same<00:05:39.870> feel<00:05:40.290> in<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.560> bottom<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.860> your

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
get that same feel in the bottom of your

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.790 
get that same feel in the bottom of your
foot<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:42.840> doesn't<00:05:43.170> matter<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.470> much<00:05:43.500> when

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
foot and it doesn't matter so much when

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.320 
foot and it doesn't matter so much when
you're<00:05:43.890> clipped<00:05:44.160> in<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:44.760> if<00:05:44.940> for<00:05:45.120> any<00:05:45.210> reason

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
you're clipped in but if for any reason

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.240 
you're clipped in but if for any reason
you<00:05:45.750> ride<00:05:45.900> clip<00:05:46.200> tight<00:05:46.440> it's<00:05:46.830> not<00:05:47.070> going<00:05:47.190> to

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
you ride clip tight it's not going to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.700 
you ride clip tight it's not going to
help<00:05:47.400> quite<00:05:47.670> so<00:05:47.790> much<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.170> a<00:05:49.200> style<00:05:49.530> of
