00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.499
 I am working with android and today I am going to 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.940
 teach how to move the apps to the sd without 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.160
 root and with root 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 Well, I'll start with the users, not 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.090
 light that are the majority we would go to the play 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.980
 good we can do it in two ways a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.050
 manual that would be in settings 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.420
 application manager and you 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.789
 we would look for our application 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.010
 we would give it to her and we would give 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.390
 move good this is in the headquarters but you 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.399
 we would move the headquarters here 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.589
 another option would be to go to the Google play and 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.469
 download this program that good this 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:42.440
 this application that will be called app 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.179
 sd we would give it to open we would escape to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.339
 the list of applications that we will have and 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.229
 those in the internal memory and the 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.479
 external memory right now good me 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.550
 I have six of the memories and internal 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.929
 how would we spend as we would spend 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.179
 sorry we would give him to move all the 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.800
 applications and here we would make selection 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.899
 if the bad thing is that we would have to go 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.789
 for one as you have seen before 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.560
 we would move here and go back 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.170
 move here 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
 now we give you with the project move 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.050
 here etc 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 well so far the video for the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.380
 non-root users root users the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 only difference is that we could 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 pass them all at once 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.390
 and now I will show you how we would go to the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.500
 google play download a file that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.080
 will always be in the description of 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.430
 video to be called link to sd now os 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 I write it link to is and it's perfect 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.020
 would this program we would open and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 I already have it installed there as you can see 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.160
 to leave the moments there even in the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.740
 I attended it to installed we would give 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.630
 open and here in the filter that you have 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.590
 seen up there that has as a 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.660
 way we would give it to in memory 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.400
 internal and now we would give here to 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.600
 select several select and masters 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.240
 those that we would like to pass for example 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.220
 will select this as an example you 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 well we would mark all and we would give 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.210
 move to the perfect sd card well so 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.830
 it would happen to us all at once it would take a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.460
 little but we would spend all 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 directly 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.910
