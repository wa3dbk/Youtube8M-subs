00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.939
 what was reported should be a complete game of the captor to the flag in xbox 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:22.519
 live 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.279
 where I think I had a very good participation as I defended attack 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.910
 what we have to do ours where the law is double meaning 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.730
 fifteen 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 of all this game 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 and we did everything right minus four 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 except for this silly move that I'll try at the beginning 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.050
 because never 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.330
 although he tried to be the center by camouflage but 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 on that occasion I wanted to try something different and it does not come out 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.450
 total that I appear 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.190
 i according to stern directito was not based on the flag 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 that's why we do not urge to attack 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.560
 and it's good that I did it because there was nobody covering our flag 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 so I feel a triple 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 everything comes another another tip others want to be loved 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.970
 between my partner I killed him 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 that's what I consider a 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 one of the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.330
 I do not know in the most common sectors with its power to capture the flag 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 the people who want to go for the flag 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 always rushes 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.370
 never accompany with another partner to discover 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 hoon do not kill those who are running the flag first 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.380
 and then when they are books, she leaves running with the band 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.180
 what it is that on this occasion of those rare occasions 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.670
 I had a very good team that knew 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.730
 what are we playing, not even what we're going to do 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.170
 that play that he loved then because it is currently if the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.179
 plant 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:13.579
 so too 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.229
 pearl at pleasure 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.349
 and do not you that china 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.950
 my partner who is up there 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.950
 will let these enemies pass for a moment 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.859
 without killing him despite the fact that shotgun ing 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.669
 the guy already thought he was going to go but 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.929
 as 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.659
 I am an expert reading in 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.209
 the sensor 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 behind him 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.659
 there is another 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 juntitos red that looks closely our flag 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.509
 he goes after her she did not even try to kill 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.259
 the until cover 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.099
 paco mate people in this game 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.319
 in fact I think he 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.899
 if I'm not mistaken it's to death at the beginning with the the only time that the 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.769
 die 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.249
 Reasonable 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.749
 since he assured that 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.489
 only muniesa 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.239
 here of the comfer and another the standard-bearer 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.099
 I'm going to run your exit 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.099
 in two 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.089
 what was previously toasted 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:29.449
 and with the partner and far better discuss it to leave 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.620
 little more but here with another partner for him 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.349
 represented the flag 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.069
 there is repression 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.479
 or here and I was wrong 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
 vilely 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.439
 replacement villa 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.879
 now the relevant little one was 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.879
 I do not hide with the flag and he is watching on television because 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.139
 won bottle defray 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
 Buenos Aires law despairs of abortion 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.179
 that red dot that you see 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:04.669
 on the left 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.029
 I thought he was going to attack me, that's why 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.059
 southern 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.409
 regenerator but 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.700
 because we did not cover 2 0 'proffered by writing down the third flag that 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.699
 defend it us 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.840
 here he cited the flag and I get 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.050
 help my team 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.150
 so they do not kill us all and it's good that what they did for experts goes 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 to see the result 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:41.460
 Topped the second 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.229
 marked the third 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.050
 fourth deck 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.050
 in those two Xs of my colleagues who died there 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.879
 sometimes it's better to drop the flag and pretend to be late 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.919
 of killing the enemies and then passing the flag 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.039
 charlotte nc- or four minutes 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.039
 up an instrument 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:10.300
 I hope you liked this episode, hundred shows you how it is that 

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.439
 If you are cold-blooded and if you are a little more patient you can not 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.939
 do interesting things things 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.569
 trying to win a gold 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.300
 a game where you are required to 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.530
 that you know how to play and that you know how to work in a team
