00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
like I said I don't know if it was just

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.660 
like I said I don't know if it was just
my<00:05:23.900> computer<00:05:24.440> or<00:05:24.590> if<00:05:24.650> it's<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.920> actual<00:05:25.070> music

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
video but a lot of the parts like

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.980 
video but a lot of the parts like
especially<00:05:28.550> in<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.730> beginning<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.660> lips

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
especially in the beginning the lips

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.620 
especially in the beginning the lips
aren't<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:31.280> like<00:05:31.490> it's<00:05:31.700> like<00:05:31.880> it's<00:05:32.330> like<00:05:32.419> the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
aren't it's like it's like it's like the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.659 
aren't it's like it's like it's like the
stink<00:05:32.900> was<00:05:33.020> off<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.380> little<00:05:33.710> from<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.070> sound<00:05:34.310> it

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
stink was off a little from the sound it

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.909 
stink was off a little from the sound it
was<00:05:34.880> like<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.660> lips<00:05:35.870> would<00:05:36.020> move<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.560> then<00:05:36.890> it

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
was like the lips would move and then it

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.400 
was like the lips would move and then it
was<00:05:37.100> like<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.340> sound<00:05:37.640> like<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:39.169> was<00:05:39.260> like

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
was like the sound like it was like

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.200 
was like the sound like it was like
probably<00:05:39.560> like<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.860> split<00:05:40.400> second<00:05:40.820> all<00:05:40.970> fix

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
probably like a split second all fix

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.140 
probably like a split second all fix
just<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.930> split<00:05:42.560> second<00:05:42.980> off<00:05:43.130> but<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.430> could<00:05:43.669> tell

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
just a split second off but I could tell

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.820 
just a split second off but I could tell
oh<00:05:46.270> if<00:05:47.270> so<00:05:47.870> I<00:05:47.900> hope<00:05:48.230> that<00:05:48.260> was<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.740> my

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
oh if so I hope that was just my

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.990 
oh if so I hope that was just my
computer<00:05:49.010> because<00:05:49.460> if<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:49.640> was<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.880> actual

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
computer because if that was the actual

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.850 
computer because if that was the actual
music<00:05:50.480> video<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:51.020> is<00:05:51.320> really<00:05:52.160> bad<00:05:52.790> cuz<00:05:53.860> it's

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
music video that is really bad cuz it's

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.530 
music video that is really bad cuz it's
an<00:05:54.980> actual<00:05:55.220> official<00:05:55.610> music<00:05:55.760> video<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.300> think

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
an actual official music video I think

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.180 
an actual official music video I think
people<00:05:56.960> should<00:05:56.990> double-check<00:05:57.410> that<00:05:57.860> if<00:05:58.040> it's

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
people should double-check that if it's

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.510 
people should double-check that if it's
the<00:05:58.760> video<00:05:59.030> but<00:05:59.660> anyways<00:05:59.990> other<00:06:00.830> than<00:06:01.310> that

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
the video but anyways other than that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.960 
the video but anyways other than that

I wasn't really paying like I was paying

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.940 
I wasn't really paying like I was paying
attention<00:06:19.700> in<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.880> beginning<00:06:20.210> but<00:06:20.620> like<00:06:21.620> I'm

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
attention in the beginning but like I'm

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.880 
attention in the beginning but like I'm
not<00:06:22.760> entirely<00:06:23.210> sure<00:06:23.419> when<00:06:23.930> I<00:06:23.960> realized<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:24.800> was

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
not entirely sure when I realized it was
