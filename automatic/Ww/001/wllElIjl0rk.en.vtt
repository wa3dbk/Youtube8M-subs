00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
sensors again also over here there's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.530 
sensors again also over here there's
actually<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> rear-view<00:03:29.580> camera<00:03:29.640> now<00:03:30.360> when<00:03:30.480> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
actually a rear-view camera now when the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 
actually a rear-view camera now when the
car<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:30.870> Reverse<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.380> can<00:03:31.530> actually<00:03:31.680> see

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
car is in Reverse you can actually see

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.690 
car is in Reverse you can actually see
behind<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:37.130> look<00:03:38.130> at<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.280> size<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.580> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
behind you look at the size of that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.059 
behind you look at the size of that
trunk<00:03:39.080> what's<00:03:40.080> nice<00:03:40.230> about<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.620> trunk<00:03:40.860> is

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
trunk what's nice about the trunk is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.940 
trunk what's nice about the trunk is
that<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:41.880> most<00:03:42.180> luxury<00:03:42.750> cars<00:03:43.049> they<00:03:43.590> don't<00:03:43.799> have

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
that on most luxury cars they don't have

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.680 
that on most luxury cars they don't have
a<00:03:44.010> pass-through<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.970> goes<00:03:45.120> through<00:03:45.360> Center

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
a pass-through that goes through Center

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.470 
a pass-through that goes through Center
