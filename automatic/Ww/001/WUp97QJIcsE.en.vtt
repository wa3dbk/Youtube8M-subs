00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.469
 Hello friends 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.700
 Today I want you one more 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.860
 introduce knives from my collection 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.240
 how to pack here is the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.810
 nice other contemporary but will 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 made today if both co co 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:34.700
 is the spider police 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.100
 internal manufacturer's photo 7 pe by spider 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:43.040
 The knife became co in 2003 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.780
 made and in this version of my 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.890
 opinion even today still produced 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890
 dwindle to the facts 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:10.360
 it is in picture stone knife so the sharks 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:21.650
 are made of stainless steel 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:26.510
 of the political medlock knife it has 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.560
 the standard clip so it is only in 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.310
 this version for right-handed tip 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:41.920
 portable down 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:47.320
 schwinn to the dimensions of the sweater the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:52.310
 Total length is 24 centimeters 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 the total sound length is 10.4 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.250
 centimeters and the cutting edge is 97 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:07.130
 centimeter 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:10.000
 the sound strength police are three 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 millimeter 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:20.859
 and you can see that by the blade 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.349
 she is still pretty much excluded 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:29.579
 and up here she has a wrong one 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:37.989
 cutting the blade has one 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:41.799
 Short circuit and the weight of this bike 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.159
 comes as is but there are 60 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.159
 gram 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.819
 yes, what's left for the knife? 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:03:01.329
 say it is an optimal four for me 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:03.840
 finger knife it is despite his like 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.579
 I have to say so pretty narrow 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.419
 So I worked quite a lot 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.579
 held 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:19.989
 but, as I said, it feels good in 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:25.349
 the hand and the blade length with 10 14 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:29.079
 I think that's pretty neat 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.879
 that's it, that's what it really is 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:39.310
 Game is still made today 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:42.879
 yes the steel stole is authority vgz 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:55.139
 This measurement was made of steel 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:57.549
 in the city and it is a nice part 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.939
 the masterful part of my beautiful 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.939
 collection 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:13.509
 As I said that was the idea of the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.630
 this is interplay patch so smooth 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:22.630
 contrary solutions what a knife 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.190
 little bit I think I collect 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.710
 I just have to be the object 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.870
 were cut with the ks has one 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.450
 kind filigree tip and thinks that the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.740
 maybe suffer from outbreaks 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:42.870
 Could it have been mine? 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.610
 home stood for the audience 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.610
 it greets third rangers
