and you have to take off the back like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.910 
and you have to take off the back like
this<00:01:13.299> then<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.390> find<00:01:14.689> former<00:01:15.289> cross<00:01:15.590> cycle

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
this then you find former cross cycle

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.289 
this then you find former cross cycle
with<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.340> passion<00:01:16.840> takes<00:01:17.840> bashing<00:01:18.229> off<00:01:18.409> and

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
slide form a cross out into the motor

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.700 
slide form a cross out into the motor
then<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:24.500> take<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.490> eight<00:01:26.350> small<00:01:27.350> key<00:01:27.560> wheel
