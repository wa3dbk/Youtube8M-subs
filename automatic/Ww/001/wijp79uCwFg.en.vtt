00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
let's quickly jump into quadrant

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.589 
let's quickly jump into quadrant
standard<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.910> we're<00:00:22.029> going<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.180> take<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.360> look

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
standard and we're going to take a look

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.420 
standard and we're going to take a look
at<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.990> system<00:00:23.230> information<00:00:23.619> on<00:00:24.040> this<00:00:24.189> device

real<00:00:24.700> quick<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.430> as<00:00:27.490> you<00:00:27.609> can<00:00:27.730> see<00:00:28.060> we<00:00:28.300> have<00:00:28.330> the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
real quick so as you can see we have the

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.480 
real quick so as you can see we have the
product<00:00:28.779> photo<00:00:29.050> here<00:00:29.350> it<00:00:29.650> says<00:00:29.800> m7<00:00:30.340> right

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
product photo here it says m7 right

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.130 
product photo here it says m7 right
there<00:00:30.760> if<00:00:31.090> you<00:00:31.210> come<00:00:31.390> down<00:00:31.539> we<00:00:31.689> can<00:00:31.810> see<00:00:31.869> that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
there if you come down we can see that

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.080 
there if you come down we can see that
we<00:00:32.290> have<00:00:32.320> an<00:00:32.470> arm<00:00:32.619> v7<00:00:32.769> processor<00:00:33.309> with<00:00:33.489> 1.7

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
we have an arm v7 processor with 1.7

we have an arm v7 processor with 1.7
gigahertz<00:00:34.330> for<00:00:35.140> cause<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.820> you<00:00:36.879> look<00:00:36.940> at

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
gigahertz for cause and if you look at

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.180 
gigahertz for cause and if you look at
the<00:00:37.120> membrane<00:00:37.390> it's<00:00:37.570> 1.6<00:00:38.019> gigabyte<00:00:38.650> versus

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
the membrane it's 1.6 gigabyte versus

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.470 
the membrane it's 1.6 gigabyte versus
the<00:00:39.340> two<00:00:39.489> gigabyte<00:00:39.850> mentioned<00:00:40.330> by<00:00:40.420> the

information let's quickly jump back into
the<00:01:11.430> benchmark<00:01:12.430> over<00:01:12.580> here<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.030> run<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.450> full

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
the benchmark over here and run a full

the benchmark over here and run a full
benchmark<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.440> guys

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.080 

this<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> results<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
this time for the results in as you can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.679 
this time for the results in as you can
see<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:28.350> impressive<00:01:28.979> 11,000<00:01:29.939> 972

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
see we have an impressive 11,000 972

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
see we have an impressive 11,000 972
that's<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.649> than<00:01:31.830> any<00:01:32.039> device<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that's more than any device on the

that's more than any device on the
quadrant<00:01:33.270> standard<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.000> can

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
quadrant standard as of now and you can

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
quadrant standard as of now and you can
see<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.659> 1x<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.320> somewhere<00:01:37.619> down<00:01:37.860> there

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
see that the 1x is somewhere down there

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.330 
see that the 1x is somewhere down there
in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> 3000<00:01:38.850> mark<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.960> HTC<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:41.039> the

m7 scores an impressive 11 972 I'm going

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
m7 scores an impressive 11 972 I'm going
to<00:01:45.090> quickly<00:01:45.210> jump<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.220> the

the performance of the graphics is on
the<00:01:54.539> HTC<00:01:55.049> One<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.380> let's<00:01:55.560> quickly<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> full

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
the HTC One so let's quickly do a full

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.809 
the HTC One so let's quickly do a full
test<00:02:01.880> as<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> guys<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.330> see<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.630> scores<00:02:03.929> a<00:02:04.080> 61

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819

impressive we're not too sure if it can
go<00:02:10.019> beyond<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:10.860> i<00:02:11.430> feel<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> Nina

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
go beyond that because i feel that Nina

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.800 
go beyond that because i feel that Nina
mark<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.870> only<00:02:13.080> rank<00:02:13.739> up<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> about<00:02:14.340> 60<00:02:14.760> 61<00:02:15.120> FPS

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
mark can only rank up to about 60 61 FPS

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.920 
mark can only rank up to about 60 61 FPS
so<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:17.130> too<00:02:17.250> sure<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.819> further<00:02:18.030> but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so not too sure if it can go further but

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.449 
so not too sure if it can go further but
let's<00:02:19.140> quickly<00:02:19.349> run<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.860> antutu<00:02:20.280> benchmark
