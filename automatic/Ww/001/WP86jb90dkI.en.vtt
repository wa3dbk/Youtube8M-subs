 you knew that tomography is a technique of exploring the sea are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 examples that he cited as a team called program that is based on the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.109
 reconstruction of structures of the organism 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.239
 of a patient can be observed 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.279
 in a computer coupled to a tomograph 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 what is happening inside your effort giving way

 so be it expressed 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.979
 the tomograph so in barreiros occupation of a natural area and k if you 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.520
 always needs such a form that external costs can be contained in the 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.270
 anatomical structure taxes 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.620
 it's like the vertigo belt 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.570
 da silva in the same way without having to physically cut a 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.830
 anatomical structure the tomograph Thursday slices like organ so that 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.970
 you can see how permanent what is generated 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
 we can observe a porter as with other institutions 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.860
 in the field of brain diseases neurology has been seen 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 reduced thanks to photography to reinforce the effectiveness of the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.070

 several surveys 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.470
 ozores during the tomographic study 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.510
 I just have to show the excellence of the wines as well 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.980
 it will be then 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.200
 after management of the medical emergency system sem 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 its main function the Senegalese 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.170
 these sanctions after seeing their figures in the united states 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.320
 clinical laboratories as we are human one year ago 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.470
 which has equipment 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.050
 the students 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.430

 even if they are not officials 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.650
 such as laboratory studies 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.380
 x-ray plates 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.390
