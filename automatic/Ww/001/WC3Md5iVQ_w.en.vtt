old<00:00:09.570> pioneer<00:00:10.080> premieres<00:00:10.500> these<00:00:11.370> are<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> ones

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
old pioneer premieres these are the ones

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.589 
old pioneer premieres these are the ones
I've<00:00:12.630> been<00:00:13.139> buying<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.059> I'd<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> buy

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I've been buying and I'd like to buy

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.810 
I've been buying and I'd like to buy
more<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:18.830> start<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> differences

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
more of so start with the differences

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.259 
more of so start with the differences
first<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:22.550> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> tell<00:00:23.910> they're

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
first off you can tell they're

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.970 
first off you can tell they're
completely<00:00:24.810> different<00:00:25.289> looking<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
completely different looking from the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
completely different looking from the
face<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:30.349> if<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> look<00:00:31.880> these<00:00:32.880> Thrones<00:00:33.450> are

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
face and if you look these Thrones are

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.369 
face and if you look these Thrones are
actually<00:00:34.590> slightly<00:00:35.070> wider<00:00:35.700> than<00:00:36.380> these<00:00:37.380> ones

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.819 

the<00:00:43.379> biggest<00:00:43.770> difference<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
the biggest difference with them is that

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.020 
the biggest difference with them is that
these<00:00:46.829> subs<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:49.430> traditional<00:00:50.430> spider<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
these subs have a traditional spider in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.709 
these subs have a traditional spider in
them

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.910 

as<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> see

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
as you can see there and if you can see

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.869 
as you can see there and if you can see
in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> motor<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:01.489> top<00:01:02.489> plate

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
in the motor there it's got a top plate

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.480 
in the motor there it's got a top plate
with<00:01:03.210> fins<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:06.260> okay

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.530 

this<00:01:12.270> subwoofer<00:01:12.600> has<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:14.340> completely<00:01:14.909> sealed

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
this subwoofer has a completely sealed

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.040 
this subwoofer has a completely sealed
chamber<00:01:16.670> there's<00:01:17.670> no<00:01:17.909> spider<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:21.050> up

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
chamber there's no spider in it and up

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.680 
chamber there's no spider in it and up
in<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.159> hard<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.550> see<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
in here it's really hard to see but

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.660 
in here it's really hard to see but
there's<00:01:25.229> foam<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.780> another<00:01:28.140> surround

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
there's foam and it's another surround

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.749 
there's foam and it's another surround
cone<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:31.020> attaches<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.800> other<00:01:31.860> card<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
cone that attaches to the other card it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.040 
cone that attaches to the other card it
makes<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.270> v-shape<00:01:34.729> outer<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
makes like v-shape outer there and it's

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.990 
makes like v-shape outer there and it's
attached<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:37.680> surrounds<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:40.520> boom<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
attached by two surrounds so boom on

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.320 
attached by two surrounds so boom on
these<00:01:42.570> ones<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:43.679> all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.640> terminals<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
these ones they put all the terminals on

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.889 
these ones they put all the terminals on
one<00:01:45.509> side<00:01:46.550> these<00:01:47.550> four<00:01:47.880> terminals<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.750> each

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
one side these four terminals on each

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.610 
one side these four terminals on each
side

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.380 

well<00:01:56.620> yeah<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.460> they<00:01:57.760> are<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:57.940> lot<00:01:58.360> different

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
well yeah so they are a lot different

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.660 
well yeah so they are a lot different
subwoofers<00:01:59.350> they're<00:01:59.590> nowhere<00:01:59.980> near<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.430> same

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
subwoofers they're nowhere near the same

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.600 
subwoofers they're nowhere near the same
subwoofer<00:02:01.570> even<00:02:02.380> though<00:02:02.530> they're<00:02:02.770> rated<00:02:03.430> the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
subwoofer even though they're rated the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
subwoofer even though they're rated the
same<00:02:03.790> power<00:02:04.680> they're<00:02:05.680> totally<00:02:06.160> not<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.370> same

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
same power they're totally not the same

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.910 
same power they're totally not the same
this<00:02:08.680> subwoofer<00:02:09.479> actually<00:02:10.479> has<00:02:11.050> thicker<00:02:11.470> wire

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
this subwoofer actually has thicker wire

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400 
this subwoofer actually has thicker wire
and<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.640> voice<00:02:12.850> coil<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.420> hard<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.810> see<00:02:14.050> but

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and the voice coil it's hard to see but

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.480 
and the voice coil it's hard to see but
these<00:02:15.310> are<00:02:15.490> both<00:02:15.670> dual<00:02:16.150> 2-ohm<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:18.310> some

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
these are both dual 2-ohm and for some

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.160 
these are both dual 2-ohm and for some
reason<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.240> has<00:02:19.450> slightly<00:02:19.750> thicker

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
reason this one has slightly thicker

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.820 
reason this one has slightly thicker
wire<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:22.000> voice<00:02:22.210> coil<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.320> also<00:02:26.530> on

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
wire the voice coil and this is also on

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.000 
wire the voice coil and this is also on
a<00:02:26.860> titanium<00:02:27.310> former<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.870> subwoofer<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
a titanium former this subwoofer is on a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.760 
a titanium former this subwoofer is on a
captain<00:02:30.610> or<00:02:30.820> some<00:02:31.300> type<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.510> plastic<00:02:31.930> former

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
captain or some type of plastic former

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:41.730 
captain or some type of plastic former
it's<00:02:33.010> not<00:02:36.030> titanium<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.420> sub<00:02:40.680> they<00:02:41.680> do

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
it's not titanium like this sub they do

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.980 
it's not titanium like this sub they do
however<00:02:42.370> share<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.120> same<00:02:43.390> motor<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.840> noticed

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
however share the same motor I noticed

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.840 
however share the same motor I noticed
the<00:02:46.990> only<00:02:47.200> difference<00:02:47.590> being<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.100> top<00:02:48.520> plate

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the only difference being is top plate

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.180 
the only difference being is top plate
and<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:49.570> might<00:02:49.780> actually<00:02:50.020> have<00:02:50.260> same<00:02:51.160> top

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and they might actually have same top

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.030 
and they might actually have same top
plate<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.300> might<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.260> cover<00:02:53.890> over

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
plate this one might have a cover over

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.020 
plate this one might have a cover over
the<00:02:54.340> top<00:02:54.490> plate<00:02:55.000> that's<00:02:55.600> bolted<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.230> because

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the top plate that's bolted on because

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.490 
the top plate that's bolted on because
see<00:02:58.030> there's<00:02:58.269> some<00:02:58.420> bolts<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.900> there<00:02:59.080> holding

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
see there's some bolts in there holding

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.620 
see there's some bolts in there holding
them<00:02:59.650> down

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.560 

and<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.680> magnets<00:03:07.160> actually<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> square

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
and the magnets actually have a square

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.550 
and the magnets actually have a square
top<00:03:08.930> plate<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.680> see<00:03:10.090> square<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.290> these

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
top plate you can see square and these

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040 
top plate you can see square and these
don't<00:03:12.860> look<00:03:12.980> like<00:03:13.160> they<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.420> I'm

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
don't look like they have that so I'm

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.530 
don't look like they have that so I'm
