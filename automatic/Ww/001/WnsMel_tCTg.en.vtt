00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.670 

okay<00:00:01.500> what<00:00:01.680> we<00:00:01.770> have<00:00:01.800> here<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> 97<00:00:03.529> f250<00:00:04.529> with

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay what we have here is a 97 f250 with

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.179 
okay what we have here is a 97 f250 with
a<00:00:04.710> 5-4<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> 97<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.069> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
a 5-4 in it this is a 97 so it's just a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.150 
a 5-4 in it this is a 97 so it's just a
3<00:00:08.760> or<00:00:08.940> 2<00:00:09.120> valve<00:00:09.360> 5-4<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.769> had<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
3 or 2 valve 5-4 and what we had is a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
3 or 2 valve 5-4 and what we had is a
complaint<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.179> running<00:00:12.360> rough<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
complaint of it running rough and the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.220 
complaint of it running rough and the
check<00:00:13.320> engine<00:00:13.349> light<00:00:13.769> was<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.299> check<00:00:16.199> for

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
check engine light was on so check for

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
check engine light was on so check for
codes<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.980> sure<00:00:17.279> enough<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.789> code<00:00:17.970> for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
codes and sure enough there's a code for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
codes and sure enough there's a code for
number<00:00:18.539> 7<00:00:18.869> cylinder<00:00:19.289> misfire

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
number 7 cylinder misfire

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
number 7 cylinder misfire
so<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.970> did<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.960> went

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
so what we did was first of all we went

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.970 
so what we did was first of all we went
to<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:23.779> cylinder<00:00:24.779> contribution<00:00:25.529> test<00:00:25.769> which

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to a cylinder contribution test which

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.089 
to a cylinder contribution test which
seems<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:27.470> supported<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
seems to be supported on this with the

virus<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> here's<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:38.129> if

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
virus and here's what we got now if

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
virus and here's what we got now if
you're<00:00:38.430> you're<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.210> tired<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you're you're really tired of it if you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
you're you're really tired of it if you
really<00:00:40.350> having<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> hard<00:00:40.829> time<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> 10-4

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really having a hard time with the 10-4

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.030 
really having a hard time with the 10-4
I'll<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.090> show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.570> trick<00:00:42.870> here

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
I'll just show you a little trick here

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.260 
I'll just show you a little trick here
and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.160> took<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> little<00:00:45.000> while<00:00:45.149> ago

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and I just took this a little while ago

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.660 
and I just took this a little while ago
this<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.129> filling<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> contribution

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this here is our filling a contribution

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
this here is our filling a contribution
test<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:48.600> problem<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.260> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
test and the only problem we have is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.889 
test and the only problem we have is
right<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> startup<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.780> had

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
right here right up on startup we had

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
right here right up on startup we had
number<00:00:52.289> 6<00:00:52.559> cylinder<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
number 6 cylinder had a little bit of a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.330 
number 6 cylinder had a little bit of a
misfire<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.870> other<00:00:55.020> than<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.230> even<00:00:56.160> though

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
misfire but other than that even though

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.650 
misfire but other than that even though
this<00:00:56.460> thing's<00:00:56.670> running<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.120> crap<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this thing's running like crap and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.770 
this thing's running like crap and
there's<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.620> obvious<00:00:58.770> misfire<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> cylinder

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
there's an obvious misfire the cylinder

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
there's an obvious misfire the cylinder
contribution<00:01:01.440> test<00:01:01.680> isn't<00:01:01.949> isn't

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
contribution test isn't isn't

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
contribution test isn't isn't
necessarily<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> catch<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.589> even

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
necessarily going to catch it and I even

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
necessarily going to catch it and I even
did<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> break<00:01:05.640> torque<00:01:05.939> here

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
did a little bit of a break torque here

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
did a little bit of a break torque here
and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.299> still<00:01:06.510> couldn't<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.960> about<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> only

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and I still couldn't get about the only

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
and I still couldn't get about the only
time<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.880> diving<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
time you get a little diving is when the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.289 
time you get a little diving is when the
AC<00:01:09.840> compressor<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.650> kick<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.040> you'll<00:01:11.220> see

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
AC compressor will kick in you'll see

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
AC compressor will kick in you'll see
whatever<00:01:12.299> cylinder<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.530> basically

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
whatever cylinder because it's basically

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499 
whatever cylinder because it's basically
going<00:01:14.010> by<00:01:14.189> crankshaft<00:01:14.700> speed<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.150> anything

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
going by crankshaft speed so anything

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
going by crankshaft speed so anything
that<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.810> temporarily<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that will temporarily make the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
that will temporarily make the
crankshaft<00:01:17.400> slow<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.659> such

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
crankshaft slow down a little bit such

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
crankshaft slow down a little bit such
as<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> air<00:01:19.350> conditioning<00:01:19.860> kicking<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.549> if

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
as the air conditioning kicking in or if

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.030 
as the air conditioning kicking in or if
you're<00:01:21.630> driving<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> shifts<00:01:22.590> gears<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you're driving it and shifts gears you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.719 
you're driving it and shifts gears you

or<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.270> under<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.659> another<00:01:27.840> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
or one and so under there another that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.390 
or one and so under there another that's
really<00:01:28.380> nothing<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.799> concerned<00:01:29.070> about

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really nothing to be concerned about

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
really nothing to be concerned about
what<00:01:30.090> you're<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.600> looking<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
what you're really looking for is a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.550 
what you're really looking for is a
cylinder<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> constant<00:01:33.560> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
cylinder that's got a constant that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
cylinder that's got a constant that
constantly<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> running<00:01:35.579> below<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.360> zero

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
constantly is running below the zero

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.280 
constantly is running below the zero
mark<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.390> had<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> look

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
mark here so what we had here if we look

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
mark here so what we had here if we look
at<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.920> cylinder<00:01:41.340> six<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.820> goes

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
at it we see on cylinder six it goes

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
at it we see on cylinder six it goes
down<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> initial

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

the number 7 coil and it's really easy
to<00:02:44.640> set<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.080> especially<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.709> because

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
to set up especially on this one because

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.390 
to set up especially on this one because
your<00:02:47.360> your<00:02:48.360> coil<00:02:48.840> feed<00:02:49.200> wire<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.920> main<00:02:50.130> coil

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
your your coil feed wire the main coil

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.040 
your your coil feed wire the main coil
supply<00:02:50.790> wire<00:02:51.030> comes<00:02:51.360> right<00:02:51.630> off<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> main

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
supply wire comes right off the main

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.760 
harness right here it's the red green
wire<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.930> pretty<00:02:55.170> easy<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> your

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
wire and it's pretty easy to get your

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.980 
wire and it's pretty easy to get your
amp<00:02:55.980> prober<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.940> by<00:02:57.450> doing<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
amp prober on that and by doing that you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.290 
amp prober on that and by doing that you
can<00:02:58.110> check<00:02:58.290> all<00:02:58.530> your<00:02:58.910> coils<00:02:59.910> at<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> same

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
can check all your coils at the same

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.600 
can check all your coils at the same
time<00:03:00.570> there's<00:03:00.810> another<00:03:00.870> wire<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.770> that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
time there's another wire in here that

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.670 
time there's another wire in here that
drives<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.270> your<00:03:03.480> injectors<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.590> do

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
drives all your injectors so you can do

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
drives all your injectors so you can do
the<00:03:04.830> same<00:03:05.040> thing<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:05.700> put<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.150> put

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the same thing there just put that put

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.390 
the same thing there just put that put
it<00:03:06.570> around<00:03:06.660> your<00:03:06.870> main<00:03:07.110> coil<00:03:07.410> your<00:03:08.250> main

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
it around your main coil your main

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.430 
it around your main coil your main
injector<00:03:08.580> wire<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.959> trigger<00:03:10.170> off

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
injector wire and then just trigger off

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.890 
injector wire and then just trigger off
at<00:03:10.650> any<00:03:10.770> one<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> injectors<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.780> you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
at any one of the injectors and then you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540 
at any one of the injectors and then you
just<00:03:13.140> set<00:03:13.320> up<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> suite<00:03:13.770> time<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.190> your<00:03:14.310> scope

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
just set up the suite time on your scope

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.520 
just set up the suite time on your scope
so<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:14.940> see<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.300> them<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.380> you've

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
so you can see all of them and you've

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.990 
so you can see all of them and you've
got<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.740> bad<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.130> you're<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:17.459> zero<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.880> on

gone<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.530> mode<00:03:25.800> 6<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.340> see<00:03:26.489> where<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> misfires

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
gone to mode 6 to see where the misfires

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.180 
gone to mode 6 to see where the misfires
are<00:03:27.390> occurring<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.230> go<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.560> back

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
are occurring you can just go on back

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
are occurring you can just go on back
probe<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.269> you'd<00:03:30.420> run<00:03:30.630> your

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
probe that one and then you'd run your

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.640 
probe that one and then you'd run your
your<00:03:31.650> trace<00:03:32.450> or<00:03:33.450> your<00:03:33.570> trigger<00:03:33.870> off<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.530> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
your trace or your trigger off of that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.110 
your trace or your trigger off of that
coil<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.280> we're<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.580> start<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.940> up

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
coil so we're going to start this up

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.460 
coil so we're going to start this up
here<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> minute<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.720> we'll<00:03:36.840> see<00:03:37.140> what's<00:03:37.320> wrong

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
here a minute and we'll see what's wrong

00:03:37.470 --> 00:04:05.020 
here a minute and we'll see what's wrong
with<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.850> coil

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.270 

oK<00:04:06.030> we've<00:04:06.930> got<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> good<00:04:07.380> capture<00:04:07.860> here<00:04:08.069> we<00:04:08.190> were

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
oK we've got a good capture here we were

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.699 
oK we've got a good capture here we were
on<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> 10<00:04:09.330> millisecond<00:04:09.990> screen<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:10.560> we

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
on a 10 millisecond screen so we

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.040 
on a 10 millisecond screen so we
probably<00:04:10.860> only<00:04:11.069> got<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.520> second<00:04:12.050> second

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
probably only got like a second second

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.300 
probably only got like a second second
and<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> half<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.620> time<00:04:14.600> recorded<00:04:15.600> here<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:17.160> can

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
and a half a time recorded here you can

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.539 
and a half a time recorded here you can
see<00:04:18.049> most<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.230> these<00:04:19.290> coils<00:04:19.620> while<00:04:20.190> what<00:04:20.370> we'll

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
see most of these coils while what we'll

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.110 
see most of these coils while what we'll
do<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.850> here<00:04:21.030> will<00:04:21.980> with<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.220> enlarge<00:04:23.700> button

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
do is here will with the enlarge button

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.510 
do is here will with the enlarge button
so<00:04:24.450> we<00:04:24.570> get<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:24.960> show<00:04:25.650> more<00:04:25.890> of<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.130> coils

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
so we get we can show more of the coils

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.730 
so we get we can show more of the coils
rather<00:04:27.360> than<00:04:27.540> just<00:04:27.720> one<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:27.960> we'll<00:04:28.230> try<00:04:28.470> go

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
rather than just one and we'll try go

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.290 
rather than just one and we'll try go
about<00:04:28.950> eight<00:04:29.220> times<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:31.200> we<00:04:31.320> got<00:04:32.180> while<00:04:33.180> we're

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
about eight times so we got while we're

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.770 
about eight times so we got while we're
showing<00:04:33.480> six<00:04:33.840> coils<00:04:34.110> here<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.650> here's<00:04:34.860> our

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
showing six coils here and here's our

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.180 
showing six coils here and here's our
this<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.960> our<00:04:37.080> trigger<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.860> here<00:04:38.070> would

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
this is our trigger so this here would

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.620 
this is our trigger so this here would
be<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.400> coil<00:04:38.730> we're<00:04:38.940> recording<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.480> you<00:04:39.570> can

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
be the coil we're recording and you can

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.659 
be the coil we're recording and you can
see<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:39.960> here<00:04:40.169> already<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.370> current

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
see it here already that the current

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.810 
see it here already that the current
ramped<00:04:41.880> on<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.300> here<00:04:42.830> coil<00:04:43.830> isn't<00:04:44.400> quite

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
ramped on this here coil isn't quite

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.310 
ramped on this here coil isn't quite
right<00:04:45.030> these<00:04:45.300> are<00:04:45.330> nice<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.660> steep<00:04:46.020> even

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
right these are nice and steep even

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.780 
right these are nice and steep even
though<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.530> got<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.710> pretty<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.400> got<00:04:47.550> an<00:04:47.640> 80

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
though we got a pretty we got an 80

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.090 
though we got a pretty we got an 80
millisecond<00:04:48.480> time<00:04:48.660> sweep<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.560> we<00:04:49.680> got<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.830> coil

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
millisecond time sweep and we got a coil

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.570 
millisecond time sweep and we got a coil
on<00:04:50.310> time<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.790> probably<00:04:51.060> only<00:04:51.270> 3<00:04:51.510> or<00:04:51.630> 4

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
on time of probably only 3 or 4

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.460 
on time of probably only 3 or 4
milliseconds<00:04:53.600> but<00:04:54.600> it's<00:04:54.750> enough<00:04:55.050> for<00:04:55.080> ready

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
milliseconds but it's enough for ready

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.110 
milliseconds but it's enough for ready
to<00:04:55.710> see<00:04:55.890> that<00:04:56.130> through<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.580> problem<00:04:57.000> right

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
to see that through the problem right

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.970 
to see that through the problem right
here<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.870> also<00:04:57.990> notice<00:04:58.169> here<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.860> our

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
here and you can also notice here in our

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.330 
here and you can also notice here in our
primary<00:04:59.760> voltage<00:05:00.480> that<00:05:00.870> there's<00:05:01.260> no<00:05:01.440> there's

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
primary voltage that there's no there's

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.250 
primary voltage that there's no there's
no<00:05:02.430> firing<00:05:02.970> line<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.510> so<00:05:03.930> we've<00:05:04.080> got<00:05:04.110> a

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
no firing line here so we've got a

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.560 
no firing line here so we've got a
problem<00:05:04.530> with<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.740> coil<00:05:05.160> but<00:05:06.030> just<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.360> show

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
problem with that coil but just to show

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.950 
problem with that coil but just to show
you<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> can<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:09.060> scroll<00:05:09.390> this<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.630> little

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
you here I can just scroll this a little

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.920 
you here I can just scroll this a little
bit<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.350> so<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:10.560> we're<00:05:11.060> looking<00:05:12.060> from<00:05:12.660> here

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
bit just so that we're looking from here

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.620 
bit just so that we're looking from here
you<00:05:13.350> can<00:05:13.470> trigger<00:05:13.680> off<00:05:13.860> at<00:05:14.010> any<00:05:14.130> coil<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.790> then

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
you can trigger off at any coil and then

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.630 
you can trigger off at any coil and then
you<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:16.020> go<00:05:16.140> by<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.380> firing<00:05:16.620> where<00:05:16.919> order

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
you just go by the firing where order

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.460 
you just go by the firing where order
and<00:05:17.820> zero<00:05:18.060> in<00:05:18.240> on<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.510> coil<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:19.200> would<00:05:19.320> like

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
and zero in on the coil you would like

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.960 
and zero in on the coil you would like
to<00:05:19.590> see<00:05:19.710> close<00:05:19.950> up<00:05:19.979> but<00:05:20.370> because<00:05:20.700> we<00:05:20.850> already

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
to see close up but because we already

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.280 
to see close up but because we already
knew<00:05:21.300> we<00:05:22.200> had<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.350> problem<00:05:22.410> with<00:05:22.919> number<00:05:23.280> seven

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
knew we had a problem with number seven

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.230 
knew we had a problem with number seven
we<00:05:25.290> just<00:05:25.560> went<00:05:26.100> back<00:05:26.220> probe<00:05:26.669> that<00:05:26.850> one<00:05:27.060> right

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
we just went back probe that one right

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.610 
we just went back probe that one right
away<00:05:27.360> but<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:27.720> could<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.020> back<00:05:28.320> probe

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
away but you could just back probe

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.200 
away but you could just back probe
number<00:05:28.919> one<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:29.310> just<00:05:29.340> follow<00:05:29.669> firing

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
number one and then just follow firing

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.810 
number one and then just follow firing
order<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:31.020> where<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.200> see<00:05:31.380> your<00:05:31.790> either<00:05:32.790> a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
order to where you see your either a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.400 
order to where you see your either a
missing<00:05:33.180> current<00:05:33.479> ramp<00:05:33.660> or<00:05:33.870> current<00:05:34.229> ramp

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
missing current ramp or current ramp

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.110 
missing current ramp or current ramp
that<00:05:34.560> doesn't<00:05:34.919> look<00:05:35.040> quite<00:05:35.310> right<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:36.060> you

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
that doesn't look quite right and you

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.300 
that doesn't look quite right and you
can<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:37.260> can<00:05:37.440> change<00:05:37.680> this<00:05:37.830> any<00:05:38.010> way<00:05:38.160> you<00:05:38.190> want

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
can you can change this any way you want

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.540 
can you can change this any way you want
go<00:05:38.640> to<00:05:38.669> 2<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.300> we<00:05:39.390> got<00:05:39.540> about<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.919> 20<00:05:40.919> millisecond

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
go to 2 so we got about a 20 millisecond

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.840 
go to 2 so we got about a 20 millisecond
screen<00:05:41.850> here<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.370> should<00:05:44.520> be<00:05:44.640> enough

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
screen here and that should be enough

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.510 
screen here and that should be enough
here<00:05:45.180> where<00:05:45.479> we<00:05:46.260> bring<00:05:46.590> up<00:05:49.220> bring<00:05:50.220> up<00:05:50.340> our

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
here where we bring up bring up our

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.779 
here where we bring up bring up our
number<00:05:51.450> 7<00:05:51.810> coil<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.800> we<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.039> see<00:05:53.190> our<00:05:53.340> current

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
number 7 coil and we can see our current

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.350 
number 7 coil and we can see our current
ramp<00:05:54.120> here<00:05:54.419> has<00:05:54.630> got<00:05:54.840> a<00:05:54.870> dive<00:05:55.140> in<00:05:55.410> it<00:05:56.120> it's<00:05:57.120> not

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
ramp here has got a dive in it it's not

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.440 
ramp here has got a dive in it it's not
it<00:05:57.990> should<00:05:58.260> be<00:05:58.490> like<00:05:59.490> this<00:05:59.669> should<00:05:59.940> be<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.150> nice

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
it should be like this should be a nice

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.990 
it should be like this should be a nice
steady<00:06:00.810> climb<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:01.410> she<00:06:02.070> Peaks<00:06:02.340> up<00:06:02.550> right<00:06:02.760> away

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
steady climb and she Peaks up right away

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.090 
steady climb and she Peaks up right away
and<00:06:03.060> kind<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.600> drifts<00:06:03.960> over<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:04.830> we're<00:06:04.979> not

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
and kind of drifts over so we're not

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.870 
and kind of drifts over so we're not
getting<00:06:05.280> enough<00:06:05.850> energy<00:06:06.060> into<00:06:06.600> this<00:06:06.720> coil<00:06:07.050> to

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
getting enough energy into this coil to

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.420 
getting enough energy into this coil to
develop<00:06:08.880> a<00:06:08.970> firing<00:06:09.360> line<00:06:09.800> if<00:06:10.800> there<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.190> it's

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
develop a firing line if there is it's

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.469 
develop a firing line if there is it's
very<00:06:11.820> very<00:06:12.090> short<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:14.030> at<00:06:15.030> least<00:06:15.120> we<00:06:15.330> know

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
very very short so at least we know

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:15.890 
very very short so at least we know
where<00:06:15.690> to

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
where to

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.990 
where to
we<00:06:16.080> can<00:06:16.229> pull<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:16.530> coil<00:06:16.770> now<00:06:17.250> and<00:06:17.460> check<00:06:17.850> the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
we can pull that coil now and check the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.330 
we can pull that coil now and check the
boot<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.750> check<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.259> coil<00:06:19.590> probably<00:06:19.979> replace

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
boot and check the coil probably replace

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.370 
boot and check the coil probably replace
the<00:06:20.520> coil<00:06:20.759> anyways<00:06:21.210> take<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.960> look<00:06:22.169> at<00:06:22.290> the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
the coil anyways take a look at the

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.960 
the coil anyways take a look at the
spark<00:06:22.680> plug<00:06:22.889> make<00:06:23.100> sure<00:06:23.250> we're<00:06:23.430> not<00:06:23.460> running

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
spark plug make sure we're not running

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.779 
spark plug make sure we're not running
down<00:06:24.650> the<00:06:25.650> side<00:06:25.830> of<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.070> ceramic<00:06:26.699> or

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
down the side of the ceramic or

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.270 
down the side of the ceramic or
something<00:06:27.210> shorting<00:06:27.720> out<00:06:27.810> but<00:06:28.080> anything<00:06:29.070> even

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
something shorting out but anything even

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.029 
something shorting out but anything even
that's<00:06:29.550> just<00:06:29.880> pissed<00:06:30.630> away<00:06:30.840> to<00:06:30.990> a<00:06:32.270> quick<00:06:33.270> path

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
that's just pissed away to a quick path

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.100 
that's just pissed away to a quick path
to<00:06:35.039> zeroing<00:06:35.430> in<00:06:35.580> on<00:06:35.699> which<00:06:35.910> coil<00:06:36.360> or<00:06:36.720> which

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
to zeroing in on which coil or which

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.260 
to zeroing in on which coil or which
cylinder<00:06:37.650> is<00:06:37.710> giving<00:06:38.009> you<00:06:38.100> the<00:06:38.220> problem<00:06:38.639> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
cylinder is giving you the problem and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.060 
cylinder is giving you the problem and
obviously<00:06:39.750> when<00:06:40.259> you<00:06:40.350> get<00:06:40.560> a<00:06:40.590> current<00:06:40.830> ramp

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
obviously when you get a current ramp

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.189 
obviously when you get a current ramp
like<00:06:41.220> this<00:06:41.280> you've<00:06:41.639> got<00:06:41.850> a<00:06:41.880> you've<00:06:42.690> got<00:06:42.720> a<00:06:42.900> coil

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
like this you've got a you've got a coil

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.469 
like this you've got a you've got a coil
problem<00:06:43.680> but<00:06:43.800> we<00:06:43.919> may<00:06:44.100> have<00:06:44.130> a<00:06:44.310> will<00:06:45.270> take<00:06:45.449> a

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
problem but we may have a will take a

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.060 
problem but we may have a will take a
good<00:06:45.690> look<00:06:45.840> at<00:06:46.020> that<00:06:46.050> plug<00:06:46.410> -<00:06:46.650> just<00:06:46.919> to<00:06:47.009> make

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
good look at that plug - just to make

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.010 
good look at that plug - just to make
sure<00:06:47.370> because<00:06:47.639> even<00:06:48.419> with<00:06:48.539> that<00:06:48.660> much<00:06:48.840> energy

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
sure because even with that much energy

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.570 
sure because even with that much energy
you'd<00:06:49.350> think<00:06:49.500> he'd<00:06:49.710> still<00:06:49.949> get<00:06:50.100> a<00:06:50.160> little<00:06:50.430> bit

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
you'd think he'd still get a little bit

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.300 
you'd think he'd still get a little bit
of<00:06:50.669> a<00:06:50.850> a<00:06:51.060> little<00:06:52.020> bit<00:06:52.169> of<00:06:52.289> a<00:06:52.410> firing<00:06:52.680> line<00:06:52.860> there

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
of a a little bit of a firing line there

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.060 
of a a little bit of a firing line there
but<00:06:53.940> she<00:06:54.300> just<00:06:54.479> Peaks<00:06:54.750> up<00:06:54.960> and<00:06:55.169> there's<00:06:55.320> no<00:06:55.470> no

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
but she just Peaks up and there's no no

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.939 
but she just Peaks up and there's no no
burn<00:06:56.310> time<00:06:56.639> whatsoever<00:06:57.060> on<00:06:57.449> this<00:06:57.630> so<00:06:58.020> I<00:06:58.289> guess

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
burn time whatsoever on this so I guess

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.449 
burn time whatsoever on this so I guess
that's<00:06:59.100> about<00:06:59.280> it<00:06:59.400> during<00:07:00.240> this<00:07:00.510> one<00:07:02.449> okay
