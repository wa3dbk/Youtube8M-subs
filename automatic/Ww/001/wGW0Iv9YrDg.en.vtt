00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
tomato in the center of this because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.200 
tomato in the center of this because
it's<00:01:45.200> large<00:01:45.440> enough<00:01:45.530> or<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.040> could<00:01:46.760> take<00:01:46.880> one<00:01:47.090> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
vegetable curler now I'm going to try
peeling<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.300> yam<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.540> see<00:02:50.870> what<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.340> there

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
peeling it yam and see what we get there

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.170 
peeling it yam and see what we get there
it<00:02:52.520> is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.370 

it<00:02:56.180> actually<00:02:56.360> looks<00:02:56.720> kind<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.020> pretty<00:02:57.200> with

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
it actually looks kind of pretty with

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.300 
it actually looks kind of pretty with
those<00:02:57.530> edges<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.290> I've<00:03:00.440> taken<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.920> zucchini

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
those edges now I've taken a zucchini

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.850 
those edges now I've taken a zucchini
and<00:03:01.580> I've<00:03:01.730> scored<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.810> sides<00:03:03.110> by<00:03:03.500> cutting

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
and I've scored the sides by cutting

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.120 
and I've scored the sides by cutting
these<00:03:04.010> slits<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.260> let's<00:03:06.260> take<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> look<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
these slits and let's take a look and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:19.540 
these slits and let's take a look and
see<00:03:07.340> what<00:03:07.520> happens<00:03:08.890> when<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.040> curl<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:18.550> maybe

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
see what happens when we curl this maybe

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.460 
see what happens when we curl this maybe
we<00:03:19.670> want<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.000> center<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.450> be<00:03:20.570> curled<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.230> little

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
we want the center to be curled a little

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.980 
we want the center to be curled a little
bit<00:03:21.590> tighter<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:26.000> outside<00:03:26.480> curled<00:03:26.870> a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
bit tighter and the outside curled a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.640 
bit tighter and the outside curled a
little<00:03:27.230> bit<00:03:27.380> looser<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:33.290> there<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:33.620> go

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
little bit looser there so there we go

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.940 
little bit looser there so there we go
another<00:03:34.010> variation<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.660> zucchini<00:03:36.050> flower

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.230 

now<00:03:39.950> you've<00:03:40.100> seen<00:03:40.370> how<00:03:40.520> easily<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.120> quickly

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
now you've seen how easily and quickly

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.300 
now you've seen how easily and quickly
you<00:03:41.840> can<00:03:41.990> make<00:03:42.170> pretty<00:03:42.380> vegetable<00:03:42.950> flowers

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
you can make pretty vegetable flowers

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.730 
you can make pretty vegetable flowers
using<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.030> large<00:03:44.240> vegetable<00:03:44.780> curler<00:03:45.020> we've

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
using the large vegetable curler we've

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.040 
using the large vegetable curler we've
done<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.130> using<00:03:46.400> yellow<00:03:46.610> squash<00:03:47.000> we've<00:03:47.840> added

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
done it using yellow squash we've added

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.290 
done it using yellow squash we've added
carrot<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.710> center<00:03:49.100> we've<00:03:49.730> got<00:03:49.970> several

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
carrot in the center we've got several

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.840 
carrot in the center we've got several
different<00:03:50.810> looks<00:03:50.960> with<00:03:51.260> zucchini<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.980> we

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
different looks with zucchini and we

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.870 
different looks with zucchini and we
experimented<00:03:53.450> with<00:03:53.870> yams<00:03:54.800> unpeeled<00:03:55.550> and

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
experimented with yams unpeeled and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.360 
experimented with yams unpeeled and
peeled<00:03:56.540> with<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> wavy<00:03:57.200> peeler<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:58.310> you

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
peeled with the wavy peeler now you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.950 
peeled with the wavy peeler now you
might<00:03:58.670> notice<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.150> there's<00:03:59.360> some<00:03:59.570> larger

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
might notice that there's some larger

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.600 
might notice that there's some larger
holes<00:04:00.230> we<00:04:00.950> could<00:04:01.130> fill<00:04:01.370> those<00:04:01.580> holes<00:04:01.940> with<00:04:02.660> a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
holes we could fill those holes with a

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.390 
holes we could fill those holes with a
melon<00:04:04.610> ball<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.450> fruit<00:04:05.660> or<00:04:05.780> vegetable<00:04:05.960> or<00:04:06.500> a
