00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.090
 and 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.660
 and the one now 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.369
 of everything 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.100
 and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 let's start by joining some of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.140
 our dry ingredients 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.200
 slow 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.019
 and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.760
 in another container we are going to peel 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.570
 our bananas and let's make a puree 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.570
 with them 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 do not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.979
 d 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.570
 after no piece is left 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.570
 without crushing let's add the sugar 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.090
 but no 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.370
 and our whole egg 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.160
 with the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.700
 we melt the butter in the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.350
 microwave for 20 seconds then the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.350
 we are part of the mixture 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.020
 we join the ingredients separately in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.549
 the different containers now we are going to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.549
 put everything together 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.629
 our mix is now ready now 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.060
 we are going to order them to corridors in 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.060
 where are we going to make our cupcakes 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 so as not to make a disaster we are going to 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.470
 align our pastry sleeve with 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.080
 our mix and we will be doing the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.080
 cupcakes filling them halfway 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.170
 but he 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.209
 I'm going to use a common cake mold and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.799
 current and there will stop all 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.799
 to put them in the oven 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.530
 it will take 10 to 15 minutes in 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.530
 be ready 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 and you 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.629
 when your house starts reading as a 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.890
 banana cake is that the ponguetos 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.890
 they are ready 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.900
 to decorate them I'm going to use a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.820
 cream cheese frosting and a sleeve this 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.650
 next is already made for the box 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.290
 information I'll write you how to do 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.640
 some super easy and fast 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.640
 of the 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.260
 with the sleeve we are going to throw the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.810
 frosting making circular movements 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.730
 from the outside in when we arrived 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.170
 in the top part we will try to 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.170
 lift the piquito 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.819
 and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.180
 and that's what we're going to do with 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 all our cupcakes 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.810
 to make everything a little more festive 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.330
 I'm going to apply good color nuggets 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.170
 there are no red and green colors on 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.170
 everyone 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.940
 and already our cupcakes are ready to 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.770
 leave them to sanz is next to 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.770
 little tree on this poinsettia 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.790

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.669

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.150

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.500
