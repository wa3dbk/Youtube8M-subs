recently<00:00:22.230> released<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:23.220> gonna<00:00:23.310> be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
recently released we're gonna be

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
recently released we're gonna be
checking<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.269> clean<00:00:24.689> electric

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
checking it out on a clean electric

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980 
checking it out on a clean electric
guitar<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.769> vocals<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> without<00:00:27.480> further<00:00:27.630> ado

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
guitar and vocals so without further ado

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.820 
guitar and vocals so without further ado
let's<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
let's get to it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
let's get to it
for<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.820> electric<00:00:30.240> guitar<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.750> wanted<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
for this electric guitar we wanted to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
for this electric guitar we wanted to
use<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> N<00:00:31.590> 90<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.160> even<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> volume<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
use the N 90 to even out the volume and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.479 
use the N 90 to even out the volume and
provide<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.780> fullness<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:35.010> slower<00:00:35.280> attack

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
provide some fullness the slower attack

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
provide some fullness the slower attack
time<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.059> 15<00:00:36.450> milliseconds<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
time of 15 milliseconds let's the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
time of 15 milliseconds let's the
initial<00:00:37.860> transient<00:00:38.250> still<00:00:38.550> come<00:00:38.760> through<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
initial transient still come through and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
initial transient still come through and
the<00:00:39.660> release<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.140> set<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.800> Ross<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the release is set in time with Ross is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
the release is set in time with Ross is
playing<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.210> second<00:00:42.710> we<00:00:43.710> found

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
playing at about one second we found

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
playing at about one second we found
that<00:00:44.100> extra<00:00:44.399> saturation<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> Phoenix

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that extra saturation of the Phoenix

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.090 
that extra saturation of the Phoenix
output<00:00:45.809> transformer<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.710> helped<00:00:46.980> add

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
output transformer really helped add

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860 
output transformer really helped add
some<00:00:47.340> warmth<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.730> extra<00:00:48.059> depth<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.719> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
some warmth and extra depth to make this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:01:18.800 
some warmth and extra depth to make this
electric<00:00:49.320> pop

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.480 

yeah<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:19.840> think<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.619> example<00:01:20.829> really

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
yeah I think this example really

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.880 
yeah I think this example really
highlights<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.780> harmonic<00:01:23.259> content<00:01:23.680> that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
highlights the the harmonic content that

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.190 
highlights the the harmonic content that
like<00:01:24.070> subtle<00:01:24.310> saturation<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
like subtle saturation that just

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.719 
like subtle saturation that just
enhances<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.920> material<00:01:27.340> running<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.700> through

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
enhances the material running it through

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.459 
enhances the material running it through
really<00:01:28.030> well<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.360> mean<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.810> compression<00:01:29.380> is

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
really well I mean the compression is

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.230 
really well I mean the compression is
obviously<00:01:29.770> very<00:01:30.070> smooth<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.640> very<00:01:30.820> natural

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
obviously very smooth and very natural

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.149 
obviously very smooth and very natural
and<00:01:31.329> a<00:01:31.420> great<00:01:31.659> sound<00:01:31.869> but<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.799> extra

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and a great sound but that that extra

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.950 
and a great sound but that that extra
saturation<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.329> helps<00:01:34.600> take<00:01:34.780> this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
saturation really helps take this

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200 
saturation really helps take this
electric<00:01:35.649> guitar<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.189> was<00:01:36.549> okay<00:01:36.850> from

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
electric guitar that was okay from

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.760 
electric guitar that was okay from
starting<00:01:37.539> off<00:01:37.720> but<00:01:37.990> kind<00:01:38.289> of<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> next

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
starting off but kind of to the next

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.440 
starting off but kind of to the next
level<00:01:39.039> yeah<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.280> mean<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:39.759> that's<00:01:40.060> kind<00:01:40.420> of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
level yeah I mean that's that's kind of

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.999 
level yeah I mean that's that's kind of
a<00:01:40.569> key<00:01:40.780> thing<00:01:40.810> about<00:01:41.140> all<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.649> products

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
a key thing about all the products

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.100 
a key thing about all the products
really<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:43.119> output<00:01:43.509> stage<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.049> the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
really is the output stage and the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.109 
really is the output stage and the
transformer<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.799> basically<00:01:45.399> we<00:01:45.579> can<00:01:45.789> drive

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
transformer that basically we can drive

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.359 
transformer that basically we can drive
all<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.929> units<00:01:47.259> particularly<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:47.860> these<00:01:48.069> and

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
all the units particularly on these and

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.279 
all the units particularly on these and
just<00:01:48.789> kind<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.090> add<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.420> extra<00:01:49.780> car<00:01:50.020> that

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
just kind of add the extra car that

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.289 
just kind of add the extra car that
extra<00:01:50.590> saturation<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.459> make<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.789> sound<00:01:52.060> and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
extra saturation just make it sound and

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.270 
extra saturation just make it sound and
feel<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> little<00:01:53.020> nicer<00:01:53.530> let's<00:01:54.009> check<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:54.250> out

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
feel a little nicer let's check it out

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
feel a little nicer let's check it out
one<00:01:54.429> more<00:01:54.580> time<00:01:54.610> by<00:01:54.909> personal<00:01:55.450> engagement

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:25.780 

you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.949 

sweet<00:02:26.790> surfer<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.239> vocal<00:02:27.630> what<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.870> we

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
sweet surfer this vocal what are we

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.930 
sweet surfer this vocal what are we
looking<00:02:28.230> at<00:02:28.349> okay<00:02:29.220> well<00:02:29.430> again<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
looking at okay well again the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
looking at okay well again the
compression<00:02:30.450> section<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.230> white<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.739> terms

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
compression section is in white in terms

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.360 
compression section is in white in terms
of<00:02:32.220> threshold<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.209> have<00:02:33.390> more<00:02:33.630> threshold<00:02:34.370> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
of threshold we have more threshold so

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.059 
of threshold we have more threshold so
it's<00:02:35.520> more<00:02:35.760> towards<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:37.140> right-hand<00:02:37.349> side<00:02:37.770> we

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
it's more towards the right-hand side we

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.270 
it's more towards the right-hand side we
have<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.670> little<00:02:39.209> more<00:02:39.330> ratio<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.380> we<00:02:41.010> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
have a little more ratio as well we have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.610 
have a little more ratio as well we have
the<00:02:41.459> fast<00:02:41.760> switch<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.110> means<00:02:43.290> gives

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the fast switch down so it means gives
