00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
crew color what should happen is your

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.440 
crew color what should happen is your

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
matte color transfers over to the yellow

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.449 
matte color transfers over to the yellow
color<00:02:07.780> making<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.320> look<00:02:08.440> very<00:02:08.739> nice<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.100> a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
banana again anyway to make the color

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160 
banana again anyway to make the color
more<00:02:15.310> smoother<00:02:16.030> I'd<00:02:16.300> suggest<00:02:16.540> adding<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
more smoother I'd suggest adding a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.170 
more smoother I'd suggest adding a
secondary<00:02:17.620> color<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.100> yellow<00:02:18.310> or<00:02:18.640> ice<00:02:18.880> white

secondary color of yellow or ice white

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.449 
secondary color of yellow or ice white
