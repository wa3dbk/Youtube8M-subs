today I'm going to show you how I cook a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.370 
today I'm going to show you how I cook a
leg<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.809> lamb

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
leg of lamb

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.159 
leg of lamb
now<00:00:16.040> you<00:00:16.099> can<00:00:16.700> vacuum<00:00:16.970> seal<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.540> entire<00:00:17.869> leg

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
now you can vacuum seal the entire leg

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.099 
now you can vacuum seal the entire leg
of<00:00:18.349> lamb<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.950> cook<00:00:19.520> it<00:00:19.699> in<00:00:19.730> 130<00:00:20.449> degree<00:00:20.840> water

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
of lamb and cook it in 130 degree water

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.279 
of lamb and cook it in 130 degree water
bath<00:00:21.500> 55<00:00:22.310> degrees<00:00:22.670> Celsius<00:00:23.150> water<00:00:23.390> bath<00:00:23.630> for

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.910 
bath 55 degrees Celsius water bath for
24<00:00:24.800> hours<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:25.970> weird<00:00:26.840> is<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.019> family<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.619> three

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
24 hours but weird is a family of three

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.560 
24 hours but weird is a family of three
so<00:00:28.099> I'm<00:00:28.220> going<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.519> cut<00:00:28.699> up<00:00:28.849> into<00:00:29.060> smaller

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
so I'm going to cut up into smaller

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.540 
so I'm going to cut up into smaller
portions<00:00:31.360> you<00:00:32.360> don't<00:00:32.509> need<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.519> netting<00:00:34.519> that

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
portions you don't need the netting that

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.450 
portions you don't need the netting that
usually<00:00:35.089> comes<00:00:35.330> in<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:36.890> just<00:00:36.949> bought<00:00:37.250> and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
usually comes in this I just bought and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.030 
usually comes in this I just bought and
it<00:00:37.519> happened<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.850> be<00:00:37.909> boneless<00:00:38.710> so<00:00:39.710> I'm<00:00:39.799> going

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
it happened to be boneless so I'm going

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.820 
it happened to be boneless so I'm going
to<00:00:40.100> cut<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.430> into<00:00:40.640> two<00:00:40.790> halves<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.710> then<00:00:42.710> I'm

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
to cut it into two halves and then I'm

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.170 
to cut it into two halves and then I'm
going<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.100> cut<00:00:43.220> each<00:00:43.339> of<00:00:43.489> these<00:00:43.580> halves<00:00:43.879> in

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
going to cut each of these halves in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.070 
going to cut each of these halves in
half<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.750> this<00:00:45.409> will<00:00:45.559> give<00:00:45.739> us<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:46.100> nice

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
half and this will give us a nice

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.340 
half and this will give us a nice
weekend<00:00:48.080> meal<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.629> I've<00:00:50.690> sliced<00:00:50.989> up<00:00:51.229> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
weekend meal now that I've sliced up the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.140 
weekend meal now that I've sliced up the
lamb<00:00:51.559> I'm<00:00:52.040> going<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.400> put<00:00:52.549> them<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.790> my<00:00:52.909> vacuum

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
lamb I'm going to put them in my vacuum

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.100 
lamb I'm going to put them in my vacuum
bags<00:00:53.659> I've<00:00:54.440> turned<00:00:54.949> over<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.879> top<00:00:56.510> edge<00:00:56.809> so

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
bags I've turned over the top edge so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.439 
bags I've turned over the top edge so
that<00:00:57.229> will<00:00:57.470> remain<00:00:57.710> dry<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:58.909> don't<00:00:59.119> have<00:00:59.299> to

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
that will remain dry so I don't have to

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.170 
that will remain dry so I don't have to
worry<00:00:59.690> about<00:00:59.809> it<00:01:00.260> not<00:01:00.440> sealing<00:01:00.799> correctly<00:01:01.460> it

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
worry about it not sealing correctly it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.420 
worry about it not sealing correctly it
also<00:01:02.390> opens<00:01:02.960> up<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.170> bag<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:03.890> easier<00:01:04.400> for

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
also opens up the bag so it's easier for

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:14.410 
also opens up the bag so it's easier for
me<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.760> insert<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.750> lamb<00:01:12.700> hello<00:01:13.730> welcome<00:01:14.210> back

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
for 24 hours I'm going to convert much

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.700 
for 24 hours I'm going to convert much
of<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.820> collagen<00:01:47.420> that's<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.229> which<00:01:48.680> is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
of the collagen that's in it which is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.950 
of the collagen that's in it which is
what<00:01:48.950> makes<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.340> tough<00:01:49.520> into<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.630> much<00:01:50.810> more

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
tender gelatin this is not unlike when

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.230 
tender gelatin this is not unlike when
