that we did this is Belarus and this is
actually<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.820> sample<00:01:01.750> library<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.710> want<00:01:03.220> to

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
actually a sample library that I want to

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
actually a sample library that I want to
make<00:01:03.970> wing<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.540> all<00:01:04.660> my<00:01:04.809> friends<00:01:05.730> who<00:01:06.730> always

piano in my studio is so finally I

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.120 
piano in my studio is so finally I
decided<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.370> sample<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:17.050> now<00:01:17.710> I'm<00:01:17.920> going

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
decided to sample it and now I'm going

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.030 
decided to sample it and now I'm going
to<00:01:18.340> show<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.820> bit<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:20.740> playing

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
to show you a bit of it just by playing

00:01:21.040 --> 00:02:45.450 
to show you a bit of it just by playing
around

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.230 

now<00:02:46.460> another<00:02:46.880> neat<00:02:47.240> option<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.790> mod

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
now another neat option is that the mod

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.740 
now another neat option is that the mod
wheel<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.780> actually<00:02:51.080> controlling<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.750> filter

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
wheel is actually controlling a filter

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.840 
wheel is actually controlling a filter
low-pass<00:02:54.740> filters<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:55.760> always<00:02:56.390> play

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
low-pass filters so you can always play

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.970 
low-pass filters so you can always play
for<00:02:58.850> instance<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.720> this<00:03:00.110> type<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> bright

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
for instance this this type of bright

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:11.470 
for instance this this type of bright
piano<00:03:07.570> but<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:08.930> always<00:03:09.350> switch<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.480> say

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
piano but you can always switch to say

00:03:11.480 --> 00:04:18.469 
piano but you can always switch to say
something<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.930> this

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.070 

also<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.539> can<00:04:19.870> always<00:04:21.360> overlay<00:04:22.360> orchestral

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
also you can always overlay orchestral

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.680 
also you can always overlay orchestral
piano<00:04:23.350> with<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:23.800> because<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:25.000> really<00:04:25.030> has

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
piano with this because it really has

00:04:25.690 --> 00:05:09.459 
piano with this because it really has
this<00:04:25.840> low-end<00:04:26.770> that<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.310> very<00:04:27.699> epic

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.050 

and<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:11.669> interface<00:05:12.270> has<00:05:12.539> two<00:05:13.199> options<00:05:14.060> the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
and the interface has two options the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.209 
and the interface has two options the
piano<00:05:15.330> has<00:05:15.539> six<00:05:15.900> dynamic<00:05:16.319> layers<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.889> one

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
piano has six dynamic layers and one

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.610 
piano has six dynamic layers and one
round-robin<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:18.659> I<00:05:18.840> for<00:05:19.229> instance<00:05:19.379> play

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
round-robin so if I for instance play

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.980 
round-robin so if I for instance play
like<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:21.259> you<00:05:22.259> can<00:05:22.469> hear<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.669> sample<00:05:24.120> but<00:05:24.449> if

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
like this you can hear the sample but if

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.989 
like this you can hear the sample but if
you<00:05:25.169> click<00:05:25.319> on<00:05:25.379> around<00:05:26.189> trouble<00:05:26.550> mode<00:05:26.699> it

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
you click on around trouble mode it

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:41.089 
you click on around trouble mode it
borrows<00:05:27.599> samples<00:05:28.409> from<00:05:30.050> next<00:05:31.050> tones<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:40.099> of

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
borrows samples from next tones and of

00:05:41.099 --> 00:06:01.129 
borrows samples from next tones and of
course<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:42.029> reverse<00:05:42.979> option

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.350 

and<00:06:02.909> this<00:06:03.909> is<00:06:04.089> Belarus<00:06:05.039> will<00:06:06.089> give<00:06:07.089> you<00:06:07.210> more
