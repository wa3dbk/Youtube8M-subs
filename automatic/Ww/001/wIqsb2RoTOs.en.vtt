00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.289
 Left of the Day 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.560
 I did it only 3 times 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 Hey 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.260
 Guam System Real Iran is that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.460
 There Honmairan 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.140
 I've tested Butter Alpha here 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.140
 It is not Honmaira there 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.180
 Nice guyz just there is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.079
 Nde have a new one kill and I 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:01.159
 It is a love of the applications that do not faint but I've done also serves as the verification 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:05.559
 1 I have tried a kill deck. This will make you walk even if you make you faint and make you faint. 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.559
 That I'm a person who 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.380
 I used this 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.290
 It is a one-kill application of the application that does not write a one- kill description It has been verified 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.960
 In a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.520
 With this guy 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 This guy 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.159
 If there is more than one enemy in it, cover them 2- In cooperation with the remaining 4 brothers to get a blow of that agroindustry 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.320
 Of the explosion through in order to attack 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:43.010
 Special Move Case Final Impact also home owner's back tomorrow Vegeta gt 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.500
 For example we used 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.450
 A simple combination that just brings only these two people from the clan number 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 is not it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.549
 After in is to 1500+ damage in that this gouache and vinegar are each other's effect 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.760
 It will be nice 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.409
 If there is only one house tree at home like pilaf machine 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.430
 If you only have one boss 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.970
 eh 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:17.990
 Well it is the guy 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:22.760
 I'm going to change it to a rare vegeta of gm 4 bullets etc. 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.500
 I had already finished the last trade of this year and I didn't feel like trading anymore 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.860
 But I want to trade it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.170
 Yup 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:35.250
 Gm 4 bullets so I want to trade a little layer 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.250
 It is not this 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.670
 In this turtle Sennin 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.040
 This is it 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:54.210
 At the beginning of the battle of the store Laozi At the start of the battle, both the hit points and the power are the powers of the fellows of 2 games or less 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.230
 And keep the guard 2000 up so as not to faint 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.230
 this 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 Oh dear 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.180
 I thought to use it and I put this guy, at the time of that pilaf machine 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:15.100
 The status of the guy is power 1400 with hit point 1800 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 It became the target of the teaching of Take Tenshi but it did not activate 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.680
 And I wonder if there is no Nenja fires and not a turtle Sen flow or z player Once this guy Possibly 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:37.170
 Aitani has been using this for some time, but I'm still drinking this book 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.840
 The effectiveness of this ability is 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.100
 I'm a target person 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:51.420
 Power 1400 at heat point 1800 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:55.970
 At the start of the department store, the attack ability of hit points and power is 2 part or less of the fellow part guard 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.970
 With 2000 and up not getting fainter 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.350
 It becomes target object 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.700
 Nevertheless 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.700
 Why is this 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.670
 It says that not be the target 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.980
 In the case of one person each other 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.320
 I changed from Vegeta gt to a hero type from this Vegeta- like year . 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.610
 Sometimes e 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:32.610
 Well the damage came in but 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.610
 It was more than 23000 and include the 23000 guy of damage In total 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.250
 It is enough if it exceeds man brother well 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.190
 Well well bosses are so much 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.530
 Because the heat point is not high, if you eat 22,000 to 23,000 from 22,000 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.530
 That's enough 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.670
 Because it was not targeted for elderly people , 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.010
 The ability 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.510
 It will ne guy herb was not be the target of abilities in it at gm 4 bullets 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.100
 Vegeta layer 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.100
 It is Hey your same final impact course of that rare love is 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:20.030
 Well this is a little bit different with this shake but I'm doing this 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.770
 Because that's how it works 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.300
 Right 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:29.920
 It is a similar illustration, but I chose Vega gm of rare 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.849
 I would like to prevent that for a little 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.740
 Can take 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.580
 I wonder if it will come out today 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.780
 9 Hero's a little busy 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:48.680
 It is likely to take No. 2 cop 2 for a while. 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.680
 Stamps available Barber shop Really cut it a bit 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:57.990
 So I did it only on the left side of this discharge result 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:02.100
 Why it is because earlier in the That's princess stand and say what was carried out in only the base of the left there is a high volume 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.840
 Because the volume was huge, the right stand could have been lowered that volume 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:10.260
 Because 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.449
 Because when I take that play video, I always shoot with the one with the larger volume 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.080
 Oh dear 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.700
 Listen to that audience 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:22.110
 Yes to make it easier 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:26.850
 The data of the opening of the Hell Fighter Dodoria I think that none of the open death cause is freeze-death 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:31.680
 The same as hero energy at the end of the round number 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:37.120
 Than us to Do wide That's gym team home to the number of hero Energy 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.270
 It's right here v The power and the guard are sure that the power was out 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.370
 It is there Well part guard 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:48.020
 Furthermore, since it has the power of God Well little Well, it is this good for Zach manner and sill 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:55.490
 Should you not come to the plate together 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:59.420
 The guy is a merciless attack If you attack an enemy with more than 30% damage mitigation 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:04.889
 This is good if damage is 5 times yeah 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:11.509
 This discharge result is such a feeling, but has become long 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.509
 It is such a place this time Kamesenjin Navi model contradictory place
