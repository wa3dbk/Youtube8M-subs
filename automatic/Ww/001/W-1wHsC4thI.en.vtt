new<00:00:13.920> armor<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.730> item<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> first<00:00:15.780> thing

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
new armor is an item so the first thing

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.630 
new armor is an item so the first thing
we<00:00:16.020> want<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> type<00:00:16.740> public<00:00:17.190> static

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
we want to do is type public static

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.099 
we want to do is type public static
final<00:00:19.640> final<00:00:20.640> item<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> name<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.020> our

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
final final item then the name of our

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
final final item then the name of our
items<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.769> we'll<00:00:22.920> call<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.490> helm<00:00:23.939> as

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
items so we'll call this one helm as

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.400 
items so we'll call this one helm as
it's<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> helmet<00:00:26.359> then<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it's going to be the helmet then that is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
it's going to be the helmet then that is
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> equal<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.310> new<00:00:29.810> item<00:00:30.810> armor<00:00:31.430> and<00:00:32.430> then

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
going to equal a new item armor and then

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.319 
going to equal a new item armor and then
put<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.680> brackets<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> there<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:36.000> takes

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
put the brackets in there this takes

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
put the brackets in there this takes
four<00:00:37.020> variables<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.399> being<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
four variables so the first on being the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.530 
four variables so the first on being the
ID<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.989> let's<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> thousand<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> second

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
ID so let's go for a thousand the second

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.080 
ID so let's go for a thousand the second
one<00:00:42.719> being<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:44.420> think<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.280> NM<00:00:47.280> NM<00:00:48.620> armor

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
one being I think the NM NM armor

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
one being I think the NM NM armor
material<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.890> real<00:00:53.719> dots<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.129> then<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.340> find

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
material to real dots and then you find

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
material to real dots and then you find
that<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that what you want it to have the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.110 
that what you want it to have the
strength<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.420> this<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.379> diamond

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
strength of so this will go with diamond

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.910 
strength of so this will go with diamond
then<00:01:03.120> comma<00:01:03.899> space<00:01:04.970> modloader<00:01:07.159> top<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.549> sorry

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
then comma space modloader top me sorry

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
then comma space modloader top me sorry
modloader<00:01:10.920> dots<00:01:11.850> add<00:01:13.189> armor<00:01:14.390> which<00:01:15.390> takes<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
modloader dots add armor which takes a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
modloader dots add armor which takes a
string<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:20.000> we'll<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
string which is going to be we'll just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
string which is going to be we'll just
call<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.450> test<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.860> i'll<00:01:23.100> show<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.369> all

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
call it test for now i'll show you all

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
call it test for now i'll show you all
that<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> second<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> last<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that is in a second then the last one is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
that is in a second then the last one is
going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.460> 0<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> helmet<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.380> if

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
going to be 0 if it's a helmet one if

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.999 
going to be 0 if it's a helmet one if
it's<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.090> its<00:01:30.270> chest<00:01:30.689> too<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.829> its

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's like one if its chest too if its

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.319 
it's like one if its chest too if its
legs<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> three<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.060> um<00:01:35.060> what<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> got

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
legs and three if it's um what I got

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.200 
legs and three if it's um what I got
boots<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> might<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.950> be

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
boots think that's right it might not be

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.120 
boots think that's right it might not be
and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.840> dot<00:01:40.290> set<00:01:41.090> item<00:01:42.090> name

texture files and folders and so if we

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.140 
texture files and folders and so if we
go<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.410> armor<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.460> see<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.880> two

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
go into armor you can see they have two

go into armor you can see they have two
images<00:02:24.450> chain<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> skull<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.520> chain

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
images chain on the skull one and chain

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.580 
images chain on the skull one and chain
on<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> school<00:02:27.180> too<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:28.050> wanted<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> use

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
on the school too so if we wanted to use

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
on the school too so if we wanted to use
these<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.510> type<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:32.280> string<00:02:32.670> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
these we just type in this string to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.210 
these we just type in this string to
chain<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.280> then<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.600> arm<00:02:36.959> item<00:02:37.680> armor<00:02:37.950> class

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
chain and then the arm item armor class

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.190 
chain and then the arm item armor class
automatically<00:02:39.180> gets<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> underscore<00:02:40.050> one

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
automatically gets the underscore one

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.170 
automatically gets the underscore one
and<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.500> score<00:02:40.770> two<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:42.030> in

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and on score two but it has to be in

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.390 
and on score two but it has to be in
this<00:02:42.270> armor<00:02:42.630> folder<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.740> what<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.250> would

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this armor folder so what what we would

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.820 
this armor folder so what what we would
do<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:44.880> ours<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:46.230> copy<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
do to use ours is we would copy and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310 
do to use ours is we would copy and
paste<00:02:47.040> these<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:48.270> edit<00:02:48.630> them<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.080> photoshop

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
paste these and edit them in photoshop

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 
paste these and edit them in photoshop
or<00:02:49.650> something<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.340> change<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.880> name<00:02:51.060> to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
or something then change the name to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.180 
or something then change the name to
test<00:02:51.720> or<00:02:51.989> difficult<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.680> test<00:02:52.980> them

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
test or difficult one and test them

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.940 
test or difficult one and test them
score<00:02:53.550> two<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.570> add<00:02:54.780> them<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> armor

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
score two and then add them to the armor

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.979 
score two and then add them to the armor
file<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> minecraft.jar<00:02:57.300> we<00:02:57.570> want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.959> use

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
file in the minecraft.jar we want to use

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.090 
file in the minecraft.jar we want to use
it<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.810> then<00:03:00.810> would<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.470> test<00:03:01.830> like

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it so then would have it as test like

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
it so then would have it as test like
that<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.940> we're<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.120> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.390> put<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> as

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
that but we're just going to put it as

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
that but we're just going to put it as
chain<00:03:04.140> as<00:03:04.620> an<00:03:04.860> example<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
chain as an example so you can see that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.190 
chain as an example so you can see that
it<00:03:06.000> works<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:08.540> we<00:03:09.540> are<00:03:09.600> going<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.989> do

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
it works and then we are going to do

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.440 
it works and then we are going to do
modloader<00:03:11.209> dots<00:03:12.209> add<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:14.390> name<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:16.700> our<00:03:17.700> helmet

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
modloader dots add a name to our helmet

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.870 
modloader dots add a name to our helmet
and<00:03:18.660> we're<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> call<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.530> whole<00:03:20.489> months

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and we're going to call it whole months

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.140 
and we're going to call it whole months
before<00:03:21.239> now<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.400> about<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.730> that's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
before now and that is about it that's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150 
before now and that is about it that's
how<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.330> add<00:03:27.540> armor<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.170> obviously<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.860> if

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
how you add armor so obviously you if

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.550 
how you add armor so obviously you if
you<00:03:29.459> want<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.820> add<00:03:30.000> say<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.750> chest<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.580> would<00:03:32.760> do

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
you want to add say a chest you would do

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.580 
you want to add say a chest you would do
new<00:03:34.560> item<00:03:34.980> armor<00:03:35.400> called<00:03:35.970> chest<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:37.500> would

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
new item armor called chest you would

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.500 
new item armor called chest you would
change<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.040> ID<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.910> would<00:03:39.000> keep<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
change the ID you would keep this the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.550 
change the ID you would keep this the
same<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.930> wanted<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.350> same

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
strength you keep this the same if you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.750 
strength you keep this the same if you
want<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.110> same<00:03:43.290> texture<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.950> you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
want to have the same texture and you

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.630 
want to have the same texture and you
would<00:03:44.910> set<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.250> then<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.489> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
would set that to one and then do the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.090 
would set that to one and then do the
same<00:03:47.910> for<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.320> obviously<00:03:49.410> if<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.920> want

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100

to add a texture you can follow my items
tutorial<00:03:53.519> if<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.640> want<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.910> know<00:03:54.000> how<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.209> do

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
tutorial if you want to know how to do

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.650 
tutorial if you want to know how to do
that<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> we<00:03:55.769> can<00:03:55.950> make<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:57.209> be<00:03:57.360> called

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
that so we can make this to be called

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.270 
that so we can make this to be called
chest<00:03:58.760> k<00:03:59.760> for<00:04:00.090> example<00:04:00.480> then<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:01.799> save<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
chest k for example then if we save that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.460 
chest k for example then if we save that
and<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:02.910> launched<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:06.030> should<00:04:06.269> get<00:04:06.510> two

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and then launched it we should get two

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.880 
and then launched it we should get two
new<00:04:08.070> items<00:04:09.060> if<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.540> launches<00:04:09.840> any<00:04:10.320> time<00:04:10.590> there

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
new items if it launches any time there

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.500 
new items if it launches any time there
we<00:04:10.950> go

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
we go

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.210 
we go
so<00:04:13.510> if<00:04:13.600> we<00:04:13.690> launch<00:04:13.960> up<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.290> creative<00:04:14.770> mode<00:04:14.950> world

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
so if we launch up a creative mode world

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.830 
so if we launch up a creative mode world
so<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.490> can<00:04:15.640> spawn<00:04:15.880> them<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.820> if<00:04:19.330> we<00:04:19.450> scroll

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
so we can spawn them in and if we scroll

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.260 
so we can spawn them in and if we scroll
down<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:20.140> see<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:21.010> two<00:04:21.430> new<00:04:21.610> items<00:04:22.000> our

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
down we see we have two new items our

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.710 
down we see we have two new items our
chest<00:04:22.690> plate<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:24.060> why<00:04:25.060> they<00:04:25.210> both<00:04:25.420> called

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
chest plate and why they both called

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:37.050 
chest plate and why they both called
chest<00:04:25.960> plate<00:04:31.350> odd<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:35.290> why<00:04:35.530> both<00:04:36.400> our<00:04:36.580> items

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
chest plate odd and why both our items

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.950 
chest plate odd and why both our items
are<00:04:37.150> called<00:04:37.300> just<00:04:37.510> play<00:04:37.660> anyway<00:04:38.500> hopefully

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
are called just play anyway hopefully

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.270 
are called just play anyway hopefully
