the downside to this bag I find is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.959 
the downside to this bag I find is
because<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.410> quite<00:00:40.649> thin<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.460> doesn't<00:00:41.850> have

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
because it's quite thin it doesn't have

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
because it's quite thin it doesn't have
a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> stretch<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.440> can't<00:00:43.770> really

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.360 
a lot of stretch and I can't really
carry<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.820> than<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.660> usual<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.370> so
