00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I think easily actually he's already hit

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.470 
I think easily actually he's already hit
Nana<00:00:07.319> four<00:00:08.280> times<00:00:08.550> five<00:00:08.790> times<00:00:08.849> she's<00:00:09.330> at

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
Nana four times five times she's at

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.879 
Nana four times five times she's at
probably<00:00:09.719> about<00:00:09.839> fifty<00:00:10.200> percent<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.709> a<00:00:10.740> high

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
probably about fifty percent at a high

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.709 
probably about fifty percent at a high
percent<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.849> know<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.120> he<00:00:12.360> could<00:00:12.540> just

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
percent and you know what he could just

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.029 
percent and you know what he could just
need<00:00:12.870> her<00:00:12.959> there<00:00:13.169> and<00:00:13.349> she<00:00:13.469> probably<00:00:13.679> died

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
need her there and she probably died

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.520 
need her there and she probably died
yeah<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.730> think<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.209> just<00:00:15.450> uh<00:00:15.629> checking

them

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.670 
them
because<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.420> sticking<00:02:49.140> hacks<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
because it's just sticking hacks in the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.070 
because it's just sticking hacks in the
animation<00:02:50.010> longer<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.210> head<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.510> yeah

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
animation longer in the head like yeah

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.580 
animation longer in the head like yeah
exactly<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.020> go<00:02:55.110> high<00:02:55.260> I
