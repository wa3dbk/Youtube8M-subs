and<00:01:21.540> external<00:01:22.470> sd<00:01:22.710> card<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and external sd card so here we go so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.160 
and external sd card so here we go so
let's<00:01:26.040> say<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.850> installed<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.900> Dark

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
let's say if we have installed the Dark

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890 
let's say if we have installed the Dark
Knight<00:01:28.439> Rises<00:01:28.500> game<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.340> our<00:01:29.700> SD<00:01:30.060> card<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> we

Knight Rises game on our SD card and we

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
Knight Rises game on our SD card and we

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
internal memory because we wouldn't able

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.330

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
download folder or else you can create a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.809 
download folder or else you can create a
new<00:02:10.440> folder<00:02:12.260> move<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
new folder move it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.600 
new folder move it
now<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.060> will<00:02:15.269> take<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:16.110> time<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:17.250> move<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
now it will take it's time to move the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.970 
now it will take it's time to move the
file<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.390> external<00:02:18.900> SD<00:02:19.140> card<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.500> course
