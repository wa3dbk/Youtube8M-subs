00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.210
 the Dutch hockey women have their third game on the rabo and through it 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.639
 circus trophy with the 0 0 draw against new zealand 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.109
 orange that due to the victory of australia over germany was already certain of a place 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.989
 in the winners group, a fairly weak game played against the kiwis 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.259
 We asked to be active for English why it didn't work out for new 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.350
 Zeeland and yes I think there 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 Quite a lot of reasons to think of two lanes being 50 but I think so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.090
 He just had to look at everything himself and that today we will not have the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.490
 played a match and that is a great pity 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.590
 and these va are at the moment that it is not good that you have such a competition 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.540
 put down 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.690
 played countless meters but are sure of the winners pool 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.440
 no absolutely not having exactly that precedes us but not 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 and that it is all the more important to win today with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.970
 3 points lower 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.780
 offenders must go 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 it's his oath was an absolute no i enjoy no underestimate or anything 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.690
 such 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.880
 yet orange did not appear sharp 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.340
 little succeeded in the team for mac skopas and at times the game even looks 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.100
 storage 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.830
 yes you may miss some energy and time but also the feeling that there is not enough 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.189
 just deliver energy 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.109
 but this is indeed how it might look like deferred payment 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.079
 Everyone worked out correctly just that it just doesn't work out every and then it becomes 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.829
 very heavy and my feeling was that we might even go into details 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:17.870
 serve some basis 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.230
 yes I can not lie and then it becomes very heavy 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.770
 And yes, this is indeed twice as heavy for a lot of energy 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 tuck in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.690
 if you are there if you then look a little ahead so that winner pool what 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.680
 should you go there 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.340
 what should actually happen then 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.500
 well i think the regular team have to make more progress, we are very sorry 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.770
 proud of ourselves and keep doing it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.439
 this year its just gotta step eterna after today a big step and i got there 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.370
 all confidence in the city we just keep going together 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.679
 Englishmen played her second game during this chip discussed 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.469
 bean sombroek tipped the second group match coaches buyers choose 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.520
 to use his two closing points alternately 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.490
 how is that for english it is wonderful to play at home and enjoy there 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.560
 I am very owner 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 twice my own club in own stadium take yes that would be super and out 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.189
 heeswijk has of maxim the round rose and the profitability guts it is certain 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.430
 don't go a moment don't try impartial so well 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.790
 shave for team 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.240
 typical rhythm is needed there that you hear that sometimes it is 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.039
 mh year in itself, however, it is to keep playing all games of chance 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.569
 a match in the week it is quite used to play and we train 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.300
 so in between 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.959
 taking sharp will hold 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.379
 Thursday the orange tournament continues in the winners pool 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.249
 with the match against argentina
