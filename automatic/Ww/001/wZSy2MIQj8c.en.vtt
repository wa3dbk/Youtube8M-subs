00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
can't tell between the two of them which

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.930 
can't tell between the two of them which
one's<00:06:38.420> got<00:06:38.630> more<00:06:38.780> heat<00:06:38.990> but<00:06:39.520> maybe<00:06:40.520> the<00:06:40.790> non

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
one's got more heat but maybe the non

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.320 
one's got more heat but maybe the non
Nando's<00:06:41.570> just<00:06:42.110> a<00:06:42.170> little<00:06:42.560> bit<00:06:43.090> maybe<00:06:44.090> because

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
Nando's just a little bit maybe because

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.960 
Nando's just a little bit maybe because
where<00:06:44.480> it's<00:06:44.600> thicker<00:06:48.580> so<00:06:49.580> this<00:06:49.790> one's

where it's thicker so this one's

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.430
