it's<00:06:00.660> definitely<00:06:01.139> another<00:06:01.320> way<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.699> increase

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
it's definitely another way to increase

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.339 
it's definitely another way to increase
your<00:06:02.820> kill<00:06:03.210> death<00:06:03.389> ratio<00:06:03.479> because<00:06:04.020> you'll<00:06:04.169> die

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
your kill death ratio because you'll die

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:05.540 
your kill death ratio because you'll die
a<00:06:04.380> lot<00:06:04.620> of<00:06:04.740> times<00:06:04.889> doing<00:06:05.070> it<00:06:05.250> I'm<00:06:05.370> not<00:06:05.400> trying
