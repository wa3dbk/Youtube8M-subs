only speculate for the moment one reason

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.870 
only speculate for the moment one reason
may<00:01:20.770> have<00:01:20.920> been<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.130> weakening<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
may have been the weakening of the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.640 
may have been the weakening of the
dollar<00:01:22.150> which<00:01:22.689> is<00:01:22.840> going<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.140> make<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.380> very

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
dollar which is going to make it very

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.039

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
States a second more likely reason is

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.620
