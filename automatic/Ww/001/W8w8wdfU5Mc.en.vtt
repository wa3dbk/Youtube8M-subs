00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
clever here and make myself some food

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.940 
clever here and make myself some food
but<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:31.960> didn't<00:06:32.200> actually<00:06:32.290> have<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.560> materials

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
but I didn't actually have the materials

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.380 
but I didn't actually have the materials
to<00:06:33.040> make<00:06:33.070> a<00:06:33.220> sack<00:06:33.460> of<00:06:33.490> flour<00:06:33.760> to<00:06:34.060> then<00:06:34.180> make<00:06:34.360> a

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
to make a sack of flour to then make a

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.480 
to make a sack of flour to then make a
loaf<00:06:34.630> of<00:06:34.780> bread

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
loaf of bread
