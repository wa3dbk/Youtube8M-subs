I'm simply going to put my SD card into
the<00:01:07.200> tray<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:08.689> if<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.840> notice<00:01:10.909> this<00:01:11.909> blue

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the tray and if you notice this blue

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.910 
the tray and if you notice this blue
life<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:14.780> only<00:01:15.780> gives<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.409> option<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
life one only gives you an option of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.260 
life one only gives you an option of
using<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> dual<00:01:20.420> SIM<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.490> tray<00:01:23.880> only

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
using it's a dual SIM but this tray only

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.499 
using it's a dual SIM but this tray only
allows<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> put<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.530> SD<00:01:26.130> card<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
allows you to put in an SD card or a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
allows you to put in an SD card or a
nano<00:01:28.140> SIM<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.860> both

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
nano SIM but not both

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.630 
nano SIM but not both
so<00:01:30.259> for<00:01:31.259> most<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.040> won't<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.400> able<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so for most people you won't be able to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.679 
so for most people you won't be able to
use<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.479> dual<00:01:33.900> SIM<00:01:35.240> functionality<00:01:36.240> simply

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
use the dual SIM functionality simply

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
use the dual SIM functionality simply
because<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> only<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:39.110> slot<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.560> put

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
because there is only one slot to put

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
because there is only one slot to put
two<00:01:41.159> things<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.320> says<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
two things in and that actually says it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
two things in and that actually says it
in<00:01:43.799> instructions<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.259> SD

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
in instructions so now that I have my SD

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.620 
in instructions so now that I have my SD
card<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> tray<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.170> am<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> insert<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
card in the tray I am going to insert it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.170 
card in the tray I am going to insert it
into<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:53.130> tray<00:01:53.460> here

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.700 

and<00:01:56.770> simply<00:01:57.770> gently<00:01:58.460> push<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.820> in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.910 

you<00:02:06.310> do<00:02:06.729> have<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.979> pretty<00:02:08.979> careful<00:02:09.369> here<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you do have to be pretty careful here so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
you do have to be pretty careful here so
I'm<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:13.500> push<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.740> like<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
I'm going to push it in like that and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.520 
I'm going to push it in like that and
there<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.930> go<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.590> how<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.920> install<00:02:18.340> the

there you go that's how you install the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.220 
there you go that's how you install the
micro<00:02:20.530> SD<00:02:20.920> memory<00:02:21.100> card<00:02:21.580> into<00:02:21.850> your<00:02:22.420> life<00:02:22.930> one
