00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 men and it behaves as a recessive gene in women 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.650
 but baldness is an Inca tucson heritage we will find the 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.990
 genes for baldness in our calculations are the other chromosomes 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.990
 which we study later 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.490
 now I do not know how I'm doing gymnastics for a calm person and not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.150
 fault 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 carlos queiroz some 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.289
 to read it author only the monkey 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 besides her and the lover in the woman he resists 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.070
 then we're going to go out and put a five who's bald who has baldness 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.760
 will have a center with 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.790
 genotype like that to lego 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.320
 who is not bald will want to be 2 is not the case 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.820
 so we have there 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.370
 one man presented the genotypes cerro-uru simone 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 bald without the sting the woman also ended up we have two neighbors and relatives 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.740
 we call this how zico hours and genetics gimenes 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.490
 and which 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.090
 but when I have one with c2 we're going to have the man 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 bald and there are women 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.980
 fault 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.400
 I realize now I have the sea is terrible the necklines 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 and there is that he came to 5 a man that she is dominant in the field says he 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.620
 remain local 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.549
 while the woman is already 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.549
 normal does not include covers 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 if at 2 c 2 min 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.310
 bald perceive the two Germans there they are and which or backpacks 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.080
 In this case, my wife is also 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.320
 Calcutta 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 presents 2 genish 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750
 on note the peace museum 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.320
 so do not forget 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 I have the inheritance of the sexual chromosomes. 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.680
 the money is located on chromosomes xix 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.060
 who is not inheritance of ilp tricolorzinho the inheritance the rich land 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.310
 we'll meet the genes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.510
 on chromosome 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.479
 and pressure 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.429
 this year the heritages author naps among them his site the baldness that alia 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:19.389
 despite being an immense autosomal, we also present 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.380
 find there 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.480
 a colitis reference 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 of the sexual part in the immense so here the baldness of the man she is much more 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 than women 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.219
 this matter is important but you have to delve into why there are 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.759
 many details that we need to be studying from you goes deeper 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.909
 I hope you have understood to go a little bit about the chromosomes 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.389
 and I'm waiting for you for our next biology class 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:51.789
 folks
