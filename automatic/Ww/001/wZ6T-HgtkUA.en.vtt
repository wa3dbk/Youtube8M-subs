00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello everyone and rajoy good 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.620
 always with android and I will teach how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.569
 change the boot animation 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.000
 the start image of the device as 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.790
 we have the phone and I'm going to put a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 that taken from the internet from another video that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 it's from the marvel 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 The truth is that the video tells us 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.369
 that we will be on a route I have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.340
 looked over and that route seems to me 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 that is not valid so let's go 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 first we need an application like 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.439
 in my case that the root browser 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.439
 we are going to go to system 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
 and within exist mean here we have 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.040
 a file called boot animation 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.470
 points and this is currently the one 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.530
 has the current image on that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.210
 is the halo shaft logo above 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.350
 should say rename 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.350
 and put at the end 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.340
 a line and I'm going to put something to do 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.460
 so that I know it is a copy of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.460
 security 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.769
 you have jon and to put of cape you can 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.650
 put anything that we by 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.940
 old or old example what more for 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.850
 that you know is a copy of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.330
 security of the wood animation then in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.050
 Audio 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 in wii we have to look for power on and 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.120
 power on and it's a sound that's the one 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.940
 when it turns on it does as a wing a 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.380
 small sound when the shaft logo 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.920
 let's change for one that comes with it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 with this marvel animation boat so 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.570
 I 'm going to rename this one too 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.560
 to rename to also backup 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.560
 or cape 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.510
 and a low 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 I escaped ok 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 I will now be simply named 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 choose the files that I have in 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.610
 downloads because I sent them to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.010
 mail and what is 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.070
 and I downloaded them 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 download and the files I'll put in the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.440
 description of the video as you see the button 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.970
 animation 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.990
 I copied 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.990
 let's go back 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.390
 here they attend 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.850
 and a half 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.550
 we paste it here and they will appear in the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.750
 Backup and again this would 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.600
 the new 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 now we go to the tickets again to the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.290
 sd card 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.189
 explain the charges 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.710
 power here may 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.180
 we copy back 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:50.510
 there are half 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.939
 audio wee and we paste here 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.930
 now in principle it should work 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.150
 how is it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.250
 I will restart to approve and if not 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.260
 would work would be to put the permissions not 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.540
 I know if you appreciate that they put the permits 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.540
 put in this place the power on 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 as you can see the power on new has 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.819
 permits read and write 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.640
 execution for the administrator to 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.290
 we have the permissions are have the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.849
 second part of permits the second 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.189
 group has as read and write 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.340
 while others only have 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.810
 reading and have no other reading for the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.060
 third group so you can change the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.480
 permissions to save me problems 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.790
 permits means that for the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.120
 owner that has everyone and for the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.190
 group yes for others that can be read like that 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.170
 we give change and we have the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.980
 permissions just like the original we are going to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.409
 do the same in the boot animation 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.230
 is going to change permissions would be to remove 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.940
 the writing for groups and for others 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.549
 is going to put reading I will mark as 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 ok we already have the two permits and now 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.380
 I'm going to try restarting 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.200
 I'm going to an application 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.560
 the flash and if so let me start 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 normal 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.690
 debut to have to give the button 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.690
 down to make you see how it is 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.800
 well, it seems that yes, there was 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.439
 change it in the other site as well as 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.990
 you see we have the video of marvel the 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.460
 full game and with music 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.560
