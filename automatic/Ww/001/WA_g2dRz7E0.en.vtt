00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.759
 actually I'd meant to video 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 platform yes like sleek with a 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.660
 montage of various deaths begin 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.460
 but I already have that with mine 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.650
 very first test video for gamestar 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.619
 that was the pc shooter back then 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 insurgency and da franz nobody great 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.880
 had stolen from florian heider 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 they said at the time 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.970
 dark souls have said they and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.500
 Yes that's true 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.300
 The haider has me now 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 forgave but I had to give him 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 promise never to do that again 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 in the absence of a creative 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.790
 That's why I simply say alternative 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 Following the platform is so hard 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 is not a miracle 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 finally make from behind wood 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 and yes there are many parallel to the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.480
 playing salt but still dares 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.480
 platform some exciting new things 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370
 equal blood 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.760
 yes you are in the right place indiana 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.580
 you have to practice blood treatments 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.230
 only their secret will reveal themselves 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 platform with a classic plot 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 introduction highlight and so on 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.690
 promises will quickly become one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.370
 better instructed in best souls 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.900
 Tradition is here at best the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.300
 initial situation reasonably clear 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 Outlined we come in the skin of ours 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.140
 figurine in the victorian 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 big city jana looking for one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 remedies we need because of us 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.009
 a mysterious disease slowly 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.900
 doth goof that only jana of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.610
 this same pest was attacked 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 the inhabitants are either dead or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.369
 mutates and for us begins one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.369
 hell trip 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.280
 after us the first opponent 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.680
 inevitably from tomorrow when we as 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.479
 armed ajka reborn and must 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.240
 from now on indiana clean up 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.710
 so much to the initial situation the rest of the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
 story we pure old 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
 Descriptions sparse dialoge and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.410
 details in the game world together 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.900
 platform does not take us there 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.180
 hand and that's good as well 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.560
 Carefully explore Jana's that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.479
 reveal and interpret the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 backgrounds is just as much fun as they are 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.350
 in dark souls and also the setting 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.670
 points in that it so unused 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.620
 and great design 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.209
 It is a pity that we do not 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.640
 so much time have the pretty scenery 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 look for lurking in blood born 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.989
 behind every corner of the dead 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 the game breathes the spirit of dark souls 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.120
 and demon souls extends that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.959
 playful but through some exciting 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.150
 innovations 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.830
 before we come to those again 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.930
 short overview of the basic 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.909
 for all those who have not played so far 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.709
 have contact points with the series 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.930
 blood bowl gives us as good as possible 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.909
 nothing we start with our hunter 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.110
 indiana without a clue what we as 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.150
 to do next 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.190
 We choose in advance in the character 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.879
 Building Kit only our appearance and ours 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.950
 ancestry 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.569
 the latter decides with which 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.819
 state we will go into the race 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.980
 For example, much strength helps our 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.780
 punch with thick weapons and the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.299
 do we need after the start 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.519
 explore like checkout cash register around alley and 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.340
 remember everything here and fast 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.349
 everyone does not kill the helpful npcs the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 tell us what's wrong with the pest 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.549
 she's gone crazy instead 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.769
 People with mist forks are torching and 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.129
 made us see as a threat and 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.510
 would like to spit on the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.120
 Fights are running for a roleplaying game 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
 very action-heavy, we've beat and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.560
 could beat anyone in real time 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.790
 enemy with skill city ​​with attributes 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.250
 even if the course still 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.500
 not unimportant are we in janam 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.480
 survive which paths how to go 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.859
 what we want to take from the story 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.260
 All that remains for us as a player 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.260
 leave so far so dark souls 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.360
 that does not mean that dark souls 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 veterans so nothing to me nothing you by sheet 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.709
 Bond can walk through 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.780
 Oje on the contrary are the enemies 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.850
 aggressive numerous and the rescuing 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
 checkpoints farther apart 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.600
 and we can not block anymore 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.790
 instead we have to beat nimble 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.680
 dodge the right moment counter 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.360
 and pay close attention to it 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.430
 We do not run out of steam 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.299
 this change ensures that yourself 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.890
 dark souls veterans need to rethink 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.060
 but also aside from it is sheet of 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.730
 The stones play in things 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.380
 difficulty in nothing after each 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.940
 boss opponent waits with his own 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.640
 attack pattern to which we heart 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.050
 have to learn and somehow counter and 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.390
 even normal enemies make us 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.010
 permanent problems because a careless 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.010
 moment can mean death 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.740
 Luckily, every weapon now has two 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.180
 different shapes from the walking stick 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.340
 we can whip at the touch of a button 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.600
 make our sail settle for it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.970
 fold out comfortably 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.800
 Although the campaigns are born in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.759
 not enough on a badger 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.650
 wood 1 zoom 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.320
 that's what the challes dungeons are all about 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.000
 randomized areas in which can 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.830
 we also depending on need with friends 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.449
 the hunt for booty experience and always 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.639
 go deeper bosses opponents 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:07.150
 a nice addition in any case 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.770
 Motivated in the sum offers platform 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.260
 play a more dynamic mechanical game 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.510
 fighting system that demands even veterans 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.979
 this is what the usual thrilling hunting is all about 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.260
 After experience and better equipment 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.440
 even though both are comparatively rare 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.000
 sown is verdi souls games and so 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.400
 the spiritual predecessors of blood bonn 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.500
 has played immediately recognizes the huge 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.750
 jump the leaf born in things optics 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.669
 makes the textures are sharper the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.530
 Lighting effects better the models 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.810
 more detailed and also thanks to the 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.419
 Outstanding designs looks platform 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.400
 just great from what the test time 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.560
 are negatively negative 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.570
 regular breaks in the image rate and 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.940
 the annoyingly long loading times 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.550
 even trained players will often die 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.289
 Wait 40 seconds after every toth 40 seconds 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.479
 they just do not have to 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.130
 but sony has promised improvement here 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.130
 and that means patches 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.330
 blood born is simply outstanding 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.130
 good game that puts us in his gloomy 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.020
 world pulls and never lets go 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.760
 at least if one is extremely thick 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.310
 own skin when it comes to frustration and 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.750
 but sticking hard fights goes for it 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.480
 are the games of from software yes 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.300
 known and that's good too 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.460
 10 deadly attempts are followed by a victory of 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.660
 as great and intense as we are 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.520
 rarely experienced 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.840
 the decision on the strengths of 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.660
 souls play with minor changes 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.900
 Building the gameplay was definite 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.900
 the right
