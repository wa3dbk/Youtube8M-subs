00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
right on their own DX so we can select

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.070 
right on their own DX so we can select
an<00:01:06.170> effect

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.780 

once<00:01:09.710> we<00:01:09.800> have<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.040> with<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.250> effect<00:01:10.490> we<00:01:10.610> want

once we have you with the effect we want
to<00:01:10.880> use

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
to use

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.950 
to use

we<00:01:15.500> assigned<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.220> channel<00:01:16.580> using<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.970> f

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
we assigned to the channel using the f

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
we assigned to the channel using the f
x1<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.479> FX<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.840> assign<00:01:18.170> buttons<00:01:19.240> punch<00:01:20.240> it

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
so you can assign any effect enter into

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.850 
so you can assign any effect enter into
any<00:01:28.650> channel<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.280> both<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.180> so

1 and 2 and the way we differentiate

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.150 
1 and 2 and the way we differentiate
between<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> decks<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:40.200> deck<00:01:40.380> uses<00:01:40.830> red

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
between the decks is one deck uses red

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.390 
between the decks is one deck uses red
LEDs<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.560> that's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> red<00:01:43.890> deck<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
LEDs and that's the red deck in the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.150 
LEDs and that's the red deck in the
software<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:46.410> then<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.620> click<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.950> layer

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
software and then we click the layer

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.060 
software and then we click the layer
button<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.700> takes<00:01:47.820> us<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.150> our<00:01:48.180> second<00:01:48.720> deck

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
button that takes us to our second deck

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
button that takes us to our second deck
where<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> LEDs<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.030> green<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.960> that's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
where the LEDs then go green and that's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560 
where the LEDs then go green and that's
the<00:01:52.320> green<00:01:52.620> depth<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.550> software<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.450> we

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the green depth in the software so we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140 
the green depth in the software so we
can<00:01:54.690> switch<00:01:54.870> between<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:56.340> could<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.820> on

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
can switch between we could do this on

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.550 
can switch between we could do this on
both<00:01:57.210> sides

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560

in the next section the person we can
look<00:02:02.360> as<00:02:02.479> we<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> loop<00:02:02.990> function<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.530> Texas

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.950 
look as we have a loop function in Texas
when<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.130> punch<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.520> an<00:02:06.610> auto<00:02:06.759> loop<00:02:07.090> and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
when we can punch in an auto loop and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.960 
when we can punch in an auto loop and
Altos<00:02:08.410> how<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.739> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.030 

we<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> Luke<00:02:13.840> Rohl<00:02:14.080> function<00:02:14.590> which

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
we have a Luke Rohl function which

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.750 
we have a Luke Rohl function which
allows<00:02:15.190> us<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.640> loop

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
allows us to loop

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.890 
allows us to loop
it's<00:02:18.239> waste

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 

when<00:02:22.409> we<00:02:22.530> released<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.010> audio<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:23.489> go<00:02:23.579> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
when we released the audio will go to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.890 
when we released the audio will go to
the<00:02:23.790> point<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> truck<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.720> would

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the point in the truck where it would

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.390 
the point in the truck where it would
have<00:02:25.019> been<00:02:25.110> had<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.439> not<00:02:25.590> entered<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> loop

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
have been had we not entered the loop

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
have been had we not entered the loop
we<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.090> also<00:02:28.209> punch<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.689> and<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:28.900> manually

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.660 

and<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.020> we're<00:02:32.110> not<00:02:32.200> happy<00:02:32.349> with<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.680> loo<00:02:32.830> we

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and if we're not happy with the loo we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.339 
and if we're not happy with the loo we
can<00:02:33.790> adjust<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> loop<00:02:34.330> voice<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.290> select

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
can adjust the loop voice so if I select

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.370 
can adjust the loop voice so if I select
the<00:02:35.680> output<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:37.150> loop<00:02:37.300> stop<00:02:37.510> scrolling<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.140> I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
the output the loop stop scrolling and I

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.059 
the output the loop stop scrolling and I
can<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:38.709> my<00:02:38.739> job<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:40.120> trim<00:02:40.390> my<00:02:40.420> Luke<00:02:40.720> would<00:02:41.069> do

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
can use my job to trim my Luke would do

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.690 
can use my job to trim my Luke would do
the<00:02:42.220> same<00:02:42.250> with<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> loop<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.150> point

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.430 

so<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.480> trim<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> loop<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.200> make<00:02:50.319> it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
so we can trim the loop up to make it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.199 
so we can trim the loop up to make it
right<00:02:52.140> we<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.319> on<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:54.010> vision<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.459> software

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
right we have on this vision of software

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.000 
right we have on this vision of software
for<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.390> first<00:02:55.599> time<00:02:55.750> ever<00:02:55.989> each<00:02:56.739> have

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
for the first time ever each have

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.190 
for the first time ever each have
incorporated<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.819> pretty<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.080> can

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
incorporated be pretty so we can

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.229 
incorporated be pretty so we can
synchronize<00:02:59.739> all<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.430> our<00:03:00.550> audio<00:03:00.849> together

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
synchronize all of our audio together

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.180 
synchronize all of our audio together
and<00:03:01.540> temper<00:03:02.050> locket<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.530> beat<00:03:02.860> locket

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and temper locket and beat locket

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.089 
and temper locket and beat locket
together<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:05.050> run<00:03:05.290> seamless<00:03:05.860> loops

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
together so we can run seamless loops

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.009 
together so we can run seamless loops
across<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:07.000> four<00:03:07.239> tracks<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.690> using<00:03:07.900> all

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
across all four tracks and using all

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.120 
across all four tracks and using all
four<00:03:08.170> tracks<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.650> painlessly

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
four tracks and painlessly

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.770 
four tracks and painlessly
we<00:03:10.670> have<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> standard<00:03:11.090> functionality<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.750> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
we have a standard functionality in the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.450 
we have a standard functionality in the
deck<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.260> Lake<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.540> set<00:03:14.780> Q<00:03:14.960> point

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
deck of Lake you so we can set Q point

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.840 
deck of Lake you so we can set Q point
test<00:03:16.460> from<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> Q<00:03:16.910> point<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:18.410> play

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
test from the Q point and then play

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.300 
test from the Q point and then play
we've<00:03:20.360> also<00:03:20.540> got<00:03:20.780> hot<00:03:20.960> key<00:03:21.140> points<00:03:21.440> which<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
we've also got hot key points which I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.750 
we've also got hot key points which I
can<00:03:22.520> set

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.250 

so<00:03:27.209> there's<00:03:27.390> four<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.720> those<00:03:27.840> when<00:03:28.140> they're

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
so there's four of those when they're

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.760 
so there's four of those when they're
active<00:03:28.530> they<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.799> green<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.159> can<00:03:29.310> punch<00:03:29.489> back

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.580 

to<00:03:33.280> any<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.670> those<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.600> then<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.930> simply

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
to any one of those and then we simply

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.960 
to any one of those and then we simply
clear<00:03:35.830> them<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.190> use<00:03:36.310> them<00:03:36.490> again<00:03:36.670> later<00:03:36.850> on

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
clear them and use them again later on

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.360 
clear them and use them again later on
in<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> track

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
in the track
