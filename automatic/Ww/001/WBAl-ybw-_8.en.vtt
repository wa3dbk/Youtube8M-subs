00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.099
 in this ineffectiveness of the pontoon curro playful programming we have a new 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.689
 program which was suggested by a Colombian I think few that what 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 I wanted to take pictures with a rubik run 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 with rubik cubes upl end then peace you have to buy many cube rubik 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.510
 to make a photo not to share with their colors and aromas to accommodate them is a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 ungrateful and absolutely ridiculous work but there is no lack who wants to do but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.500
 you did it if you prioritize the accountant for Argentina not as hard as 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 terrorist acts of eta in spite of the get them up easy not the other one that is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.320
 that this one I put more options and good to the twelve images and few votes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 robert low 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 we have here the program with a nice one and with what is a rubik cube like 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 you can observe 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 end then here we have florid dignity 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.239
 and of course 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.230
 You'll see that your interest is very similar to that of Marc 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.940
 it is not a coincidence that to do is that deep down they gave it to them I want to want alhama not 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.410
 of course good then let's make the great picture also not 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.730
 they were hurt in agreement but by then we have it here and I do not know if 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.030
 well this type of links that we want is that we have images 1 and x 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.190
 based on the clients, the mehr agency will be present in the manual 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.280
 glasses a day the second team of the nineteenth century in corporations 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 and now I'm going to say the size of the vision of the grid that I need 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 there in ecycling and elevating well if instead of 10 by harassing you 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.850
 5 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 for four very small valencia I made a big picture 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.640
 end and the final size pablo berger of 10 by 10 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.400
 to anticipate 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.350
 mckibben good then since we have the data put 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 the zetas 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.760
 let's give it 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 a second name shibo 1 to save 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 for example in the program this wonderful performance bursts of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.050
 wind 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.969
 French Navy fountains 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.739
 little let's tell him now 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.099
 Ireland 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.769
 the deployment 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.869
 this is all in the manual is going to be selected 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.809
 the type of images that we want you to be attentive 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:33.119
 the and in fact is that it is the one that we decided that we are going to use that is the one of ribéry 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.779
 eric images that I have 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:35.950
 I will not tell you 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.439
 create the mosaic I completed the system this 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.139
 our selective the selection 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.679
 world 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.809
 nadal we request the senate approved in general 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.980

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.980
 the midfielder granota in colon 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.679
 it is noted courtesy of bathroom 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:07.469
 font daley january is conceivably accepted that the Libyans who should go together 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.509
 but the circles of 2007 and managed that the aristocrat because the pp to see to see 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.299
 from here we have the image 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.510
 and we can 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.800
 it's slow and very well the process is ours was the real high goalie 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.249
 to make him believe this is not 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.169
 when he ni 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.869
 ricky wonder ergo patras 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:32.509
 - with each other or that you get here that is the image that will happen to you as jpg 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.729
 one of the details that has to be nice is that by this act of 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.729
 pressure and more fair ocampo first goals than to circulate Palestinian state and 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:45.419
 sixty squares like rubik's cube are circles or formatted with the drawing 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.359
 of your foot like this with all you want 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.119
 you feel a program that is included in the yaqui in the package for 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.899
 process these images inspire your own collection upn yeah let me 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.939
 put you off at times and the screen the directory 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.159
 the letter G 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.749
 josé malavé in the help 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.549
 the original images 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.659
 are I do not know if I'll get there 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.760
 gil those are the photos burn by a little bigger 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.089
 the technician wants to do 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.599
 this 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.629
 with rubik's cube 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.659
 although it is a bit the intention of this program to do the same 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.430
 instead of looking for something that costs to earn they do it 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 you do it through the samur 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.550
 cheaper cheaper by 12 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.360
 not the central one 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.960
 and it's free available only only imaz a dot com 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.069
 and companies 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.530
 of those lists
