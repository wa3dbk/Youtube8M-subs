out<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.630> bottom<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.770> keeping<00:01:32.100> your

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
out back on the bottom so keeping your

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.300 
out back on the bottom so keeping your
hips<00:01:32.399> level<00:01:33.210> start<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.289> a<00:01:34.320> feet<00:01:35.039> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
hips level start with a feet just

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.279 
hips level start with a feet just
outside<00:01:35.460> shoulder-width<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.899> toe<00:01:37.110> out

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
outside shoulder-width you can toe out

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.139 
outside shoulder-width you can toe out
just<00:01:37.590> slightly<00:01:37.679> this<00:01:38.399> is<00:01:38.580> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.060> an

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
just slightly this is going to be an

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.540 
just slightly this is going to be an
example<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.750> higher<00:01:39.990> power<00:01:40.289> back<00:01:40.649> squat<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
example of a higher power back squat so

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.600 
example of a higher power back squat so
he's<00:01:42.539> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.140> underneath<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.979> unrack

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
he's going to go underneath and unrack

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
he's going to go underneath and unrack
the<00:01:44.819> bar<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> grip<00:01:46.110> that's<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:47.099> close

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the bar with a grip that's as as close

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.080 
the bar with a grip that's as as close
as<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.170> comfortable<00:01:49.709> so<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> idea<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.880> want

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
as is comfortable so the idea is we want

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
as is comfortable so the idea is we want
to<00:01:51.209> recruit<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.050> muscles<00:01:52.440> through<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.649> upper

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to recruit the muscles through the upper

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.309 
to recruit the muscles through the upper
back<00:01:53.099> to<00:01:53.880> squeeze<00:01:54.660> squeeze<00:01:55.500> together<00:01:56.069> and

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
back to squeeze squeeze together and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.109 
back to squeeze squeeze together and
produce<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.560> nice<00:01:58.740> platform<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.459> bar<00:01:59.670> so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
produce a nice platform for the bar so

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
produce a nice platform for the bar so
again<00:02:00.539> hips<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.050> bucket<00:02:01.349> of<00:02:01.440> water<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.130> want

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
again hips are a bucket of water we want

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.070 
again hips are a bucket of water we want
to<00:02:02.429> try<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:02.580> sit<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> hips<00:02:03.149> directly<00:02:03.420> below

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
to try and sit the hips directly below

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.580 
to try and sit the hips directly below
into<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.160> into<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.459> deep<00:02:05.700> spot<00:02:05.940> position<00:02:06.590> go

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
into the into that deep spot position go

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
into the into that deep spot position go
ahead<00:02:07.770> squat

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
ahead squat

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.280

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:22.690 

you<00:03:08.640> go

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:36.710 

hey<00:03:25.310> hey

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.020 

two<00:03:37.590> things<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.980> will<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.430> concerned<00:03:38.820> with

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
two things that will be concerned with

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.090 
two things that will be concerned with
here<00:03:39.390> are<00:03:39.690> ankle<00:03:40.620> mobility<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:43.100> back

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
here are ankle mobility and back

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.490 
here are ankle mobility and back
flexibility<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.330> if<00:03:45.450> you're<00:03:45.570> rounding<00:03:45.840> your

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
flexibility so if you're rounding your

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.460 
flexibility so if you're rounding your
posture<00:03:47.010> as<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.640> swap<00:03:48.110> pay<00:03:49.110> off<00:03:49.230> legs

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
posture as you swap pay off legs

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.440 
posture as you swap pay off legs
rounding<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> posture<00:03:50.460> here<00:03:50.700> obviously

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
rounding the posture here obviously

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.300 
rounding the posture here obviously
that's<00:03:51.960> evidence<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.440> either<00:03:52.620> lack<00:03:53.040> of

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
that's evidence of either lack of

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.370 
that's evidence of either lack of
functionality<00:03:54.270> through<00:03:54.570> lack<00:03:55.230> of

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
functionality through lack of

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.190 
functionality through lack of
flexibility<00:03:55.920> or<00:03:56.100> lacks<00:03:56.280> right<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.660> really

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
flexibility or lacks right so we really

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.710 
flexibility or lacks right so we really
want<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.560> emphasize<00:03:58.940> pulling<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.060> chest<00:04:00.450> on

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
want to emphasize pulling that chest on

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.010 
want to emphasize pulling that chest on
one<00:04:01.530> good<00:04:01.740> exercise<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.280> can<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:03.210> get<00:04:03.840> that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
one good exercise you can do to get that

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.770 
one good exercise you can do to get that
athlete<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:05.070> start<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.850> scratch<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.300> back<00:04:06.480> and

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
athlete to start to scratch the back and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.720 
athlete to start to scratch the back and
stretch<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.110> hip<00:04:07.260> flexors<00:04:07.680> put<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.370> elbows

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
stretch the hip flexors put the elbows

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.060 
stretch the hip flexors put the elbows
in<00:04:08.970> between<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.540> knees<00:04:09.720> bring<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.740> hands

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
in between the knees bring the hands

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.720 
in between the knees bring the hands
together<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.730> then<00:04:12.830> obviously<00:04:13.830> Rob<00:04:14.310> has<00:04:14.550> good

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
together and then obviously Rob has good

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.160 
together and then obviously Rob has good
flexibility<00:04:15.300> but<00:04:15.690> you're<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.020> going<00:04:16.140> to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
flexibility but you're just going to

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.050 
flexibility but you're just going to
take<00:04:16.410> your<00:04:16.620> hand<00:04:16.860> and<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.489> small<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.880> back

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
take your hand and the small the back

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.320 
take your hand and the small the back
and<00:04:18.330> push<00:04:18.540> them<00:04:18.750> down<00:04:19.020> and<00:04:19.730> forward<00:04:20.730> as<00:04:20.910> you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
and push them down and forward as you

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.710 
and push them down and forward as you
pull<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.900> chest<00:04:22.470> up<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.970> start<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.420> release

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
pull the chest up to start to release

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.620 
pull the chest up to start to release
some<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.020> those<00:04:25.170> areas<00:04:26.060> once<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.240> once<00:04:27.540> you

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
some of those areas once you once you

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.060 
some of those areas once you once you
have<00:04:27.780> Lee<00:04:27.960> feels<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.380> position<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.920> they

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
have Lee feels the position that they

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.180 
have Lee feels the position that they
are<00:04:29.340> supposed<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> be<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.210> Wednesd<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.190> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
are supposed to be in Wednesd and it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.100 
are supposed to be in Wednesd and it
will<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.400> easier<00:04:32.730> for<00:04:32.760> them<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> achieve<00:04:33.270> the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
will be easier for them to achieve the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.090 
will be easier for them to achieve the
other<00:04:34.230> good<00:04:34.470> sheet<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:35.640> we<00:04:35.850> just<00:04:36.090> put<00:04:37.100> small

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
other good sheet if we just put small

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.040 
other good sheet if we just put small
plates<00:04:38.460> underneath<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.240> athletes<00:04:39.630> heels

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
plates underneath the athletes heels

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.270 
plates underneath the athletes heels
squat<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.770> depth<00:04:41.390> good<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.830> makes<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.130> much

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
squat to depth good that makes it much

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.100 
squat to depth good that makes it much
easier<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.910> maintain<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.240> vertical<00:04:45.690> posture

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
easier to maintain a vertical posture

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.220 
easier to maintain a vertical posture
the<00:04:46.680> third<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.190> final<00:04:47.370> stretch<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.900> think

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
the third and final stretch that I think

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.490 
the third and final stretch that I think
is<00:04:49.380> really<00:04:49.560> important<00:04:50.840> especially<00:04:51.840> if<00:04:52.320> you've

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
is really important especially if you've

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.990 
is really important especially if you've
got<00:04:52.530> issues<00:04:53.010> with<00:04:53.040> ankle<00:04:53.460> mobility<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:56.000> with

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
got issues with ankle mobility so with

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.290 
got issues with ankle mobility so with
respect<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:58.010> knees<00:04:59.010> traveling<00:04:59.820> forward

respect to the knees traveling forward

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.930 
respect to the knees traveling forward
it's<00:05:00.870> okay<00:05:01.169> for<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.410> knees<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.710> travel<00:05:02.160> over

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
it's okay for the knees to travel over

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.820 
it's okay for the knees to travel over
the<00:05:03.060> toes<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:03.930> not<00:05:04.110> appropriate<00:05:04.380> for<00:05:04.680> the
