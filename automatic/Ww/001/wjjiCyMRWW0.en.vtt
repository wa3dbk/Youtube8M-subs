150 also there's a there's a lot of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.899 
150 also there's a there's a lot of
different<00:01:07.890> bolt<00:01:08.040> patterns<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.430> between<00:01:08.759> there

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
different bolt patterns in between there

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
different bolt patterns in between there
but<00:01:09.060> today<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> talk<00:01:09.869> strictly

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but today we're going to talk strictly

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.499 
but today we're going to talk strictly
on<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.649> to<00:01:10.710> measure<00:01:11.009> those<00:01:11.250> correctly<00:01:11.729> now

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
on how to measure those correctly now

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.200 
on how to measure those correctly now
here<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.829> have<00:01:14.009> a<00:01:14.039> wheel<00:01:14.429> that's<00:01:14.609> faced<00:01:14.909> down

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
here we have a wheel that's faced down

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.849 
here we have a wheel that's faced down
that<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.960> measure<00:01:16.499> the<00:01:16.740> bolt

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
that we're going to measure the bolt

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.789 
that we're going to measure the bolt
pattern<00:01:17.219> on<00:01:17.929> it's<00:01:18.929> going<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.109> be<00:01:19.259> very<00:01:19.469> simple

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
pattern on it's going to be very simple

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.629 
pattern on it's going to be very simple
but<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.729> real<00:01:21.179> quick<00:01:21.889> on<00:01:22.889> the<00:01:23.280> wheel<00:01:23.429> that's

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
but so real quick on the wheel that's

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.969 
but so real quick on the wheel that's
down<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.240> face<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:24.719> you<00:01:25.679> will<00:01:25.799> see

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
down here that's face down you will see

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.949 
down here that's face down you will see
that<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.249> drawn<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.789> with<00:01:27.359> a<00:01:27.389> black<00:01:27.719> permanent

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
that I've drawn a with a black permanent

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.410 
that I've drawn a with a black permanent
marker<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.679> circle<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.759> goes<00:01:29.819> through<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
marker a circle that goes through the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.370 
marker a circle that goes through the
middle<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.899> each<00:01:31.590> lug<00:01:32.219> hole<00:01:32.459> these<00:01:33.270> lug<00:01:34.139> holes

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
middle of each lug hole these lug holes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.779 
middle of each lug hole these lug holes
are<00:01:34.649> drilled<00:01:34.859> on<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:36.060> center<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.139> circle

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
are drilled on the center of that circle

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.330 
are drilled on the center of that circle
okay<00:01:38.789> so<00:01:38.899> when<00:01:39.899> we<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.200> measure<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:41.039> when<00:01:41.189> we

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
okay so when we do measure up when we

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
okay so when we do measure up when we
measure<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> bolt<00:01:41.939> pattern<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.719> want<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.139> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
measure a bolt pattern we want to know a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.709 
measure a bolt pattern we want to know a
first<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.069> first<00:01:44.340> measurement<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.509> first

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
first the first measurement or the first

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.929 
first the first measurement or the first
number<00:01:46.139> is<00:01:46.319> in<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.950> case<00:01:47.130> five<00:01:47.490> because

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
number is in this case five because

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.599 
number is in this case five because
there's<00:01:48.119> five<00:01:48.479> lug<00:01:48.929> holes<00:01:49.200> drilled<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
there's five lug holes drilled on this

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.109 
there's five lug holes drilled on this
circle<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:52.319> second<00:01:52.799> measurement<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.969> we

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
circle the second measurement that we

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.019 
circle the second measurement that we
want<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.599> find<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.709> diameter<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
want to find is the diameter of the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:58.849 
want to find is the diameter of the
circle<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> runs<00:01:57.990> through<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.439> middle<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.039 
circle that runs through the middle of
each<00:01:59.009> lug<00:01:59.279> hole<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.450> could<00:02:00.599> cut<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
each lug hole so if we could cut this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.129 
each lug hole so if we could cut this
circle<00:02:01.259> directly<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.219> half<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.719> would<00:02:03.899> know

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
circle directly in half we would know

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.980 
circle directly in half we would know
the<00:02:04.349> measurement<00:02:04.859> of<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.759> second<00:02:06.149> number<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the measurement of the second number and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.600 
the measurement of the second number and
our<00:02:07.079> bolt<00:02:07.289> pattern<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.799> example<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
our bolt pattern for example this is a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.510 
our bolt pattern for example this is a
five<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.179> four<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.660> half<00:02:09.899> wheel<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.979> wheel

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
five on four and a half wheel a wheel

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.490 
five on four and a half wheel a wheel
that<00:02:11.580> has<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.940> bolt<00:02:12.270> pattern<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.660> five<00:02:12.959> lugs<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that has a bolt pattern of five lugs on

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
a four and a half inch circle okay so to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.839 
a four and a half inch circle okay so to
measure<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.299> correctly<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:20.370> way<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.730> we

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
measure that correctly the way that we

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.730 
measure that correctly the way that we
have<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.659> five<00:02:21.989> lug<00:02:22.200> wheel

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
have to do it on a five lug wheel

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.620 
have to do it on a five lug wheel
is<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:23.220> need<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.490> measure<00:02:23.670> from<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> center<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
is we need to measure from the center of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
is we need to measure from the center of
one<00:02:24.830> circle<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.070> one<00:02:26.550> lug<00:02:26.790> hole<00:02:27.710> skip<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.950> lug

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
one circle of one lug hole skip a lug

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
one circle of one lug hole skip a lug
hole<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.420> center<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.990> second<00:02:31.410> level

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
hole to the center of a second level

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.010 
hole to the center of a second level
okay<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:32.850> we're<00:02:33.240> not<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.630> measure<00:02:33.840> from

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
okay so we're not going to measure from

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.920 
okay so we're not going to measure from
center<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.700> center<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.570> going<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
center to center we're actually going to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.920 
center to center we're actually going to
measure<00:02:37.320> from<00:02:37.470> center<00:02:37.940> skipping<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.060> hole<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
measure from center skipping a hole to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.700 
measure from center skipping a hole to
center<00:02:40.260> okay<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.730> doing<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.470> we'll<00:02:43.470> place

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
center okay so in doing that we'll place

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.090 
center okay so in doing that we'll place
our<00:02:43.890> ruler<00:02:44.610> or<00:02:44.760> protractor<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.650> our<00:02:46.650> ruler

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
our ruler or protractor here our ruler

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.420 
our ruler or protractor here our ruler
and<00:02:47.510> what<00:02:48.510> we're<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> try<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.710> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and what we're going to try to do and it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.250 
and what we're going to try to do and it
can<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.150> difficult<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:52.140> we're

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
can be a little bit difficult but we're

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
can be a little bit difficult but we're
going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.410> try<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.710> line<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> zero<00:02:53.700> right

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
going to try to line up that zero right

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
going to try to line up that zero right
in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> center<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.770> first<00:02:56.130> lug<00:02:56.430> hole

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
in the center of that first lug hole

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.660 
in the center of that first lug hole
okay<00:02:57.630> then<00:02:58.380> skipping<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.010> lug<00:02:59.220> hole<00:02:59.430> we're

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
okay then skipping a lug hole we're

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.290 
okay then skipping a lug hole we're
going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> go<00:03:00.000> over<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.630> next<00:03:00.810> level<00:03:01.470> now

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
going to go over to the next level now

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
going to go over to the next level now
when<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.330> place<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.140> there<00:03:04.350> real<00:03:04.950> quick

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
when I place that in there real quick

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.140 
when I place that in there real quick
and<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:06.300> measure<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.810> lug<00:03:07.290> pattern<00:03:07.850> from<00:03:08.850> zero

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and I measure that lug pattern from zero

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.780 
and I measure that lug pattern from zero
it<00:03:09.720> comes<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.200> four<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> quarter<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.430> this

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it comes to four and a quarter in this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
it comes to four and a quarter in this
case<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:14.540> again<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.870> said<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
case now again like I said this is a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.370 
case now again like I said this is a
five<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:16.830> four<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.370> half<00:03:17.400> full<00:03:18.300> pattern<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
five on four and a half full pattern the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.170 
five on four and a half full pattern the
reason<00:03:19.770> being<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.310> when<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:20.910> measure

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
reason being is that when we measure

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.960 
reason being is that when we measure
from<00:03:21.510> center<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:22.020> one<00:03:22.200> circle<00:03:22.710> from<00:03:23.460> one<00:03:23.670> stud

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
from center of one circle from one stud

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.700 
from center of one circle from one stud
hole<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.750> center<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.290> other<00:03:25.380> stud

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
hole to the center of the other stud

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.010 
hole to the center of the other stud
hole<00:03:25.950> we<00:03:26.550> are<00:03:26.580> not<00:03:26.880> cutting<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:28.560> circle

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
hole we are not cutting this circle

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.420 
hole we are not cutting this circle
completely<00:03:31.020> in<00:03:31.080> half<00:03:31.290> okay

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
completely in half okay

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.730 
completely in half okay
so<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.150> five<00:03:33.390> lug<00:03:33.630> wheel<00:03:33.900> we<00:03:34.350> need<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.620> add

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
so on a five lug wheel we need to add

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.370 
so on a five lug wheel we need to add
one<00:03:35.100> quarter<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.580> an<00:03:35.730> inch<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> when<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.020> measure

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
one quarter of an inch so when I measure

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.090 
one quarter of an inch so when I measure
that<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.980> come<00:03:38.220> up<00:03:38.370> with<00:03:38.400> five<00:03:39.800> lug<00:03:40.800> holes

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
that and I come up with five lug holes

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.010 
that and I come up with five lug holes
with<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.460> four<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> quarter<00:03:42.330> spread<00:03:42.840> in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
with the four and a quarter spread in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.500 
with the four and a quarter spread in
between<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> two<00:03:43.710> locals<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:45.180> one

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
between the two locals I have one

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.450 
between the two locals I have one
quarter<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.930> an<00:03:46.050> inch

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
quarter of an inch

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.570 
quarter of an inch
okay<00:03:47.460> so<00:03:48.090> again<00:03:48.380> center<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.530> one<00:03:49.740> stud<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:50.070> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
okay so again center of one stud to the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.130 
okay so again center of one stud to the
center<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> next<00:03:51.300> stud<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.840> add<00:03:52.110> a

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
center of the next stud and add a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.840 
center of the next stud and add a
quarter<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.620> an<00:03:52.710> inch<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.340> four<00:03:53.610> five

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
quarter of an inch and that's four five

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.030 
quarter of an inch and that's four five
lug<00:03:54.150> wheels<00:03:54.450> only<00:03:54.840> or<00:03:55.020> five<00:03:55.350> lug<00:03:55.590> vehicles

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
