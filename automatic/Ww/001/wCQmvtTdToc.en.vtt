00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this the way that everything's gonna go

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.019 
this the way that everything's gonna go

think it will still you know I don't
think<00:04:55.070> Game<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.280> Thrones<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.760> suddenly<00:04:56.030> you

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
think Game of Thrones is suddenly you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.970 
think Game of Thrones is suddenly you
know<00:04:56.570> any<00:04:56.780> future<00:04:57.169> seasons<00:04:57.620> gonna<00:04:57.800> get

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
know any future seasons gonna get

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.620 
know any future seasons gonna get
released<00:04:58.250> all<00:04:58.430> at<00:04:58.460> once<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.940> think<00:04:59.180> this<00:04:59.389> is<00:04:59.510> an

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
released all at once I think this is an

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.320 
released all at once I think this is an
alternative<00:05:00.350> way<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:01.310> will<00:05:01.490> change<00:05:02.090> things

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
alternative way that will change things

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.360 
alternative way that will change things
somewhat<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.500> think<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:03.800> also<00:05:03.950> like<00:05:04.250> it

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
somewhat but I think it's also like it

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.250 
somewhat but I think it's also like it
didn't<00:05:04.610> why<00:05:04.790> are<00:05:04.850> we<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.810> know<00:05:05.900> we<00:05:06.020> have

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
didn't why are we you know we have

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.659 
didn't why are we you know we have
somebody<00:05:06.440> arbitrary<00:05:06.979> things<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.460> we<00:05:07.550> do

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
somebody arbitrary things that we do

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.070 
somebody arbitrary things that we do
things<00:05:07.910> TV<00:05:08.210> shows<00:05:08.389> come<00:05:08.570> on<00:05:08.660> once<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.930> week

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
things TV shows come on once a week

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.120 
things TV shows come on once a week
because<00:05:09.139> that's<00:05:09.410> what<00:05:09.500> we<00:05:09.560> decided<00:05:09.830> they

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
because that's what we decided they

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.090 
because that's what we decided they
don't<00:05:10.340> want<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.669> wait<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.270> we<00:05:11.389> say<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.690> know

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500

this country and and maybe that will

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.100 
this country and and maybe that will
change<00:05:55.940> too<00:05:56.300> which<00:05:56.419> would<00:05:56.570> be<00:05:56.690> interesting<00:05:56.810> if

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
change too which would be interesting if

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.690
