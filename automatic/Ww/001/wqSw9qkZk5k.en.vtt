your<00:00:01.170> body<00:00:01.410> skin<00:00:01.770> cells<00:00:02.040> are<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.790> prime<00:00:03.149> example

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
your body skin cells are a prime example

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.039 
your body skin cells are a prime example
of<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.899> cell<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.290> body<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.799> goes<00:00:05.040> through

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
of a cell in the body that goes through

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
of a cell in the body that goes through
mitosis<00:00:07.049> mitosis<00:00:07.799> being<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.790> process<00:00:09.389> that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
mitosis mitosis being the process that

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
mitosis mitosis being the process that
your<00:00:09.840> cells<00:00:10.110> go<00:00:10.349> through<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.830> divide<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.090> you

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
your cells go through to divide so you

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
your cells go through to divide so you
might<00:00:12.450> remember<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.710> lectures<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
might remember from the lectures that a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.060 
might remember from the lectures that a
cell<00:00:14.940> does<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.710> grow<00:00:17.150> larger<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.270> larger<00:00:19.070> but

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
cell does not grow larger and larger but

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
cell does not grow larger and larger but
it<00:00:20.189> divides<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.869> basically<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.650> your

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it divides and that's basically for your

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
it divides and that's basically for your
skin<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.760> able<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> get

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
skin that's how you you're able to get

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810 
skin that's how you you're able to get
full<00:00:25.050> coverage<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:25.680> body<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.609> skin

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
full coverage of your body now your skin

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.050 
full coverage of your body now your skin
is<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.420> large<00:00:27.779> massive<00:00:28.380> cell<00:00:29.060> but

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
is not one large massive cell but

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.330 
is not one large massive cell but
millions<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> millions<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> cells<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> are

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
millions and millions of cells that are

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.330 
millions and millions of cells that are
continually<00:00:32.790> dividing<00:00:33.770> one<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> prime

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
continually dividing one of the prime

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.080 
continually dividing one of the prime
examples<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.600> your<00:00:37.050> skin<00:00:37.350> cells<00:00:37.530> divide

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
examples of how your skin cells divide

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.209 
examples of how your skin cells divide
and<00:00:39.090> why<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.719> need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> divide<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.860> because

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and why they need to divide is because

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
and why they need to divide is because
your<00:00:41.340> skin<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.730> continually<00:00:42.329> being<00:00:42.510> exposed

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
your skin is continually being exposed

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
your skin is continually being exposed
to<00:00:43.200> external<00:00:43.739> environment<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to external environment so you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.119 
to external environment so you
constantly<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.020> new<00:00:46.860> layer<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
constantly need and you a new layer of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.380 
constantly need and you a new layer of
skin<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> keep<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> protection<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
skin to keep up with the protection of

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.549 
skin to keep up with the protection of
external<00:00:51.390> stimulus<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:54.079> for<00:00:55.079> example<00:00:55.440> your

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
external stimulus so for example your

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
external stimulus so for example your
skin<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.219> face<00:00:57.170> you're<00:00:58.170> constantly

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
skin your your face you're constantly

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.819 
skin your your face you're constantly
fluffing<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.489> dead<00:00:59.820> skin<00:01:00.000> cells<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.379> expose

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
fluffing off dead skin cells to expose

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.310 
fluffing off dead skin cells to expose
brand-new<00:01:02.399> cells<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.449> those<00:01:03.629> brand<00:01:03.930> new<00:01:04.049> cells

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
brand-new cells or those brand new cells

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
brand-new cells or those brand new cells
underneath<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.890> constantly<00:01:05.519> dividing<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
underneath are constantly dividing and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
underneath are constantly dividing and
they're<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.960> through<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.740> phase<00:01:07.979> called

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're going through this phase called

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.750 
they're going through this phase called
interphase<00:01:08.850> okay<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.500> every<00:01:11.159> cell<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
interphase okay so every cell is going

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
interphase okay so every cell is going
through<00:01:12.030> interphase<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> DNA<00:01:13.500> which

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
through interphase where the DNA which

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.660 
through interphase where the DNA which
is<00:01:14.119> all<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.659> looks<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.140> messy<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is all in here looks really messy so the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.230 
is all in here looks really messy so the
DNA<00:01:18.030> during<00:01:18.659> interphase<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.500> dividing<00:01:20.240> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
DNA during interphase is dividing it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.030 
DNA during interphase is dividing it's
going<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:21.750> its<00:01:21.869> normal<00:01:22.020> processes<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
going through its normal processes of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.390 
going through its normal processes of
growing<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.979> cellular

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
growing and you know cellular

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.359 
growing and you know cellular
respiration<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.330> what-have-you

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
respiration and what-have-you

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.020 
respiration and what-have-you
so<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:29.939> cells<00:01:30.180> divide<00:01:31.850> mitosis<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so as these cells divide mitosis is a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
so as these cells divide mitosis is a
stage<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.960> cell<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.439> preparing

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
stage in which the cell is preparing

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.050 
stage in which the cell is preparing
itself<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:36.329> divide<00:01:37.130> into<00:01:38.130> another<00:01:38.430> another

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
itself to divide into another another

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.819 
itself to divide into another another
pair<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> cells<00:01:39.720> okay<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.850> divides

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
pair of cells okay so when it divides

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.300 
pair of cells okay so when it divides
both<00:01:43.829> cells<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.869> genetically<00:01:45.869> identical

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
both cells are genetically identical

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.770 
both cells are genetically identical
okay<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> exact<00:01:48.119> same<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
okay you have the exact same of the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.960 
okay you have the exact same of the
exact<00:01:49.320> same<00:01:49.560> amount<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.920> material<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
exact same amount of material and the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
exact same amount of material and the
new<00:01:51.149> cell<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> did<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> old<00:01:52.320> cell<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
new cell as you did with the old cell so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
new cell as you did with the old cell so
it's<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> completely<00:01:53.490> makes<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.000> complete

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's a completely makes a complete

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.249 
it's a completely makes a complete
replica<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.990> itself<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.210> itself<00:01:57.630> parent

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
replica of itself so as itself parent

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.190 
replica of itself so as itself parent
prepares<00:01:58.590> itself<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.329> mitosis<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.930> for

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
prepares itself for mitosis or for

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
prepares itself for mitosis or for
division<00:02:01.729> interphase<00:02:04.759> interface<00:02:05.759> makes<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
division interphase interface makes a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
division interphase interface makes a
identical<00:02:07.380> copy<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> DNA<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.550> then

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
identical copy of the DNA and then

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.600 
identical copy of the DNA and then
nucleus<00:02:09.200> okay<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> slowly

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
nucleus okay and it kind of slowly

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
nucleus okay and it kind of slowly
phases<00:02:12.150> its<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.480> into

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
phases its way into

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.250 
phases its way into
prophase<00:02:14.129> okay<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> kind<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.110> make

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
prophase okay now just to kind of make

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.479 
prophase okay now just to kind of make
this<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.680> easier<00:02:17.180> one<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
this a little easier one of the one of

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.470 
this a little easier one of the one of
the<00:02:20.580> anecca<00:02:20.849> names<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.300> should

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the anecca names that you should

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.400 
the anecca names that you should
remember<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:22.709> will<00:02:22.920> make<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.220> easier<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
remember which will make this easier is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.800 
remember which will make this easier is
P<00:02:27.110> Matt<00:02:28.220> okay<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> stages

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
P Matt okay this is one of the stages

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.839 
P Matt okay this is one of the stages
this<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> last<00:02:31.680> stage<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.280> interphase

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
this is the last stage of interphase

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.680 
this is the last stage of interphase
okay

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
okay

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.270 
okay
interphase<00:02:34.379> has<00:02:34.650> three<00:02:35.420> has<00:02:36.420> three<00:02:36.810> stages

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
interphase has three has three stages

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.369 
interphase has three has three stages
okay<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:39.120> we'll<00:02:39.569> talk<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:40.019> those<00:02:40.200> three

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
okay now we'll talk about those three

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.580 
okay now we'll talk about those three
stages<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.950> another<00:02:41.280> video<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.379> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
stages in another video but one of the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.789 
stages in another video but one of the
last<00:02:43.799> stages<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:45.319> mitosis<00:02:47.720> okay<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.959> mitosis

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
last stages is mitosis okay and mitosis

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.240 
last stages is mitosis okay and mitosis
is<00:02:49.950> broken<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.430> into<00:02:50.989> these<00:02:51.989> four<00:02:52.410> sub<00:02:52.950> stages

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
is broken up into these four sub stages

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.210 
is broken up into these four sub stages
okay<00:02:53.940> first<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.989> going<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.319> prophase

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
okay first one is going to be prophase

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.030 
okay first one is going to be prophase
and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:58.470> metaphase<00:02:59.220> anaphase<00:03:00.980> use<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and then metaphase anaphase use a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
and then metaphase anaphase use a
different<00:03:02.340> color

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
different color

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.869 
different color
prophase<00:03:03.690> metaphase<00:03:03.989> anaphase<00:03:04.879> and

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
prophase metaphase anaphase and

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.670 
prophase metaphase anaphase and
telophase<00:03:07.069> okay<00:03:08.069> or<00:03:08.310> cytokinesis<00:03:09.230> now<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.500> my

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
telophase okay or cytokinesis now in my

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.809 
telophase okay or cytokinesis now in my
diagram<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.310> you're<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.579> see<00:03:11.730> if

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
diagram here you're going to see if

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.410 
diagram here you're going to see if
there's<00:03:12.000> an<00:03:12.090> extra<00:03:12.209> step<00:03:12.989> here<00:03:13.280> prometaphase

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
there's an extra step here prometaphase

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.550 
there's an extra step here prometaphase
you<00:03:15.420> don't<00:03:15.569> have<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.810> necessarily<00:03:15.930> remember

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you don't have to necessarily remember

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280 
you don't have to necessarily remember
that<00:03:16.829> just<00:03:17.280> remember<00:03:17.549> prometaphase<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
that just remember prometaphase is a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.610 
that just remember prometaphase is a
stage<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:20.040> between<00:03:21.500> prophase<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:22.920> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
stage in between prophase here and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.860 
stage in between prophase here and
metaphase<00:03:25.620> okay<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.790> you'll<00:03:27.299> understand<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
metaphase okay so you'll understand the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.470 
metaphase okay so you'll understand the
need<00:03:28.049> for<00:03:28.079> or<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:29.130> know<00:03:29.250> why<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.970> particular

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
need for or you know why this particular

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.180 
need for or you know why this particular
textbook<00:03:30.989> out<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.970> extra<00:03:33.450> step<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
textbook out of this this extra step so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
textbook out of this this extra step so
again<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.329> into<00:03:36.450> prophase<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.410> might

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
again we go into prophase you might

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.740 
again we go into prophase you might
notice<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:39.269> DNA<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.829> DNA<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.579> now<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.359> lot

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
notice that the DNA the DNA is now a lot

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.740 
notice that the DNA the DNA is now a lot
more<00:03:42.780> nicely<00:03:43.709> tightly<00:03:44.400> organized<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.389> it's

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
more nicely tightly organized and it's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.289 
more nicely tightly organized and it's
actually<00:03:46.109> it's<00:03:46.530> copied<00:03:46.950> now<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.090> been

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
actually it's copied now so it's been

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.750 
actually it's copied now so it's been
copied<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.049> now<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.590> two<00:03:49.919> copies<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.549> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
copied so now you have two copies of the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.990 
copied so now you have two copies of the
of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> DNA<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:51.870> it's<00:03:52.829> nicely<00:03:53.160> tight<00:03:53.639> it's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
of the DNA and it's nicely tight it's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.150 
of the DNA and it's nicely tight it's
tightly<00:03:54.299> packed<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.959> organized<00:03:55.470> now<00:03:55.709> into

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
tightly packed and organized now into

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.670 
tightly packed and organized now into
something<00:03:56.400> called<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:57.030> centromere<00:03:57.569> okay<00:03:58.470> or

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
something called a centromere okay or

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.339 
something called a centromere okay or
chromosomes<00:03:59.370> your<00:04:00.209> chromosomes<00:04:00.750> are<00:04:01.049> wait

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
chromosomes your chromosomes are wait

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.199 
chromosomes your chromosomes are wait
are<00:04:01.680> what<00:04:02.190> carry<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.609> genetic<00:04:03.060> material

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
are what carry your genetic material

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.780 
are what carry your genetic material
that<00:04:03.660> are<00:04:03.870> passed<00:04:04.139> on<00:04:04.349> from<00:04:04.560> appearance<00:04:05.250> to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
that are passed on from appearance to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.569 
that are passed on from appearance to
somebody<00:04:06.329> able<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> child<00:04:07.109> or<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.250> genetic

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
somebody able to a child or the genetic

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.159 
somebody able to a child or the genetic
material<00:04:08.970> that's<00:04:09.090> passed<00:04:09.299> on<00:04:09.480> from<00:04:09.630> one<00:04:09.900> cell

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
material that's passed on from one cell

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.930 
material that's passed on from one cell
to<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.500> next<00:04:10.530> oh<00:04:10.859> that's<00:04:11.099> that's<00:04:11.579> that's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
to the next oh that's that's that's

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.449 
to the next oh that's that's that's
shared<00:04:12.440> you'll<00:04:13.440> also<00:04:13.650> notice<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
shared you'll also notice that the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.279 
shared you'll also notice that the
spindle<00:04:14.790> apparatus<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.569> beginning<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:15.989> take<00:04:16.229> a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
spindle apparatus is beginning to take a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.289 
spindle apparatus is beginning to take a
little<00:04:16.560> bit<00:04:16.680> more<00:04:16.739> form<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.729> compare<00:04:18.180> it

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
little bit more form if you compare it

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.810 
little bit more form if you compare it
to<00:04:18.750> two<00:04:19.709> interface<00:04:20.190> where<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.549> have<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
to two interface where you have the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.730 
to two interface where you have the
centrioles<00:04:21.299> well<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.690> centrioles<00:04:22.200> now<00:04:22.440> are

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
centrioles well the centrioles now are

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.880 
centrioles well the centrioles now are
beginning<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.640> form<00:04:23.880> their<00:04:24.890> microtubules

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
beginning to form their microtubules

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.990 
beginning to form their microtubules
okay<00:04:26.669> or

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
okay or

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.930 
okay or
they're<00:04:27.180> asters<00:04:27.660> okay<00:04:28.440> these<00:04:29.130> microtubules

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
they're asters okay these microtubules

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.780 
they're asters okay these microtubules
play<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> very<00:04:30.750> important<00:04:31.320> part<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.920> helping

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
play a very important part and helping

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.990 
play a very important part and helping
to<00:04:32.940> organize<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.960> DNA<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.700> in<00:04:35.880> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
to organize the DNA that is in the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.660 
to organize the DNA that is in the
nucleus<00:04:36.420> okay<00:04:37.230> it<00:04:37.680> helps<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.070> organize<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
nucleus okay it helps to organize the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.760 
nucleus okay it helps to organize the
DNA<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.360> it's<00:04:39.480> going<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> later<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.080> help<00:04:40.560> to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
DNA and it's going to later on help to

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.820 
DNA and it's going to later on help to
separate<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.700> DNA<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.750> copy<00:04:42.990> DNA<00:04:43.230> from<00:04:43.680> one

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
separate the DNA the copy DNA from one

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.500 
separate the DNA the copy DNA from one
cell<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.280> another<00:04:44.310> okay

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
cell to another okay

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.470 
cell to another okay
so<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.680> again<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.550> step<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.300> don't

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
so just again a step that you don't

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.080 
so just again a step that you don't
necessarily<00:04:48.660> need<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.290> remember<00:04:49.680> for<00:04:50.100> test

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
necessarily need to remember for test

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.510 
necessarily need to remember for test
purposes<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:52.140> it's<00:04:52.830> good<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> know<00:04:53.280> is

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
purposes but it's it's good to know is

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.940 
purposes but it's it's good to know is
that<00:04:54.150> you'll<00:04:54.810> notice<00:04:55.050> you're<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.650> difference

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
that you'll notice you're the difference

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.460 
that you'll notice you're the difference
between<00:04:56.100> our<00:04:56.730> prophase<00:04:57.450> here<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.140> then<00:04:58.320> our

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
between our prophase here and then our

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.890 
between our prophase here and then our
metaphase<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.640> the<00:05:00.120> nuclear<00:05:00.630> envelope

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
metaphase is that the nuclear envelope

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.970 
metaphase is that the nuclear envelope
has<00:05:01.770> now<00:05:01.980> disintegrated<00:05:03.140> okay<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.680> you<00:05:04.740> have<00:05:04.950> a

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
has now disintegrated okay so you have a

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.070 
has now disintegrated okay so you have a
disintegrative<00:05:05.700> nuclear<00:05:06.270> envelope<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.960> then

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
disintegrative nuclear envelope and then

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.050 
disintegrative nuclear envelope and then
you<00:05:07.169> have<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.380> more<00:05:07.770> clearly<00:05:08.190> defined<00:05:08.820> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
you have a more clearly defined and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.640 
you have a more clearly defined and
organized<00:05:10.310> chromosome<00:05:11.900> okay<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.500> you'll

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
organized chromosome okay so you'll

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.370 
organized chromosome okay so you'll
notice<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.040> these<00:05:14.970> chromosomes<00:05:15.510> also<00:05:16.110> have

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
notice that these chromosomes also have

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.570 
notice that these chromosomes also have
something<00:05:17.070> called<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.760> kind<00:05:18.630> of<00:05:18.780> core<00:05:19.550> okay

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
something called a kind of core okay

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.890 
something called a kind of core okay
these<00:05:21.090> kind<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.510> cores

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
these kind of cores

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.620 
these kind of cores
or<00:05:22.200> these<00:05:22.410> are<00:05:22.919> located<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> centromere

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
or these are located in the centromere

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.110 
or these are located in the centromere
in<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.840> center<00:05:25.169> of<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.580> chromosome

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
in the center of the of the chromosome

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.830 
in the center of the of the chromosome
so<00:05:27.810> here<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.320> your<00:05:28.620> chromosome<00:05:29.840> okay

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
so here you have your chromosome okay

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.630 
so here you have your chromosome okay
and<00:05:31.110> then<00:05:31.260> here's<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.560> identical<00:05:31.860> copy<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.430> it

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
and then here's the identical copy of it

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.890 
and then here's the identical copy of it
and<00:05:32.790> then<00:05:33.510> in<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.720> middle<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:34.169> have<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:36.780> the

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
and then in the middle you have in the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.240 
and then in the middle you have in the
centromere<00:05:37.350> you<00:05:37.440> have<00:05:37.590> your<00:05:37.740> kind<00:05:37.950> of<00:05:38.040> form

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
centromere you have your kind of form

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.730 
centromere you have your kind of form
okay<00:05:38.640> these<00:05:39.270> are<00:05:39.419> these<00:05:39.930> are<00:05:40.050> proteins<00:05:40.560> that

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
okay these are these are proteins that

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.219 
okay these are these are proteins that
the<00:05:41.310> these<00:05:41.760> microtubules<00:05:42.600> will<00:05:42.870> attach<00:05:43.200> to

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
the these microtubules will attach to

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.200 
the these microtubules will attach to
and<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:45.090> later<00:05:45.270> going<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.630> help<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.820> even<00:05:47.820> the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
and are later going to help and even the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.060 
and are later going to help and even the
dividing<00:05:48.870> up<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.140> DNA<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:49.770> in<00:05:49.919> these

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
dividing up the DNA that is in these

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.990 
dividing up the DNA that is in these
chromosomes<00:05:50.720> okay<00:05:51.750> so<00:05:52.470> let<00:05:53.280> me<00:05:53.370> go<00:05:53.520> ahead<00:05:53.550> and

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
chromosomes okay so let me go ahead and

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.380 
chromosomes okay so let me go ahead and
erase<00:05:54.620> what<00:05:55.620> we<00:05:55.650> have<00:05:55.919> here<00:05:56.250> just<00:05:56.580> so<00:05:57.120> we<00:05:57.240> can

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
erase what we have here just so we can

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.310 
erase what we have here just so we can
have<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.110> nicer<00:05:58.590> board<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.490> look<00:05:59.610> at<00:06:00.260> so<00:06:01.260> again

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
have a nicer board to look at so again

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.290 
have a nicer board to look at so again
just<00:06:01.620> quick<00:06:01.800> review<00:06:02.100> of<00:06:03.320> prometaphase<00:06:05.300> your

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
just quick review of prometaphase your

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.409 
just quick review of prometaphase your
nuclear<00:06:06.660> envelope<00:06:06.810> is<00:06:07.290> disintegrating<00:06:08.419> your

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
nuclear envelope is disintegrating your

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.510 
nuclear envelope is disintegrating your
chromosomes<00:06:10.080> are<00:06:10.320> a<00:06:10.350> lot<00:06:10.650> more<00:06:10.680> tightly<00:06:11.190> neat

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
chromosomes are a lot more tightly neat

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.870 
chromosomes are a lot more tightly neat
and<00:06:11.760> packed<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.410> your<00:06:13.410> spindle<00:06:14.010> apparatus<00:06:14.220> is

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
and packed and your spindle apparatus is

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.740 
and packed and your spindle apparatus is
now<00:06:15.800> connecting<00:06:16.800> itself<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:18.180> chromosomes

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
now connecting itself to the chromosomes

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.540 
now connecting itself to the chromosomes
and<00:06:18.990> preparing<00:06:19.919> it<00:06:20.040> to<00:06:20.070> be<00:06:20.400> divided<00:06:20.760> okay<00:06:21.600> so

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
and preparing it to be divided okay so

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.010 
and preparing it to be divided okay so
you<00:06:23.550> can<00:06:23.760> guess<00:06:23.940> of<00:06:24.120> what's<00:06:24.330> going<00:06:24.570> to<00:06:24.630> be<00:06:24.690> next

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
you can guess of what's going to be next

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.469 
you can guess of what's going to be next
what<00:06:25.500> state<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:25.890> gonna<00:06:26.070> be<00:06:26.220> next<00:06:26.550> we<00:06:26.880> had<00:06:29.479> we

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
what state is gonna be next we had we

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.850 
what state is gonna be next we had we
had<00:06:30.740> prophase<00:06:31.740> here<00:06:33.080> metaphase<00:06:34.110> well

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
had prophase here metaphase well

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.920 
had prophase here metaphase well
actually<00:06:35.039> metaphase<00:06:35.970> will<00:06:36.180> be<00:06:36.270> what's<00:06:36.450> next

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
actually metaphase will be what's next

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.200 
actually metaphase will be what's next
after<00:06:37.229> prophase<00:06:37.890> we<00:06:38.070> go<00:06:38.220> to<00:06:38.580> metaphase<00:06:38.970> which

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
after prophase we go to metaphase which

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.270 
after prophase we go to metaphase which
is<00:06:39.450> on

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
is on

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.450 
is on
in<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.610> next<00:06:40.820> video<00:06:41.180> and<00:06:42.110> before<00:06:43.070> we<00:06:43.310> had

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
in the next video and before we had

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.120 
in the next video and before we had
prophase<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.210> metaphase<00:06:44.720> we<00:06:44.930> had<00:06:45.130> interphase

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
prophase and metaphase we had interphase

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.200 
prophase and metaphase we had interphase
which<00:06:46.160> was<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:46.880> preparation<00:06:47.290> for<00:06:49.210> for

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
which was the preparation for for

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.380 
which was the preparation for for
mitosis<00:06:51.220> okay<00:06:52.220> so<00:06:52.610> the<00:06:52.730> next<00:06:52.850> video<00:06:53.030> we're

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
mitosis okay so the next video we're

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.940 
mitosis okay so the next video we're
going<00:06:53.510> to<00:06:53.660> finish<00:06:53.840> this<00:06:54.020> up<00:06:54.170> by<00:06:54.350> talking<00:06:54.410> about

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
going to finish this up by talking about

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.710 
going to finish this up by talking about
metaphase<00:06:55.550> anaphase<00:06:56.620> and<00:06:57.620> telophase
