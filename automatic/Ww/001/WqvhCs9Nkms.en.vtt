00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.729
 very good friends today I will make a 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.380
 video miles as you can see and it's that 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.570
 I'm going to show you how everything works with 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.169
 cash vale has finally taken the last 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.600
 update that gives a little bit of 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.940
 the pileup the pileup as I told you in 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.190
 boxing is good for a lot only 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.340
 to share videos from youtube or 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.340
 videos and images that you have on your mobile 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.870
 or the tablet basically because some 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.130
 more application that is compatible but 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.950
 they are quite unhelpful 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.470
 and well I will show you this new 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.350
 functionality that finally comes out with this 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.230
 version that announced the aguayo and that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.860
 it is neither more nor less than being able to share 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860
 the screen 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.660
 the mobile phone or the tablet the mobile phone has 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.790
 crashed but that ignores and 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.520
 look what I 'm going to do that is in the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.070
 chronic screen application 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.530
 screen cast house screen and no 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.970
 I configured what I connect with microwave that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.480
 of course it has to be in the same 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.930
 wifi not the one I'm sharing 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.600
 and doing good the case of the mobile comes out 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.480
 vertically on the other side the tablet 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 which is horizontal but basically what 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.670
 what to teach is that it shows us 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.510
 perfectly what we have in the mobile 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.120
 let's be where we are 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:31.150
 imagine for example the pop application 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.750
 with time worth to see heavy videos 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 our horizontal with this application 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 you can watch a movie from here not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.520
 the only problem encountered with this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 to find him porn 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.380
 the only problem they have found 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.380
 the average meter 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.040
 it's in terms of video 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 marine quality we are obviously using 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 a mobile application and doing 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.159
 streaming to TV is using the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.490
 same wifi to receive from the internet the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.140
 the movie or the video and at the same time the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.239
 same fact of wifi to send it to the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.489
 television not by the same router 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.470
 etcetera then this makes the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.670
 Video quality is not very good though 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 let's see 1080p 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.829
 let's see the movie for example for 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.780
 what I mean to be talking about the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.080
 movie you already know that with time is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 much motivation what for 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 to watch movies by tower 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.930
 with subtitles and such 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.670
 for its p2p technology happens is that if 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.650
 from the mobile already more or less sun tablet 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.090
 It's complicated because we did it right now 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060
 wifi to share it to have them 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.060
 few but are uses that we can give 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.709
 until this clone here new that before not 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.690
 they were and that can be very useful 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.790
 also for games it has occurred to me 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 things for games I do not over for a 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.159
 little be totally compatible that for 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.829
 issue it with this this sharing of 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.079
 screen from the mobile because because 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.519
 it has a small small valuable delay 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.280
 delay in a game can be vital 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.170
 obviously for a new porn movie 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.230
 we are going to be a lot but as you will see 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.450
 now the quality is not bad but it is not 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.250
 the same as catching pop with time in the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 computer and where is your television in 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.760
 your people up 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.950
 let's see if he 's in the movie 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.380
 downloading 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.810
 yes 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.420
 there is great quality in speaking of 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.400
 trancas that shows everything he has in 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420
 screen can be useful for example for 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.460
 make some video of an application 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.460
 clear I can not teach directly in 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.080
 the TV or making noise is not 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.750
 I could capture 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.600
 I do not know if I think this could be the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.240
 capture and capture directly there 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.450
 the video would be milk but I do not know if the 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.510
 own capturing itself often I 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.900
 I would recognize it in the whole case 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.599
 you see what utilities it has several and 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.290
 I say I do not know if you do not see anything wrong 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.290
 Really 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.270
 in the portrait we are seeing our 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.130
 legacy that we have the fence 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.130
 things that happen these things from the live 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.800
 it's some sound problem 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.990
 well you really think that 's it 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.250
 but there are problems some problem of 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.300
 sound I also found in the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.710
 videos and a small one the ticket that is not 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.160
 coming back here sometimes yes yes we are 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.800
 knowing there is saying how good is the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.590
 beta and it shows but it's something that is 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.600
 interesting then to watch videos in 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.110
 other places other than youtube by 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.520
 example and the cen money or any 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.180
 website that has a video 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.180
 that we can see 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.220
 I for what more is for the videos 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.500
 because good to share applications 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.660
 also from the application teach to 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.300
 someone but I'm shared 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.970
 automatically the whole screen is 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.530
 really much more useful gives you much more 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.520
 utility to the puppy of this that only 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.520
 It's worth 35 euros 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.159
 if you have utility you have to host 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.790
 this can stop me because it is in the 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.890
 work at 35 hours 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.890
 Now it's worth it when I did 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.470
 a box and I bought TV from the dining room 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.110
 second time I want to see would do some video 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.480
 youtube but more thinking about this future 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.580
 that someone hack into this and they 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.830
 could share more things 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.780
 you do not need to hack luckily 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.939
 been the google itself that is given 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.069
 mind that you can get more 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.780
 performance without leaving them more rooms the 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:11.340
 quality is pretty pretty short 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.969
 Well, we can still get this out 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.600
 by 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.730
 for curt to go a little 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.650
 but as I told you to know can 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.320
 get it out of your utility is interesting 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.380
 Well, we leave this little analysis 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.120
 of anger until here of the new version 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.039
 you also have links to download the 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.960
 new version if the 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.569
 upgrade 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.500
 the apk directly and a greeting and we 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.500
 we see in the next destination
