Bruce<00:00:23.189> asked<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> mean<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:24.779> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
Bruce asked what do you mean when you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.000 
Bruce asked what do you mean when you
say<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.680> battery

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
say you're going to make a battery

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410 
say you're going to make a battery
that's<00:00:26.039> five<00:00:26.369> times<00:00:26.580> energy<00:00:26.939> density<00:00:27.330> at

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that's five times energy density at

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
that's five times energy density at
one-fifth<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> cost<00:00:28.140> let<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:29.010> answer<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
one-fifth the cost let me answer that a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.519 
one-fifth the cost let me answer that a
little<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.210> way<00:00:30.359> today<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.380> have

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
little in this way today we have

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
little in this way today we have
electric<00:00:31.920> cars<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> Nissan<00:00:32.880> Leaf<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
electric cars like the Nissan Leaf that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
electric cars like the Nissan Leaf that
can<00:00:33.510> go<00:00:33.630> 70<00:00:33.989> miles<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.770> charge<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.760> really

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
can go 70 miles in one charge we really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
can go 70 miles in one charge we really
want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> go<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.510> much<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> gasoline<00:00:37.380> car

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
want to go as much as a gasoline car

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.619 
want to go as much as a gasoline car
which<00:00:37.770> would<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:38.010> 350<00:00:38.640> miles<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> would

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which would be 350 miles so that would

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.299 
which would be 350 miles so that would
be<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> battery<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> has<00:00:40.320> five<00:00:40.680> times<00:00:40.950> energy

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
be a battery that has five times energy

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.380 
be a battery that has five times energy
density<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.270> shooting

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
density so that's what we're shooting

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
density so that's what we're shooting
for<00:00:42.620> when<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> ask<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> Department<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
for when you ask the Department of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
for when you ask the Department of
Energy<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> cost<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> battery

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
Energy what the cost of the battery

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
Energy what the cost of the battery
ought<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.670> everybody<00:00:48.180> drive<00:00:48.660> an

ought to be to make everybody drive an
electric<00:00:48.870> car<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.829> turns<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> batteries

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
electric car it turns out the batteries

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
electric car it turns out the batteries
have<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.120> somewhere<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> range<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.079> 125

dollars a kilowatt hour which is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.389 
dollars a kilowatt hour which is
one-fifth<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> cost<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> batteries<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
one-fifth the cost of the batteries that

one-fifth the cost of the batteries that
are<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.640> today<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.690> we're

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
are there today so that's what we're

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.849 
are there today so that's what we're
shooting<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.469> shooting<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.739> a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
cars are affordable a follow up question
was<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> specific<00:01:06.060> things<00:01:06.270> we'll

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
was what are the specific things we'll

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
was what are the specific things we'll
be<00:01:06.450> doing<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.500> 25<00:01:07.890> *<00:01:08.130> energy<00:01:08.520> density<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
be doing to get 25 * energy density so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
be doing to get 25 * energy density so
it<00:01:09.840> turns<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.070> magic

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it turns out there is no one magic

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.100 
it turns out there is no one magic
chemistry<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.840> us<00:01:12.990> to

chemistry that can actually get us to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
chemistry that can actually get us to
those<00:01:13.229> sorts<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> energy<00:01:13.830> density<00:01:14.159> numbers<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
those sorts of energy density numbers so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
those sorts of energy density numbers so
we<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.210> focusing<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> quite<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> few<00:01:16.320> different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we are focusing on quite a few different

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
we are focusing on quite a few different
things<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.280> coming<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.790> some<00:01:18.000> brand<00:01:18.270> new

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
things and coming up with some brand new

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
things and coming up with some brand new
materials<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.200> hope<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.680> us<00:01:19.799> there

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
materials that we hope can get us there

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
materials that we hope can get us there
an<00:01:20.130> example<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.420> moving<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> ions

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
an example of that is moving to ions

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170 
an example of that is moving to ions
that<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.619> higher<00:01:23.310> number<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> charge

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that have higher number of charge

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640 
that have higher number of charge
compared<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> lithium<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.170> lithium<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
compared to lithium so lithium has a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
compared to lithium so lithium has a
plus<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.250> charge<00:01:26.280> they're<00:01:27.090> hoping<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
plus one charge they're hoping to go to

youtube<00:02:28.200> question<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.710> what<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> maximum

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
youtube question is what is the maximum

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
youtube question is what is the maximum
theoretical<00:02:30.240> limit<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.020> energy<00:02:31.350> density<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.770> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
battery turns out that's a very

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.170 
battery turns out that's a very
difficult<00:02:34.050> question<00:02:34.310> what<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.910> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
difficult question what we all think is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.760 
difficult question what we all think is
that<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.600> take<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> lithium<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.530> side

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that if you take a lithium on one side

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.680 
that if you take a lithium on one side
and<00:02:37.920> floating<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.520> other<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.510> make<00:02:39.660> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and floating on the other you can make a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
and floating on the other you can make a
battery<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.110> has<00:02:40.230> very<00:02:40.650> high<00:02:40.710> energy

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
battery that has very high energy

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.500 
battery that has very high energy
density<00:02:41.130> nobody<00:02:42.090> wants<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.300> work<00:02:42.450> with

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
density nobody wants to work with

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.600 
density nobody wants to work with
fluorine<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.680> typically<00:02:44.040> think<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.460> using

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
fluorine so we typically think of using

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.730 
fluorine so we typically think of using
lithium<00:02:44.910> along<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.420> oxygen<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.470> energy

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
lithium along with oxygen the energy

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.620 
lithium along with oxygen the energy
density<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.190> battery<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.910> 10<00:02:48.300> times

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
density of that battery is 10 times

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.390 
density of that battery is 10 times
energy<00:02:49.020> density<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> batteries<00:02:49.710> today<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.250> we

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
energy density of batteries today so we

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640 
energy density of batteries today so we
have<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.550> lot<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.880> room<00:02:51.300> left<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
have a lot of room left but this is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.780 
have a lot of room left but this is
based<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.250> know<00:02:53.430> today<00:02:53.640> about

based on what we know today about
batteries<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.110> things<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.350> want<00:02:55.530> to

do<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> hub<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.130> really<00:02:56.670> understand<00:02:57.150> those

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
do in the hub is really understand those

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.880 
do in the hub is really understand those
limits<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.110> understand<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.830> to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
limits and really understand how to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.530 
limits and really understand how to
define<00:02:59.400> them<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.820> we<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:00.450> know

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
define them so that we can we know

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.330 
define them so that we can we know
exactly<00:03:00.810> where<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.350> compared<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.130> where

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
exactly where we are compared to where

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.180 
exactly where we are compared to where
we<00:03:02.490> can<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.150> question<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:03.870> Dan<00:03:04.110> was<00:03:04.770> how<00:03:05.040> is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
we can be a question from Dan was how is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.710 
we can be a question from Dan was how is
the<00:03:05.280> hub<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> help<00:03:05.880> widespread

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the hub going to help widespread

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.030 
the hub going to help widespread
penetration<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.200> renewables<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.860> grid

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
penetration of renewables on the grid

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
penetration of renewables on the grid
well<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.300> turns<00:03:09.330> out<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.990> when<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.380> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
well it turns out that when you have a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.440 
well it turns out that when you have a
lot<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.740> solar<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.370> wind<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.730> grid<00:03:11.910> one<00:03:12.360> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
lot of solar or wind on the grid one of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.120 
lot of solar or wind on the grid one of
the<00:03:12.540> problems<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.020> face<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.740> these<00:03:13.980> are

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the problems you face is that these are

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.710 
the problems you face is that these are
intermittent<00:03:14.670> sources<00:03:14.790> what<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> mean<00:03:15.570> by<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
intermittent sources what I mean by that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.420 
intermittent sources what I mean by that
is<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.260> Sun<00:03:16.470> doesn't<00:03:16.650> shine<00:03:16.770> all<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> time

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
is the Sun doesn't shine all the time

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.370 
is the Sun doesn't shine all the time
when<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> cloud<00:03:18.180> goes<00:03:18.420> over<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.720> Sun<00:03:18.930> there

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
when the cloud goes over the Sun there

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.810 
when the cloud goes over the Sun there
is<00:03:19.500> no<00:03:19.650> solar<00:03:19.890> energy<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:20.459> coming<00:03:20.550> out<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
is no solar energy that's coming out of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.610 
is no solar energy that's coming out of
the<00:03:20.910> solar<00:03:21.060> panels<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.959> exactly<00:03:22.320> what<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.560> you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the solar panels so exactly what do you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
the solar panels so exactly what do you
do<00:03:22.770> about<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.850> way<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.060> counter<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.660> is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
do about that one way to counter that is

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.660 
do about that one way to counter that is
to<00:03:24.930> use<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> battery<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> problem<00:03:26.550> is

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
to use a battery but the problem is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.710 
to use a battery but the problem is
these<00:03:26.880> batteries<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.360> be<00:03:27.390> very<00:03:27.600> expensive

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
these batteries can be very expensive

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.330 
these batteries can be very expensive
and<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.380> increases<00:03:28.590> cost<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.250> electricity

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and that increases cost of electricity

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.490 
and that increases cost of electricity
so<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> hub<00:03:30.690> they're<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.410> be

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so in the hub they're going to be

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.290 
so in the hub they're going to be
looking<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:32.010> trying<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.280> find<00:03:32.340> batteries<00:03:33.180> that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
looking at trying to find batteries that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.880 
looking at trying to find batteries that
are<00:03:33.330> incredibly<00:03:33.870> cheap<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.770> actually

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
are incredibly cheap that can actually

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.949 
are incredibly cheap that can actually
compete<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.520> gas-fired<00:03:35.910> peaking<00:03:36.270> plans<00:03:36.510> if

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
compete with gas-fired peaking plans if

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.930 
compete with gas-fired peaking plans if
we<00:03:37.200> succeed<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.709> doing<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.130> we<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.790> get<00:03:38.910> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
we succeed in doing that we can get a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.460 
we succeed in doing that we can get a
lot<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.239> penetration<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> renewables<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.380> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
lot of penetration of renewables on the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
lot of penetration of renewables on the
grid<00:03:40.620> without<00:03:40.770> paying<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.220> huge<00:03:41.370> cost<00:03:41.700> penalty

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
grid without paying a huge cost penalty

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.420 
grid without paying a huge cost penalty
Massimo<00:03:43.080> asked<00:03:43.560> how<00:03:43.860> do<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.040> get<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
Massimo asked how do I get to be a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.400 
Massimo asked how do I get to be a
battery<00:03:44.820> scientist<00:03:45.270> well<00:03:45.690> great<00:03:45.870> question

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
battery scientist well great question

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.080 
battery scientist well great question
you<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.709> do<00:03:46.800> exactly<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.580> did<00:03:47.850> if<00:03:48.030> you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
you can do exactly what I did if you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.580 
you can do exactly what I did if you
want<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.330> become<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.540> battery<00:03:48.810> scientist<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
want to become a battery scientist so I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.380 
want to become a battery scientist so I
was<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> chemical<00:03:50.130> engineer<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> got<00:03:51.180> into

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
was a chemical engineer but I got into

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.970 
was a chemical engineer but I got into
doing<00:03:51.660> electrochemistry<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.440> long<00:03:52.650> time<00:03:52.860> ago

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
doing electrochemistry a long time ago

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.680 
doing electrochemistry a long time ago
so<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.580> describe<00:03:54.120> myself<00:03:54.330> as<00:03:54.570> an

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
so I describe myself as an

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.330 
so I describe myself as an
electrochemical<00:03:55.260> engineer<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.770> so<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.070> became

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
electrochemical engineer and so I became

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.160 
electrochemical engineer and so I became
a<00:03:56.489> battery<00:03:56.850> scientist<00:03:57.270> by<00:03:57.600> going<00:03:57.870> down<00:03:58.020> that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
a battery scientist by going down that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.050 
a battery scientist by going down that
path<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.280> also<00:03:59.430> become<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.760> battery

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
path but you can also become a battery

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.190 
path but you can also become a battery
scientist<00:04:00.420> if<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.570> are<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.690> mechanical

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
scientist if you are a mechanical

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720 
scientist if you are a mechanical
engineer<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:02.190> sure<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.370> material

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
engineer and I'm sure a material

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.150 
engineer and I'm sure a material
scientist<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.110> ask<00:04:04.320> me<00:04:04.500> what<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.920> most

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
scientist if you ask me what is the most

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.949 
scientist if you ask me what is the most
important<00:04:05.640> thing<00:04:05.790> we<00:04:05.970> need<00:04:06.300> in<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.540> next<00:04:06.780> five

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
important thing we need in the next five

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.140 
important thing we need in the next five
to<00:04:07.140> ten<00:04:07.290> years<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.950> turns<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.580> we<00:04:08.880> really

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
to ten years it turns out that we really

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.120 
to ten years it turns out that we really
need<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.420> be<00:04:09.630> focusing<00:04:10.170> on<00:04:10.350> new<00:04:10.530> electrolytes

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
need to be focusing on new electrolytes

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.220 
need to be focusing on new electrolytes
that<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.700> use<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.850> batteries<00:04:12.360> what<00:04:13.050> that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
that we can use in batteries what that

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.020 
that we can use in batteries what that
means<00:04:13.410> for<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.920> try<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.610> become<00:04:14.850> an

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
means for you is that try to become an

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.090 
means for you is that try to become an
organic<00:04:15.480> chemist<00:04:15.630> an<00:04:16.019> organic<00:04:16.590> chemist<00:04:16.739> who
