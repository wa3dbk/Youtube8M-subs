major not else my thing is kind of a
good<00:00:15.690> way<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.500> chemistry

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
good way to think about chemistry

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580 
good way to think about chemistry
because<00:00:17.430> heating<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.600> metal<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.289> letting<00:00:19.529> it

because heating up metal and letting it

because heating up metal and letting it
cool<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.369> chemical<00:00:20.670> process<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.720> the

cool down as a chemical process in the
studio<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.710> lots<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> different<00:00:23.250> acids

studio we have lots of different acids
and<00:00:24.480> bases<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.890> give<00:00:26.130> them<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.460> it's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and bases that can give them at all it's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.480 
and bases that can give them at all it's
different<00:00:27.180> patinas<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.859> bit<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> knowledge

different patinas so a bit of knowledge
of<00:00:29.730> chemistry<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> experience

of chemistry can make the experience

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.040 
of chemistry can make the experience
more<00:00:32.130> enjoyable<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.059> when<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> comes

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
more enjoyable I think when it comes

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.319 
more enjoyable I think when it comes
down<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.950> very<00:00:35.100> interesting

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
down to it I think it's very interesting

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.420 
down to it I think it's very interesting
to<00:00:36.329> create<00:00:36.840> something<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.920> both

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to create something that's both

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
to create something that's both
aesthetically<00:00:39.300> pleasing<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.809> also<00:00:40.290> serves

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
aesthetically pleasing but also serves

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
aesthetically pleasing but also serves
the<00:00:41.010> purpose<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> function<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.200> an

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the purpose or a function so an

introductory metal smithing Kelly is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
introductory metal smithing Kelly is
really<00:00:46.140> hands-on<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.070> helping<00:00:47.399> each<00:00:47.579> student

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
really hands-on and helping each student

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.119 
really hands-on and helping each student
learn<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> basics<00:00:49.050> announcement<00:00:49.739> things<00:00:49.890> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
learn the basics announcement things but

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
learn the basics announcement things but
in<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:50.879> independent<00:00:51.390> side<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> these

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in my two independent side of these

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
in my two independent side of these
she's<00:00:52.079> been<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:52.800> hands-off

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
she's been a little bit more hands-off

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.790 
she's been a little bit more hands-off
and<00:00:53.850> letting<00:00:54.420> me<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.140> decisions<00:00:55.440> about

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and letting me make more decisions about

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
and letting me make more decisions about
my<00:00:56.460> aesthetic<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.870> she'll<00:00:58.079> also<00:00:58.320> come

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
my aesthetic but then she'll also come

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.939 
my aesthetic but then she'll also come
in<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> ask<00:00:59.219> me<00:00:59.520> questions<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.680> wonder<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
in and ask me questions and wonder is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
in and ask me questions and wonder is
this<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.730> wanted<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.329> like

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this what I really wanted to look like

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
this what I really wanted to look like
this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.170> should<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> she'll

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this is how it should work and she'll

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.429 
this is how it should work and she'll
challenge<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.119> push<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.290> make

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
challenge me and push me to make

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.760 
challenge me and push me to make
something<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.100> best<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> can

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
something as best as I can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.830 
something as best as I can
casting<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.070> complicated<00:01:11.369> process

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
casting is really complicated process

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
casting is really complicated process
just<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> different<00:01:13.350> steps<00:01:13.530> requires<00:01:14.159> at

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
just all the different steps requires at

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760 
just all the different steps requires at
least<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.760> people<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.200> work<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
least two people to make it work so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
least two people to make it work so
Kelly<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:18.060> work<00:01:18.240> together<00:01:18.420> it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
Kelly and I will work together it's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
Kelly and I will work together it's
actually<00:01:19.740> quite<00:01:19.979> fun<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.150> process<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.750> do

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
actually quite fun in this process we do

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually quite fun in this process we do
its<00:01:22.259> gravity<00:01:22.740> feeding<00:01:23.130> where<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.430> pour<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
its gravity feeding where we pour the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
its gravity feeding where we pour the
mineral<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.860> part<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.220> really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
mineral and I think that part is really

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
mineral and I think that part is really
exciting<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:28.080> every<00:01:28.259> day<00:01:28.380> if

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
exciting because it's not every day if

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
exciting because it's not every day if
we<00:01:28.650> come<00:01:29.070> across<00:01:29.159> liquid<00:01:29.820> metal

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we come across liquid metal

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.899 
we come across liquid metal
so<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.829> applying<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.250> college<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
so when I was applying for college I

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.130 
so when I was applying for college I
also<00:01:33.090> applied<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.720> our<00:01:33.780> sector<00:01:34.110> school<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
also applied for our sector school but I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
also applied for our sector school but I
ended<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.259> coming<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> Carleton

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
ended up coming to Carleton

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
ended up coming to Carleton
if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.660> go<00:01:39.870> into<00:01:40.050> design<00:01:40.410> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.680> know

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
if you just go into design if you know

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
if you just go into design if you know
how<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> make<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.400> model<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:42.000> great<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.510> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
how to make a model that's great but you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
how to make a model that's great but you
also<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:43.140> how<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.320> write<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.980> he<00:01:44.130> needs

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
also know how to write about it he needs

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
also know how to write about it he needs
to<00:01:44.400> know<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> talk<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.560> at

in<00:01:50.310> chemistry<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.060> speaking<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.930> public

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
in chemistry and speaking in public

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.670 
in chemistry and speaking in public
so<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.700> sense<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.840> Carleton<00:01:55.260> gives<00:01:55.470> me

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
so in that sense what Carleton gives me

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.420 
so in that sense what Carleton gives me
is<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.210> preparation<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.250> future

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
is all that preparation for the future

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
is all that preparation for the future
when<00:01:59.940> I<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.479> go<00:02:00.570> into<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.900> real<00:02:01.080> world<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
when I can go into the real world and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.859 
when I can go into the real world and
kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.400> how<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.610> interact<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.360> fellow

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
kind of know how to interact with fellow

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.590 
kind of know how to interact with fellow
designers<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:05.040> potential<00:02:05.550> buyers<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.240> people

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
designers or potential buyers and people

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
designers or potential buyers and people
like<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.520> gonna<00:02:08.670> miss<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
like that so I think I'm gonna miss a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.580 
like that so I think I'm gonna miss a
couple<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.360> things<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.630> Carleton<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.380> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
couple of things about Carleton and the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.020 
couple of things about Carleton and the
first<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.040> can<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
first thing I can think of is just the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
first thing I can think of is just the
studio<00:02:12.390> itself<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.560> has<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
studio itself because it has all the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
studio itself because it has all the
machines<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.730> supplies<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.420> tools<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:16.050> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
machines and supplies and tools that I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410 
machines and supplies and tools that I
need<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.459> gonna<00:02:17.670> miss<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.239> my

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
need and I'm also gonna miss some of my

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.190 
need and I'm also gonna miss some of my
professors<00:02:18.860> Kelly<00:02:19.860> obviously<00:02:20.160> oh<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.330> don't

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
professors Kelly obviously oh I don't

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.140 
professors Kelly obviously oh I don't
know<00:02:22.440> what<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.860> about<00:02:23.310> her<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.970> she's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
know what to do about her because she's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.960 
know what to do about her because she's
given<00:02:24.480> me<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.750> much<00:02:24.930> advice<00:02:25.260> both<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.459> terms<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
given me so much advice both in terms of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.060 
given me so much advice both in terms of
how<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.600> should<00:02:27.840> develop<00:02:28.320> my<00:02:28.410> own<00:02:28.440> aesthetic

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
how I should develop my own aesthetic

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.210 
how I should develop my own aesthetic
sensibility<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> how<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> work<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> studio

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
sensibility and how I work in the studio

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
sensibility and how I work in the studio
but<00:02:32.220> also<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.850> terms<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.270> giving<00:02:33.840> me<00:02:34.110> life

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
but also in terms of giving me life

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.949 
but also in terms of giving me life
advice<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.070> professional<00:02:35.580> advice<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959

think<00:02:37.320> those<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.890> couple<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.220> things<00:02:38.340> on

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
think those are a couple of things on

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:56.960 
think those are a couple of things on
this

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.930
