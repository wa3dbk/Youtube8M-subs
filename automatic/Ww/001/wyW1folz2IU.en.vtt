00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.839 
is Obito gonna know so much about
freakin<00:05:34.780> history<00:05:35.229> between<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.490> Senju<00:05:36.729> clan

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
freakin history between the Senju clan

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.870 
freakin history between the Senju clan
and<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.360> Uchiha<00:05:37.750> clan<00:05:38.130> before<00:05:39.130> Konoha<00:05:39.729> was

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
and the Uchiha clan before Konoha was

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.290 
and the Uchiha clan before Konoha was
even<00:05:40.120> established<00:05:40.690> as<00:05:40.840> shinobi

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
even established as shinobi

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.219 
even established as shinobi
village<00:05:42.639> Toby<00:05:43.639> has<00:05:43.849> to<00:05:44.000> be<00:05:44.090> someone<00:05:44.539> from<00:05:44.569> that

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
village Toby has to be someone from that

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.580 
village Toby has to be someone from that
generation<00:05:45.979> so<00:05:46.569> it's<00:05:47.569> impossible<00:05:47.840> for<00:05:48.139> Obito

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
generation so it's impossible for Obito

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.820 
generation so it's impossible for Obito
to<00:05:48.650> know<00:05:48.860> so<00:05:49.069> much<00:05:49.159> about<00:05:49.220> recruit<00:05:49.729> of<00:05:49.849> singing

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
to know so much about recruit of singing

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.059 
to know so much about recruit of singing
when<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.919> fucking<00:05:52.220> he<00:05:52.490> was<00:05:52.729> under<00:05:52.909> a<00:05:52.940> boulder

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
when you fucking he was under a boulder

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.559 
when you fucking he was under a boulder
for<00:05:55.069> two<00:05:55.220> years

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.110 

reason<00:05:59.569> number<00:05:59.659> eight<00:06:00.669> this<00:06:01.669> is<00:06:01.789> probably<00:06:02.030> the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
reason number eight this is probably the

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.129 
reason number eight this is probably the
biggest<00:06:02.240> reason<00:06:02.479> as<00:06:02.960> to<00:06:03.530> why<00:06:03.759> Toby<00:06:04.759> is<00:06:05.139> like

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
biggest reason as to why Toby is like

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.839 
biggest reason as to why Toby is like
not<00:06:06.740> really<00:06:07.009> Obito

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
not really Obito

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.670 
not really Obito
it's<00:06:08.060> just<00:06:08.330> his<00:06:08.449> body<00:06:09.639> because<00:06:11.349> Nagato<00:06:12.349> is

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
it's just his body because Nagato is

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.879 
it's just his body because Nagato is
much<00:06:13.430> older<00:06:13.909> than<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.150> beetle<00:06:14.469> this<00:06:15.469> is<00:06:15.620> key

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
much older than a beetle this is key

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.480 
much older than a beetle this is key
because<00:06:16.750> Toby<00:06:17.750> told<00:06:18.050> Conan<00:06:18.710> that<00:06:19.099> he<00:06:19.250> gave

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
because Toby told Conan that he gave

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.839 
because Toby told Conan that he gave
Nagato's<00:06:20.060> Rinnegan<00:06:21.370> how<00:06:22.370> would<00:06:22.430> he<00:06:22.610> give

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
Nagato's Rinnegan how would he give

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.219 
Nagato's Rinnegan how would he give
Nagato<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.389> running<00:06:23.750> on

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
Nagato to running on

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.279 
Nagato to running on
if<00:06:24.830> Obito<00:06:25.340> was<00:06:25.759> born<00:06:26.389> after<00:06:26.690> Nagato

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
if Obito was born after Nagato

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.629 
if Obito was born after Nagato
because<00:06:30.289> Obito<00:06:30.860> is<00:06:30.979> much<00:06:31.159> younger<00:06:31.430> than

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
because Obito is much younger than

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.670 
because Obito is much younger than
Nagato

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
Nagato

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.529 
Nagato
so<00:06:33.680> for<00:06:33.889> Toby<00:06:34.190> to<00:06:34.310> give<00:06:34.430> Nagato<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.120> Rinnegan

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
so for Toby to give Nagato the Rinnegan

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.390 
so for Toby to give Nagato the Rinnegan
he<00:06:35.840> has<00:06:35.930> to<00:06:36.050> be<00:06:36.169> older<00:06:36.469> than<00:06:36.500> him<00:06:36.770> so<00:06:37.039> it<00:06:37.129> has<00:06:37.280> to

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
he has to be older than him so it has to

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.640 
he has to be older than him so it has to
be<00:06:37.520> someone<00:06:37.759> before<00:06:38.180> I'll<00:06:38.569> beat<00:06:38.719> oh<00:06:41.650> yeah

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
be someone before I'll beat oh yeah

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.529 
be someone before I'll beat oh yeah
that's<00:06:42.889> pretty<00:06:43.009> much<00:06:43.129> it<00:06:43.250> my<00:06:43.759> reasons<00:06:44.210> as<00:06:44.479> to

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
that's pretty much it my reasons as to

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.100 
that's pretty much it my reasons as to
why<00:06:45.400> Toby<00:06:46.400> is<00:06:46.550> not<00:06:46.729> really<00:06:47.120> Obito<00:06:47.539> it's<00:06:47.840> just

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
why Toby is not really Obito it's just

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.010 
why Toby is not really Obito it's just
these<00:06:48.259> party<00:06:48.650> or<00:06:48.800> something<00:06:49.659> it<00:06:50.659> just<00:06:50.870> looks

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
these party or something it just looks

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.110 
these party or something it just looks
like<00:06:51.080> it's<00:06:51.289> a<00:06:51.349> tomb<00:06:51.590> we<00:06:51.949> seen<00:06:52.130> Toby<00:06:52.550> get<00:06:53.000> his

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
like it's a tomb we seen Toby get his

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.089 
like it's a tomb we seen Toby get his
arm<00:06:53.330> blown<00:06:53.479> off<00:06:53.690> a<00:06:53.870> few<00:06:54.050> times<00:06:54.259> and<00:06:54.500> it<00:06:54.620> turns

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
arm blown off a few times and it turns

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.230 
arm blown off a few times and it turns
it<00:06:55.279> like<00:06:55.430> something<00:06:55.729> that's<00:06:55.819> you<00:06:56.029> like

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
it like something that's you like

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.719 
it like something that's you like
substance<00:06:56.800> so<00:06:57.800> it's<00:06:57.919> probably<00:06:58.190> just<00:06:58.310> said<00:06:58.550> to

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
substance so it's probably just said to

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.420 
substance so it's probably just said to
be<00:06:58.849> using<00:06:59.180> his<00:06:59.300> body<00:06:59.479> and<00:07:00.020> some<00:07:00.919> others<00:07:01.190> some

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
be using his body and some others some

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.100 
be using his body and some others some
other<00:07:01.610> person<00:07:01.969> is<00:07:02.060> all<00:07:02.240> in<00:07:02.419> there<00:07:02.630> like<00:07:02.840> Madara

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
other person is all in there like Madara

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.450 
other person is all in there like Madara
or<00:07:03.500> someone<00:07:05.169> because<00:07:06.169> if<00:07:06.349> it<00:07:06.469> really<00:07:06.710> is<00:07:07.039> Obito

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
or someone because if it really is Obito

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.760 
or someone because if it really is Obito
then<00:07:08.389> timeline<00:07:08.900> wise<00:07:09.020> it<00:07:09.289> doesn't<00:07:09.529> make<00:07:09.620> any

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
then timeline wise it doesn't make any

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.180 
then timeline wise it doesn't make any
sense<00:07:10.900> and<00:07:11.900> in<00:07:12.020> case<00:07:12.199> you<00:07:12.349> just<00:07:12.500> screwed<00:07:13.069> this

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
sense and in case you just screwed this

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.390 
sense and in case you just screwed this
whole<00:07:13.250> story<00:07:13.729> over<00:07:14.000> right<00:07:14.180> there<00:07:15.069> anyway<00:07:16.069> I'm
