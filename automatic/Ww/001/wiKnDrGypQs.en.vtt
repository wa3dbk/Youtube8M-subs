00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello UTB cynic notes and today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.069
 we'll talk about whether you like 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.469
 guys gap between the teeth well, of course u 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 girls because about your crack 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.440
 the guy is unlikely to think day and night 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.939
 Well, in principle, of course guys like 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.460
 whether the girl has more but not between the teeth 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.400
 if to speak somehow ugly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.220
 it turned out okay, you all remember 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 speak so frankly that at all 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 it's disgusting this is vanessa by the way 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.480
 parade yes yes recently they divorced 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.730
 johnny depp and before that enough 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 long lived happily ever after them there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.559
 whether their children were receiving husband relatives are not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 I know I'm not interested in someone elseâ€™s personal life 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.870
 Well, as you can see here, in principle, and the gap 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.050
 between the teeth for a girl is not a sentence 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 well because vanessa is a parade table and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.079
 actress and singer and wife jenny johnny 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 depot and I assure you they have not developed 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.510
 because she had a gap between her teeth 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.210
 not at all therefore in principle of course 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 ok you can live with her another thing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.610
 I am surprised by girls who seriously 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.979
 interested in yandex with google 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.830
 do guys like the gap between the teeth well 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.200
 girls in you are some strange you yourself 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.110
 think how the gap between the teeth can 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.290
 like it what is it so well 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 Madonna, by the way, too, the slit yes but we are 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 love madonna not for this allen let's say u 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 Alla Borisovna Pugacheva 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.799
 in her youth when she still had her 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 teeth are not as false as it is now and their 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.490
 family too was a gap well excuse me 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 she sang wonderful songs 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 excellent voice so if you 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.850
 think that madonna Pugacheva or Vanessa 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.460
 people love paradis because of the gap 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.610
 between the teeth of a girl I hurry you 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.899
 upset no not because of this just like that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 lip gap 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.810
 no one will love no front not on 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.210
 front teeth of us here these two incisors are not 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.290
 there if you have all your teeth still rare 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.530
 know how to fence 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.560
 rare curves with large such members 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.600
 no one will love this naturally and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 married because and the gap between the teeth is not 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.910
 will call but from the other side and such 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 whistler as they say yes like a singer 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 Nikolay rastorgueva 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.560
 he is not some such know not 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.020
 branded what they say I'm girls cleft 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.900
 need to do something to knock it out 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.870
 mothers I let shamkay false teeth 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.459
 otherwise no one will marry her 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.590
 meets with her no no well 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.440
 of course everything will be fine 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.090
 you do not dwell heavily but in general 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.390
 by the way in the comments just in case 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.700
 write how you came to mind 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 such an idea that the gap between the teeth can 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.590
 like it because i like 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.870
 periodically comes to the block and ask 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.709
 It is this question cast there are such 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.590
 I do not know the search in some sort of instilled 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.510
 girls but you are not adequate 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.940
 like the crack but not so much of course 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.670
 to burn you like see on fire in 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.489
 Middle Ages but certainly better without a gap 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.019
 it is much better but subscribe 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.579
 put a finger on my channel top and 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.579
 put braces or something
