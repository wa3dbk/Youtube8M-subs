they think what they needed just like
Seinfeld<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:15.240> think<00:05:15.630> what<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> think<00:05:15.990> what's

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320

going<00:05:16.470> on<00:05:16.680> here<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:16.980> think<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.370> they<00:05:17.490> just<00:05:17.850> got

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
going on here I think that they just got

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.220 
going on here I think that they just got
sick<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.330> tired<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.630> all<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> attacks<00:05:19.080> on

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
sick and tired of all the attacks on

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.790 
sick and tired of all the attacks on
Sarah<00:05:19.470> Palin

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
Sarah Palin

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.960 
Sarah Palin
I<00:05:19.860> would<00:05:20.190> say<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.520> there<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.790> more<00:05:20.940> the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
I would say that there the more the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.150 
I would say that there the more the
Democrats<00:05:21.419> attack<00:05:21.690> Sarah<00:05:22.169> Palin<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.770> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
Democrats attack Sarah Palin the the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.430 
Democrats attack Sarah Palin the the
worse<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.669> is<00:05:23.730> for<00:05:23.790> them<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:25.020> they<00:05:25.140> need<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.350> be

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
worse it is for them and they need to be

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.460 
worse it is for them and they need to be
careful<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:27.150> think<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:27.900> they<00:05:28.020> everyone<00:05:28.290> needs

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470
