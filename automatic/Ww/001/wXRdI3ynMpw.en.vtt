for black America neuro bhama because

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a better job and I don't think a lot of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.270 
a better job and I don't think a lot of
people<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.640> convinced<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.600> yet<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
people are convinced of that just yet I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.860 
people are convinced of that just yet I
think<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> Romney's<00:00:47.910> decision<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> speak<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
think that Romney's decision to speak to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
think that Romney's decision to speak to
the<00:00:48.960> black<00:00:49.110> community<00:00:49.289> however<00:00:49.829> was

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the black community however was

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
the black community however was
incredibly<00:00:51.300> bold<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
incredibly bold I think that it it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
incredibly bold I think that it it
certainly<00:00:53.760> raises<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.480> bar<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> little<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.350> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
certainly raises the bar a little bit in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
certainly raises the bar a little bit in
terms<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> making<00:00:56.219> black<00:00:56.579> boulders<00:00:56.969> feel<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
terms of making black boulders feel that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
terms of making black boulders feel that
there<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.530> home<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there could be a home for them in the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
there could be a home for them in the
Republican<00:00:59.699> Party<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
Republican Party because one of the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
Republican Party because one of the
biggest<00:01:01.140> secrets<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.859> black<00:01:02.399> America<00:01:02.550> right

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
biggest secrets in black America right

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
biggest secrets in black America right
now<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.470> millions<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> African

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
now is that you have millions of African

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
now is that you have millions of African
Americans<00:01:05.700> who<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.030> looking<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.390> solutions

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Americans who are looking for solutions

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
Americans who are looking for solutions
many<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.159> conservative<00:01:08.790> values

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
many of them have conservative values

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.160 
many of them have conservative values
that<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.869> home<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that would be right at home in the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
that would be right at home in the
republican<00:01:10.619> party<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.430> don't

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
republican party but they just don't

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
republican party but they just don't
feel<00:01:11.909> welcome<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> Romney<00:01:13.170> made

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
feel welcome so I think the Romney made

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
feel welcome so I think the Romney made
a<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.500> move<00:01:13.560> by<00:01:13.740> standing<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> black<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a good move by standing to the black so

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.940 
a good move by standing to the black so
we<00:01:15.060> made<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.689> move<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.590> initial

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we made a good move back to my initial

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
we made a good move back to my initial
question<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.490> life<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.850> worse<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.420> for

Romney<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.239> think<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.959> would<00:02:40.019> be<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.170> bad

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
Romney I think that would be a bad

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.680 
Romney I think that would be a bad
assumption<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.190> well<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.970> okay<00:02:42.239> okay<00:02:42.540> he

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
assumption as well it's okay okay he

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.360 
assumption as well it's okay okay he
could<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:43.200> some<00:02:43.380> points<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:43.980> poor<00:02:44.250> his

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
could get some points for poor his

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.949 
could get some points for poor his
stance<00:02:44.579> on<00:02:44.760> traditional<00:02:45.180> marriage<00:02:45.540> perhaps

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
stance on traditional marriage perhaps

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.390 
stance on traditional marriage perhaps

is very real the energy this is really
my<00:06:28.419> final<00:06:28.690> thought<00:06:28.840> for<00:06:29.050> you<00:06:29.169> you<00:06:29.289> know<00:06:29.380> when

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
energy the enthusiasm is so so pervasive

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.600 
energy the enthusiasm is so so pervasive
and<00:06:34.030> it's<00:06:34.600> so<00:06:34.810> lacking<00:06:35.380> it's<00:06:35.650> so<00:06:35.919> lacking<00:06:36.460> this

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610

that's<00:06:58.419> going<00:06:58.630> to<00:06:58.720> happen<00:06:58.870> but<00:06:59.560> I<00:06:59.590> do<00:06:59.710> think

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
that's going to happen but I do think

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.080 
that's going to happen but I do think
that<00:07:00.160> what<00:07:00.490> you<00:07:00.610> have<00:07:00.789> in<00:07:00.910> the<00:07:00.970> black

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
that what you have in the black

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.730 
that what you have in the black
community<00:07:01.270> is<00:07:01.660> you<00:07:01.780> have<00:07:01.900> a<00:07:01.930> lot<00:07:02.229> of<00:07:02.259> political

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
orphans you have people that don't feel

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.260 
orphans you have people that don't feel
a<00:07:05.440> love<00:07:05.949> or<00:07:06.070> loyalty<00:07:06.190> for<00:07:06.550> either<00:07:06.699> party<00:07:07.000> they

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
a love or loyalty for either party they

parties<00:07:08.860> and<00:07:09.160> i<00:07:09.520> think<00:07:09.789> that<00:07:09.880> the<00:07:09.940> black<00:07:10.150> vote

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389
