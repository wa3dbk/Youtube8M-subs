about how lucky we are as photographers

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.490 
about how lucky we are as photographers
when<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> travel<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.269> spectacular

when we get to travel to spectacular

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
when we get to travel to spectacular
landscapes<00:00:28.730> being<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.880> there<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.119> feeling

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
landscapes being out there and feeling

landscapes being out there and feeling
connected<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> place<00:00:31.769> through<00:00:32.340> photography

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
connected to a place through photography

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
connected to a place through photography
is<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.300> fuels<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.930> creativity<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
is what fuels my creativity and that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
is what fuels my creativity and that
connection<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> subject<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
connection with the subject is what I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.750 
connection with the subject is what I
believe<00:00:37.350> leads<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.160> better<00:00:38.250> images

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
the forecast the sunset probably won't

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.370 
the forecast the sunset probably won't
be<00:01:36.830> very<00:01:36.979> interesting<00:01:37.660> but<00:01:38.660> we're<00:01:38.810> excited<00:01:39.110> at

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
be very interesting but we're excited at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.960 
be very interesting but we're excited at
the<00:01:39.470> possibility<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:40.160> photographing<00:01:40.850> the

unfortunately the Steen's mountain range

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.050 
unfortunately the Steen's mountain range
isn't<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.590> ideal<00:01:46.009> foreground<00:01:46.580> for<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.850> star

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
isn't the ideal foreground for the star

isn't the ideal foreground for the star
photo<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.390> want<00:01:47.690> because<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.590> generally<00:01:48.830> shoot

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
photo I want because you generally shoot

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.370 
photo I want because you generally shoot
stars<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:49.940> wide<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.270> mountains<00:01:50.959> don't<00:01:51.170> look
