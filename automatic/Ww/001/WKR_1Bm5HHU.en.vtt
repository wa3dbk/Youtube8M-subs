 finally how are you my little ones 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.570
 guardians welcome to a new video 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.150
 of destiny and I have prepared this video 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.669
 to share certain things with 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.130
 you to see what it is that we 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.859
 let's find on the reef all 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.949
 the possibilities that he will offer us and 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.320
 well in fact it's going to be point one of 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.440
 the points with together with the tower that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.750
 more we will be visiting in our 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.850
 favorite game in destination so nothing 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.820
 As you can see, the ad opens here 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.269
 from the house of the wolves and then right away 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.949
 we take our ship we go to the map 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.589
 of navigation this map since we 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.809
 It is so familiar but not so much in the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.190
 part in the north you already know that there 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.900
 is where we have this new area in this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.309
 good decoration in this in this design 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.290
 that also attracts my attention 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.199
 so nothing we're going to go to the post of 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.060

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.689
 we are in the position of vesta and what 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 first we have to do then 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.000
 Logically it is a must see 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 go talk to our 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 Advise with our friend Petra come to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.980

 perfect that we want people new people 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.470
 new there are interesting characters that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.360
 give us a lot of work and many 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.990
 rewards good as you see the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.799
 aesthetic aspect of the menus in the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 characters has changed slightly and that 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.229
 thank you and on the other hand you are going to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 go see that each character with whom 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.130
 let's talk about being the first time we're going 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.780
 to give some reward that is going to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.430
 come very well well then in the moment 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.890
 that I'm recording this had already 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.509
 completed the main campaign to 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 I've been recording quite a few things for 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.910

 do no spoilers but I love you 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:19.040
 anticipate that the campaign is short but 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 intense there is especially good part of the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.340
 new assault there is a mission that has 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.209
 called a lot of attention and that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.530
 all those who have played it or the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.780
 go play if what 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.730
 so you're going to like it and it's going to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.750
 surprise I'm sure so nothing 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.910
 well I do not want to say anything else to the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.530
 respect because if not then everything is known 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.360
 well let's go talk now with 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.570
 barix 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.870
 barix the four arms two plus two that 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.480
 you already know two integers and two good ones 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.540
 that way as you see has enough 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.090
 things to offer us I see that these 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.670
 crusher gloves surely then 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.500
 they will be changing every week and so 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.790
 well we have this week better said 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.800
 we have the gloves next week 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.270
 surely we will have something else and with 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.510
 weapon then three quarters of what 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.680
 same we have is good is new in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.320
 new material the probability of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.330
 judgment that has called me well enough 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.490
 attention the truth is one thing that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.290
 you say good to see and see what it is 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.330
 you can do with this exactly good 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.709
 As you can also see what bands are 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.080
 take the sorcerer because he gives me the option 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.180
 of getting certain bands we have what 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.580
 typical and recharges both special and 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.709
 heavy and then what are the ships that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.510
 They have to be the truth, well, 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.940
 chulas not want to give it now 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.040
 neither will we reveal anything of the other 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.440
 but hey world here everyone as 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.940
 do not take a look at it and then 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.940
 Well of your opinion 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.100
 it's funny that he asks us about the ship 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.550
 because he does not know any place here 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.900
 to leave the ships so in the end that 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.880
 is one of the issues that already 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.200
 let's talk later there are certain of matteo 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.270
 have to prepare a video to tell you about 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.550
 one thing about destiny that I hope you 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.250
 I like it and call the good care 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.140
 soon soon you are going to go to 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.459
 know good because as you can see we have been 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.520
 speaking here with the crypt that now 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.060
 same looks like a relative of the teacher 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.040
 raul are practically nailed just 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.079
 that the other has that hood and good 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.910
 Well, here our new friend, not the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.740
 you see it does not take it good we have here to the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
 administrator also that gives us a 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.960
 good object because this object lost 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.000
 good if we have here the emblem this 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.460
 new emblem that the truth that is 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.630
 Pretty cool, I like it a lot 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.970
 because red is a color that I like 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.750
 pretty and good as it combines combines 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.669
 well you have your own personal touch is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.500
 this emblem good as you see here 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.200
 we also have the deposits that give 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.180
 right between the robot of the contracts and 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.380
 the administrator here we have them for 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.740
 manage all of our 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.560
 and equipment 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.479
 It's already perfect, well, well, nothing 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.889
 I said, we're going to talk 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.259
 now with the brother they will see what has 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.889
 for us you see that he is marking there 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.889
 the exclamation point 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.849
 very good, because here he offers us our 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.909
 reward 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.339
 perfect we also good three units 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.349
 of currency of the passage you already know that this 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:24.740
 element will be used for 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.409
 get good certain passes and certain 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.949
 things that are good for us are going to 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:34.699
 come very well to get materials 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.099
 exclusive of osiris you already know that it has 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.929
 Well, certain certain armor 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.509
 equipment that will be exclusive to 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:43.759
 this way in the good multiplayer 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.949
 Well, as you can see here, this toga offers us 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.490
 of the exiled the truth that good has 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:52.219
 that Egyptian touch everything that surrounds 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.339
 Osiris and that gives you at that point 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:57.409
 also of distinction regarding everything 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.050
 that we have been getting up to 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.399
 right now good perfect because we have 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.319
 here a pass of certain advantages that we 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.099
 will offer let's take a look by 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.369
 this side 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:10.099
 this is where we found a couple of 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:12.589
 doors that attract attention but not 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.599
 do not worry because you bungee in one of 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.639
 the streamings he made a few days ago 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.439
 talking about the reef and certain 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.569
 elements that we would find here 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.539
 Well, they've already told us that these 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:27.139
 will serve for the future of the efes where 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.449
 then we can access and meet with 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.979
 surely new and new characters 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.979
 Perfect areas 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.430
 this robot is a bit here is a 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.040
 little cornered I thought maybe maybe 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.210
 would give us some clue some detail 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.340
 but well you see that no 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.250
 they are simply there taking care of 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.560
 keep the area good, we need 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.840
 visiting a last area we need 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.370
 visit the personal guard of the 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.550
 queen that we find her right in this 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.620
 point and good as you see the door is 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.330
 closed since this zone then only 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.340
 will enable it at the moment 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.199
 we need to do some kind of events 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.449
 good special because this is what 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.639
 I wanted to share with all of you the 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.770
 first steps through the reef everything 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.630
 that you can offer us so far and 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.270

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.880
 otherwise you think you will not want 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.979
 get away from the tower
