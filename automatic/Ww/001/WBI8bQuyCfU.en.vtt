00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
base and this was before we had this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
base and this was before we had this
village<00:00:46.379> edit<00:00:46.680> mode<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.070> clan<00:00:47.309> wars<00:00:47.550> where<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
village edit mode in clan wars where you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
village edit mode in clan wars where you
had<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> same<00:00:48.660> base<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.379> regular<00:00:49.680> base

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
had the same base for your regular base

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.580 
had the same base for your regular base
and<00:00:50.160> clan<00:00:50.370> wars<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.020> made<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.350> base

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and clan wars so I just made this base

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639 
and clan wars so I just made this base
really<00:00:53.190> quick<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.660> main<00:00:54.840> focus<00:00:55.110> always

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
really quick but my main focus always

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
really quick but my main focus always
for<00:00:55.829> making<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> hog<00:00:56.340> rider<00:00:56.579> base<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
for making a hog rider base and it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610 
for making a hog rider base and it
should<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.420> yours<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> making<00:00:58.469> your

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
should be yours as well is making your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
should be yours as well is making your
clan<00:00:58.890> castle<00:00:59.160> extremely<00:01:00.090> hard<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
clan castle extremely hard to get to and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.100 
clan castle extremely hard to get to and
your<00:01:01.469> heroes<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.980> well<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.690> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
your heroes as well but I think it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
your heroes as well but I think it's
more<00:01:04.320> important<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> clan<00:01:05.369> castle<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
more important for the clan castle so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
more important for the clan castle so
you<00:01:06.360> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.960> directly<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you want to put that it directly in the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
you want to put that it directly in the
middle<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.400> base<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.140> want

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
with the hog rider attack or get your

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
with the hog rider attack or get your
clan<00:01:41.970> castle<00:01:42.180> troops<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> hot<00:01:43.259> greater

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
clan castle troops with the hot greater

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.880 
clan castle troops with the hot greater
tag<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.970> lot<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.360> people<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
tag so a lot of people will think that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
tag so a lot of people will think that
will<00:01:47.670> they'll<00:01:47.850> drop<00:01:48.060> their<00:01:48.240> hog<00:01:48.420> riders<00:01:48.810> think

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
will they'll drop their hog riders think

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
will they'll drop their hog riders think
that<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:50.009> say<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.280> dropped<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:50.880> top

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that like say they dropped it on my top

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
that like say they dropped it on my top
right<00:01:51.540> Archer<00:01:51.930> tower<00:01:52.140> by<00:01:52.770> my<00:01:53.009> research

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
right Archer tower by my research

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
right Archer tower by my research
factory<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.439> they<00:01:55.439> didn't<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.740> any<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> my

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
factory and they didn't get any of my

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
factory and they didn't get any of my
clan<00:01:56.430> castle<00:01:56.640> troops<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.149> come<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> lot<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
clan castle troops to come out a lot of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560 
clan castle troops to come out a lot of
people<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.880> there<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.299> maybe<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
people think that there then maybe I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
people think that there then maybe I
don't<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.020> any<00:02:01.170> client<00:02:01.469> castle<00:02:01.829> troops<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
don't have any client castle troops and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
don't have any client castle troops and
just<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> attack<00:02:03.509> take<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.079> my

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
just go for the attack take out my

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
just go for the attack take out my
heroes<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.790> attack

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
heroes and then just go for the attack

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.869 
heroes and then just go for the attack
and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.509> while<00:02:07.340> while<00:02:08.340> they're<00:02:08.550> dropping

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and then while while they're dropping

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.520 
and then while while they're dropping
all<00:02:09.030> their<00:02:09.209> hog<00:02:09.360> riders<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.379> get

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
all their hog riders and they get

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
all their hog riders and they get
farther<00:02:10.739> into<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> base<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.580> realize<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
farther into the base they realize I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.580 
farther into the base they realize I
have<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
have a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.979 
have a
your<00:02:12.860> clan<00:02:13.069> castle<00:02:13.310> troops<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.480> will<00:02:14.720> take

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
your clan castle troops and it will take

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.530 
your clan castle troops and it will take
out<00:02:15.400> their<00:02:16.400> client<00:02:16.790> or<00:02:16.910> their<00:02:17.060> hog<00:02:17.209> riders

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
out their client or their hog riders

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.270 
out their client or their hog riders
fairly<00:02:17.900> quickly<00:02:18.110> five<00:02:18.440> wizards<00:02:18.709> or<00:02:19.010> something

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
fairly quickly five wizards or something

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.520 
fairly quickly five wizards or something
in<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.550> but<00:02:20.239> yeah<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.569> that's<00:02:20.750> mainly<00:02:20.989> how

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
in there but yeah so that's mainly how

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470 
in there but yeah so that's mainly how
you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.830> make<00:02:21.950> any<00:02:22.250> clan<00:02:22.550> castle<00:02:22.790> base<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you can make any clan castle base and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720 
you can make any clan castle base and
then<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.140> centralized<00:02:24.830> my<00:02:25.069> air<00:02:25.250> defenses

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
then I just centralized my air defenses

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
then I just centralized my air defenses
because<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> lot<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> Hydra<00:02:26.989> bases<00:02:27.319> are<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.650> of

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
because a lot of Hydra bases are kind of

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.180 
because a lot of Hydra bases are kind of
weaker<00:02:28.069> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.690> air<00:02:29.690> defense<00:02:30.049> side<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.680> then

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
weaker on the air defense side and then

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.080 
weaker on the air defense side and then
I<00:02:31.610> know<00:02:31.790> how<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.269> have<00:02:32.510> my<00:02:32.769> hiya<00:02:33.769> expose<00:02:34.580> kind<00:02:34.940> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
I know how I have my hiya expose kind of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.080 
I know how I have my hiya expose kind of
lopsided<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:36.319> but<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.849> threw

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
lopsided there but I just kind of threw

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.369 
lopsided there but I just kind of threw
him<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.269> there<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.140> bottom

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
him in there you can see on the bottom

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.650 
him in there you can see on the bottom
of<00:02:39.830> my<00:02:40.069> base<00:02:40.280> i<00:02:40.489> have<00:02:40.580> my<00:02:40.700> dark<00:02:40.910> elixir<00:02:41.120> storage

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
of my base i have my dark elixir storage

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.800 
of my base i have my dark elixir storage
thats<00:02:42.500> i<00:02:43.310> don't<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.180> i<00:02:44.239> just<00:02:44.330> kind<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.630> threw

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
thats i don't know i just kind of threw

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.270 
thats i don't know i just kind of threw
it<00:02:44.930> out<00:02:45.019> there<00:02:45.170> when<00:02:45.319> i<00:02:45.349> got<00:02:45.530> my<00:02:45.560> expo<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
it out there when i got my expo and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.580 
it out there when i got my expo and
really<00:02:46.790> even<00:02:46.910> change<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.299> but<00:02:47.959> yeah<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.470> it's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
really even change it but yeah so it's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.370 
really even change it but yeah so it's
this<00:02:49.549> base<00:02:49.760> works<00:02:50.090> pretty<00:02:50.239> well<00:02:50.360> really<00:02:51.140> no

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
this base works pretty well really no

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.900 
this base works pretty well really no
one<00:02:51.470> attacks<00:02:51.829> me<00:02:52.040> anymore<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.430> clan<00:02:52.640> wars

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
one attacks me anymore in clan wars

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.890 
one attacks me anymore in clan wars
because<00:02:53.150> i<00:02:53.299> have<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.660> inferno<00:02:54.620> towers<00:02:54.799> on

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
because i have the inferno towers on

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.420 
because i have the inferno towers on
whatever<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.379> multiple<00:02:57.769> targets<00:02:58.220> so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
whatever is the multiple targets so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.949 
whatever is the multiple targets so
that's<00:02:58.640> really<00:02:58.910> hard<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.239> get<00:02:59.329> over<00:02:59.420> with<00:02:59.690> hogs

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
that's really hard to get over with hogs

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.220 
that's really hard to get over with hogs
and<00:03:00.319> my<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.549> with<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> combination<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:02.930> clan

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
and my and with a combination of my clan

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.610 
and my and with a combination of my clan
castle<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.680> extremely<00:03:04.220> hard<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.519> trigger<00:03:05.620> so

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
castle is extremely hard to trigger so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.420 
castle is extremely hard to trigger so
that's<00:03:07.519> just<00:03:07.849> basically<00:03:08.750> how<00:03:09.019> any<00:03:09.290> any<00:03:10.190> good

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that's just basically how any any good

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.400 
that's just basically how any any good
hog<00:03:10.640> rider<00:03:10.849> base<00:03:11.090> would<00:03:11.329> be<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:12.079> then<00:03:12.260> i<00:03:12.290> have

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
hog rider base would be and then i have

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.470 
hog rider base would be and then i have
my<00:03:12.620> i<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:13.400> just<00:03:13.489> explain<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.090> little<00:03:14.120> more<00:03:14.420> i

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
my i can just explain it a little more i

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.770 
my i can just explain it a little more i
have<00:03:14.840> my<00:03:15.079> wizard<00:03:15.680> towers<00:03:16.420> spread<00:03:17.420> out<00:03:17.510> through

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
have my wizard towers spread out through

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.870 
have my wizard towers spread out through
the<00:03:17.900> base<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.440> then<00:03:18.560> my<00:03:18.709> giant<00:03:19.160> bombs<00:03:19.370> i<00:03:19.700> have

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the base and then my giant bombs i have

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.809 
the base and then my giant bombs i have
in<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.120> inner<00:03:20.450> workings<00:03:21.319> of<00:03:21.709> my<00:03:21.769> base<00:03:22.100> where<00:03:22.790> a

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
in the inner workings of my base where a
