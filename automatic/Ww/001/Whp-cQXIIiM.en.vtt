create an external switch what that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
create an external switch what that
means<00:00:58.769> is<00:00:59.069> my<00:00:59.460> virtual<00:00:59.879> machines<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
means is my virtual machines will be

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.000 
means is my virtual machines will be
able<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.929> communicate<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> external

this<00:01:19.380> exercise<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> pick<00:01:20.550> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this exercise I'm going to pick the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.220 
this exercise I'm going to pick the
Wi-Fi<00:01:21.270> neck<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.490> select<00:01:23.490> ok<00:01:24.500> yes

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.270 

and<00:01:33.020> that's<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.200> i<00:01:34.230> have<00:01:34.500> created<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.160> virtual

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and that's it i have created a virtual

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.660 
and that's it i have created a virtual
switch<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:38.010> created<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.550> virtual

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
switch so we just created a virtual

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
switch so we just created a virtual
switch<00:01:39.150> let's<00:01:39.690> create<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> virtual<00:01:40.380> machine<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
switch let's create a virtual machine to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.150 
switch let's create a virtual machine to
use<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.310> switch<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> video<00:01:43.620> i'm<00:01:43.980> going

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
use the switch in this video i'm going

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.820 
use the switch in this video i'm going
to<00:01:44.250> create<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.580> virtual<00:01:45.000> machine<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.470> virtual

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
to create a virtual machine the virtual

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.280 
to create a virtual machine the virtual
machine<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.580> empty<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:48.600> will<00:01:48.810> install

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
machine will be empty and i will install

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.980 
machine will be empty and i will install
an<00:01:49.470> operating<00:01:49.590> system<00:01:49.860> using<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.760> iso<00:01:51.180> file<00:01:51.480> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
an operating system using an iso file so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.570 
an operating system using an iso file so
let's<00:01:52.170> start<00:01:52.410> by<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.950> through<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> hyper-v

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
let's start by going through the hyper-v

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.450 
let's start by going through the hyper-v
manager<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.950> creating<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> new<00:01:56.250> virtual

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

dynamic<00:02:07.380> memory<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:09.500> use<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.740> switch<00:02:11.040> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
dynamic memory on it use the switch that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.840 
dynamic memory on it use the switch that
I<00:02:11.310> had<00:02:11.520> created<00:02:12.000> earlier<00:02:13.550> create<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> new

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850
