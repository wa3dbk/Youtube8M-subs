00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello everyone I am in this 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.250
 live moment of the studio puts in I 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.250
 am trying to register a new 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.939
 album that should appear in the month of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.440
 March very quickly March the weekend and it's 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.380
 the studio for me this is one of 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.539
 most exciting moments of the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.990
 creation of the album am always when 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.359
 even impressed to see a tank that 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.780
 we compose that we write the points while 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.400
 alone at home and then finally we 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.970
 arrives in the studio with a guitar a 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.640
 voice 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.580
 and then to the whole process of the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.250
 creation for me that 's what fascinates me from 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.440
 see the judge each instrument is from 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.909
 see what a simple shock was 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.710
 composed at home can become and everything 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.180
 while we are here with each other at 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.150
 rust and I'm the simple little face to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.010
 the grandeur of the work and the impact 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.250
 that single champion each one would have 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.829
 just not register his calves risk 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.590
 that toured around the world by 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.619
 years and years by is enabled 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.760
 life all that gold for me it's really 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.070
 one of the most important moments 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.860
 the project is right now I'm working 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.470
 with an extraordinary team and then 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.980
 we try with this album we want 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.140
 really push even further but 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.870
 music that's a lot of albums that I 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 do but for each album I tell myself that 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.230
 this one is going to be the best but I 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.580
 really think that this one is very likely 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.980
 to be the best 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.280
 otherwise I find that if the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.540
 best I like the direction 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 that it is taking a shot of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.790
 luck obviously his singing 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.150
 of adoration jean adoration but there are 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.850
 really like a sense of destiny in 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 the direction of the texts were not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.450
 departure it was not in the direction that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.120
 I will take it more we do not write anymore I have 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.940
 written that I composed more I feel 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.970
 really it's an album intended for the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 sell two hopes a lot of hope and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.070
 of perseverance to continue before 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.320
 that's what happens high level and 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.850
 my prayer is really that it's expensive 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.430
 that this album is a source 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.489
 inspiration for all people 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.160
 who will listen to it and I really pray 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.230
 that many be part of 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.000
 in the coming years of your 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 assemblies of your celebrations into your 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.780
 churches and I have very very 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.129
 more and hear this new project and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.470
 then here too waters we will do everything 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.510
 for this album and this is the best 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.890
 possible and above all that is a plus 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.200
 great a diction that more rarely 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.959
