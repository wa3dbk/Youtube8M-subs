hi<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.979> solar<00:00:02.399> concentrator<00:00:03.140> made

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi this is my solar concentrator made

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.909 
hi this is my solar concentrator made
with<00:00:04.319> 12<00:00:04.620> watt<00:00:04.799> motor<00:00:04.980> oils<00:00:05.250> here<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.919> they're

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
with 12 watt motor oils here and they're

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.089 
with 12 watt motor oils here and they're
all<00:00:08.269> this<00:00:09.269> vertical<00:00:11.150> translation<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.920> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
all this vertical translation so it is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.029 
all this vertical translation so it is
tracking<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> Sun<00:00:15.000> yeah<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
tracking the Sun yeah so you see the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.480 
tracking the Sun yeah so you see the
focal<00:00:17.550> point<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.010> cold

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
focal point here and that is the cold

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.259 
focal point here and that is the cold
inside<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.410> heater<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.550> hit<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
inside to get the heater and to hit the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.009 
inside to get the heater and to hit the
water<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.859> working<00:00:29.210> its<00:00:30.210> tracking<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
water so it's working its tracking and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.229 
water so it's working its tracking and
the<00:00:31.650> water<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.510> heated<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.170> would<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
the water is heated but I would say a

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.410 
the water is heated but I would say a
bigger<00:00:39.239> dish<00:00:39.710> would<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.760> efficient

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
bigger dish would be more efficient

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
bigger dish would be more efficient
maybe<00:00:43.140> twelve<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> size<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:46.579> would

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
maybe twelve the size of this one would

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.979 
maybe twelve the size of this one would
be<00:00:48.260> large<00:00:49.260> enough<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.719> hot

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
be large enough for sure to have hot

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
be large enough for sure to have hot
water<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:55.219> further<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:59.460> tracker<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:01.640> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
water for further and this tracker is is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.719 
water for further and this tracker is is
working<00:01:02.910> well<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:05.150> I'm<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.729> show

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
working well too so I'm going to show

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:43.060 
working well too so I'm going to show
the<00:01:09.030> system<00:01:09.860> tracking<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> while

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.440 

the<00:01:43.610> pipe<00:01:43.850> here<00:01:44.470> should<00:01:45.470> be<00:01:45.590> directed<00:01:46.210> in<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the pipe here should be directed in the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:02:09.430 
the pipe here should be directed in the
middle

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.760 

so<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:10.370> you<00:02:10.490> make<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.790> system<00:02:10.970> yourself

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
so if you make this system yourself

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.120 
so if you make this system yourself
would<00:02:12.770> cost<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.370> maybe<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:15.230> Android<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.860> found

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
would cost you maybe to Android to found

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.990 
would cost you maybe to Android to found
what<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> join<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.690> join<00:02:17.720> dollars<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
what can I join you can join dollars so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:40.730 
what can I join you can join dollars so
it<00:02:23.000> was<00:02:24.100> time<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.490> forced<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> make<00:02:26.240> it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.660 

but<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> bigger<00:02:41.970> dish<00:02:43.310> because<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.490> one

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
but with a bigger dish because this one

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.240 
but with a bigger dish because this one
is<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.150> perfectly<00:02:45.570> adjusted<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> very

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
is to be perfectly adjusted to a very

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.170 
is to be perfectly adjusted to a very
hot<00:02:47.460> water

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.840 

okay<00:02:57.209> thanks<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.299> watching
