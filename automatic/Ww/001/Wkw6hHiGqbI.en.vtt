00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
have to undo the electrical connection

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
have to undo the electrical connection
or<00:00:47.610> fight<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> box<00:00:48.829> then<00:00:49.829> you're

or fight it off the box then you're
going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> come<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:51.440> disconnect<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
going to come up here disconnect the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.630 
going to come up here disconnect the
electrical<00:00:53.780> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> front<00:00:55.199> corner

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640

but on the front you'll take out those

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.190 
but on the front you'll take out those
two<00:01:08.830> 5/16<00:01:09.830> there<00:01:10.820> will<00:01:10.909> be<00:01:10.939> a<00:01:11.000> 5/16<00:01:11.990> on<00:01:12.110> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
two 5/16 there will be a 5/16 on the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
a bracket goes into the intake you want

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.609 
a bracket goes into the intake you want
to<00:01:15.920> take<00:01:16.040> out<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:16.420> 5/16<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.259> want<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.500> take

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619

back side and your exhaust tube on the
back<00:01:45.200> see<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:45.740> I'm<00:01:45.890> going<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.100> show<00:01:46.399> that

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
back see if I'm going to show that

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.969 
back see if I'm going to show that
there's<00:01:46.909> two<00:01:47.090> 5/16<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.140> hold<00:01:48.319> this<00:01:48.440> bracket<00:01:48.890> on

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
there's two 5/16 to hold this bracket on

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.649 
there's two 5/16 to hold this bracket on
the<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.250> time<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.610> got<00:01:49.819> that<00:01:50.000> loose<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.509> then

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
the one time you got that loose and then

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.930 
the one time you got that loose and then
take<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.110> hose<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.709> wiggle<00:01:51.860> around<00:01:52.069> no

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
take the hose and just wiggle around no

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.419 
take the hose and just wiggle around no
problem<00:01:53.409> now<00:01:54.409> one<00:01:54.560> time<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.890> get<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
problem now one time you get to that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.340 
problem now one time you get to that
stage<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:56.299> should<00:01:56.330> be<00:01:56.690> able<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.899> just<00:01:57.110> pick<00:01:57.289> up

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
stage you should be able to just pick up

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.410 
stage you should be able to just pick up
and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.100> take<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.429> should<00:01:58.729> be<00:01:58.819> fairly<00:01:59.090> loose

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and then take it should be fairly loose

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.330 
and then take it should be fairly loose
like<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.740> want<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.979> pick<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.250> up

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
like that you want to pick it up

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.969 
like that you want to pick it up
directly<00:02:01.610> over<00:02:02.030> top<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.569> then<00:02:02.690> brackets<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
directly over top and then brackets and

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.100 
directly over top and then brackets and
rest<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.459> up<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.880> usually<00:02:05.420> stick<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.810> screwdriver

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
rest it up I usually stick a screwdriver

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.109 
rest it up I usually stick a screwdriver
or<00:02:06.530> something<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.220> valve<00:02:07.459> cover<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.880> hold

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
or something on the valve cover and hold

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.050 
or something on the valve cover and hold
up<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.479> intake<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.519> get<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.759> there<00:02:10.910> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
up the intake so I can get in there to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.920 
up the intake so I can get in there to
get<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.299> these<00:02:11.450> front<00:02:11.780> three<00:02:12.019> spark<00:02:12.350> plugs<00:02:13.930> now

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
get to these front three spark plugs now

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.360 
get to these front three spark plugs now
one<00:02:15.109> time<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.410> get<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.799> stage<00:02:16.070> you'll

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
one time you get to this stage you'll

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.479 
one time you get to this stage you'll
take<00:02:16.579> a<00:02:16.609> t20<00:02:17.299> star<00:02:18.049> socket<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:18.709> hex<00:02:18.890> socket<00:02:19.130> and
