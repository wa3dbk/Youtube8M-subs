00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.020
 and this tells the muse one more 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.969
 I went on my facebook in the middle is 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.500
 I asked you guys what you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.340
 wanted to watch in today's video and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 Someone commented how it was decided 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 when I was shopping for makeup 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.710
 first time 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 so that inspired me to make a video 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.179
 about prejudice in the family that I know 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 what a sad thing that Brazil 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.120
 now faces the following self 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 I'm very lucky because I was born in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 crazy family 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 no one has any morals or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.149
 Consciousness says it only beats crazy people 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 and that each with its madness and that's it 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 then we follow life then inside the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 my family thanks anyway 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 personal to what is a lot that is crazy 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.059
 for other families here is simply 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.100
 day to day but it's obvious that when I 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 I started wearing shorts pointed out that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 people is not that they were surprised at what 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.070
 Like, I never asked. I just understood. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.210
 I only started wearing makeup at 18 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.790
 and software like the coelacanths 16 then the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.759
 first time a friend 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 This is for everyone in your life. 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.540
 It's strange that I asked myself that. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.110
 same 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.390
 it's okay, not all , but when 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.560
 I decided to talk like this, it's not like that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.500
 I feel better 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.140
 I started using it on a daily basis all 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.090
 normality sold today when my 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.990
 Mother see me without makeup she talks about 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.460
 so my son are you well and what is it? 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.729
 It's also fair that I've already said some 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.830
 lives ago is that when I started to 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.200
 My money I did not have to give 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 satisfaction to anyone what I do 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.369
 not what kind they would be is that the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.780
 My parents would go home and if I 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.509
 I asked for a mall 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.970
 Imagine but I believe so at the moment 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.800
 that I started to earn my money and 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.780
 buy my things 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.910
 It's more of a help to do what I 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.700
 I want because it 's where we see here, not even 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.230
 I know if they want given words. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.650
 Why do not you come to me even if 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.690
 they wanted to create confusion would not have 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.570
 because that 's where anders 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.130
 and it's not just this danny that commented here 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.370
 to talk only about you 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.709
 I get several questions in the day to day 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.900
 How does your family read your style? 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.750
 and nanny and people like that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.380
 My tip is the following you have to 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.209
 be accepting first so look me 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.840
 I feel better wearing short or want to wear 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.269
 shock wants to wear makeup 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.980
 wore big hair you have to love yourself 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.709
 first ok 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.730
 there is the moment you are what I want 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.280
 that makes me good 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.769
 and then you'll talk like that, that's what 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.690
 I want and this fact from iesa will speak 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 so our daughters and wife who is 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.680
 excessive and do good to those who always like 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.769
 if your mother or father with a little 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.780
 conservative and what will take a while 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:27.470
 to arrive but with the day to day with a 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.200
 tire have a good time it will have you 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.750
 for the first time does not talk like that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.390
 from the second time they are already 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.299
 third time already do there when he 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.129
 I was alone without my son, you? 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.250
 It's okay, understood. 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.230
 it's all a matter of August the action to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.170
 Ivory Coast is a matter of custom 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.200
 I 'm trying to say it's kind of like you 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.989
 paint the hair the first day you do 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.590
 But then you 'll be fine then me. 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.609
 goals 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.609
 The tip is the following if view and be the 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:08.359
 Whatever you want if air because she 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.849
 between us we see these examples 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.920
 in the world of celebrity lady gaga by 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.120
 example that began by shocking the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.090
 meat dress 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.000
 today it is normal that we n is 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.780
 hurt then imagine yourself as if it were 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.979
 the lady gaga from your house you throw 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.669
 defends and from that year to god but later 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.760
 You're throwing more things, but it 's 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.510
 normal because everyone knows you are 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.210
 that's right 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.070
 but I 'm not afraid to use 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.849
 Then you'll regret it. 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.590
 you may regret later make 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.070
 Maybe then you'll get lucky . 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.410
 not want shock can also 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.410
 Do not be shy, I do not know, just go. 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.660
 creating much confusion and asks her to me 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.340
