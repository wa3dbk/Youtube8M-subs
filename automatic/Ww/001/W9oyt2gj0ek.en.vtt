title<00:00:02.010> but<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.159> really<00:00:02.610> don't<00:00:02.730> think<00:00:02.850> there<00:00:03.270> is

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
title but I really don't think there is

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.130 
title but I really don't think there is
such<00:00:03.419> thing<00:00:03.600> as<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:05.520> very<00:00:06.089> best<00:00:06.450> push<00:00:06.870> stick

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
such thing as the very best push stick

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.720 
such thing as the very best push stick
there<00:00:07.350> are<00:00:07.470> several<00:00:07.919> different<00:00:08.250> push<00:00:08.519> stick

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
there are several different push stick

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.000 
there are several different push stick
options<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.450> there<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.929> use<00:00:10.380> five<00:00:10.650> or<00:00:10.800> six

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
options out there I use five or six

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160 
options out there I use five or six
different<00:00:11.130> styles<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.790> my<00:00:11.910> shop<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> one

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
different styles in my shop but the one

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.720 
different styles in my shop but the one
that<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.349> use<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> most<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.219> one<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that I use the most is one that I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.700 
that I use the most is one that I
haven't<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.269> seen<00:00:15.389> too<00:00:15.809> much<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.260> YouTube

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
haven't really seen too much on YouTube

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.010 
haven't really seen too much on YouTube
so<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> figured<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.970> would<00:00:18.000> show<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
so I figured I would show you how to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.050 
so I figured I would show you how to
make<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.400> nothing<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:20.820> than<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
make one now it's nothing more than a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960 
make one now it's nothing more than a
block<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.750> two<00:00:22.199> by<00:00:22.380> six<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> couple<00:00:23.670> cuts

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
block of two by six with a couple cuts

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
block of two by six with a couple cuts
on<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 

I<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.460> made<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I thought that I just made is so that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
I thought that I just made is so that
this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> nice<00:00:34.350> flat<00:00:34.980> surface<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:35.850> you're

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this is a nice flat surface when you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.580 
this is a nice flat surface when you're
running<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.300> through<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> lot<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
running this through you have a lot of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.790 
running this through you have a lot of
stability<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.430> he<00:00:38.879> lessens<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.019> tendency<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
stability and he lessens the tendency to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.009 
stability and he lessens the tendency to
rock<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> reduce<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> size<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
rock now I'm going to reduce the size of

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.590 
rock now I'm going to reduce the size of
this<00:00:43.110> thing<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.769> kind<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> big<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
this thing because it is kind of big and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
this thing because it is kind of big and
I'm<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.019> to<00:00:46.140> miter<00:00:46.620> off<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> back

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I'm just going to miter off the back

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.619 
I'm just going to miter off the back
corner<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:50.510> somewhere<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
corner of just a little bit somewhere in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.590 
corner of just a little bit somewhere in
here<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> hole<00:00:52.949> cut<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.879> grab<00:00:54.149> ahold<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
here will be a hole cut to grab ahold of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.030 
here will be a hole cut to grab ahold of
and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:55.589> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.030> front<00:00:57.710> we're<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
and then up here in the front we're just

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:24.370 
and then up here in the front we're just
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:01:00.409> reduce<00:01:01.409> some<00:01:01.860> weight

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.780 

these<00:01:25.380> angled<00:01:25.740> cuts<00:01:26.010> are<00:01:26.310> pretty<00:01:26.640> much

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
these angled cuts are pretty much

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
these angled cuts are pretty much
irrelevant<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.570> doesn't<00:01:27.810> matter<00:01:27.900> what

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
irrelevant it really doesn't matter what

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.800 
irrelevant it really doesn't matter what
the<00:01:28.380> angle<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.010> go<00:01:29.190> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.030> reason<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.660> have

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the angle you go with the reason I have

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
the angle you go with the reason I have
this<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.170> cut<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.100> give<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.430> handle

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this back cut is to give your handle

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
this back cut is to give your handle
grab<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.300> a<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.870> comfort<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
grab just a little bit more comfort and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.590 
grab just a little bit more comfort and
the<00:01:34.890> front<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.370> mainly<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> reduce

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the front is mainly just to reduce

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.540 
the front is mainly just to reduce
weight<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.380> push<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> material<00:01:37.800> through<00:01:38.400> I'm

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
weight to push the material through I'm

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.950 
weight to push the material through I'm
going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.760> add<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.270> block<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.870> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going to add this little block to the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
going to add this little block to the
back<00:01:39.990> side<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
back side and I want to make sure that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.170 
back side and I want to make sure that
the<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:42.390> side<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.700> push<00:01:44.700> stick<00:01:44.940> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the right side of the push stick is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
the right side of the push stick is
lined<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.410> right<00:01:46.560> side<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.980> this<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
lined up with the right side of this so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
lined up with the right side of this so
that<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.300> not<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.900> hung<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.590> fence

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that it does not get hung on the fence

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
that it does not get hung on the fence
as<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.640> push<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.180> through<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.690> reason<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
as you push it through the reason I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
as you push it through the reason I
really<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.230> this<00:01:58.620> wider<00:01:59.040> push<00:01:59.370> stick<00:01:59.640> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
really like this wider push stick is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.030 
really like this wider push stick is
it's<00:02:00.030> incredibly<00:02:00.510> stable<00:02:00.840> gives<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> nice

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it's incredibly stable gives you a nice

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's incredibly stable gives you a nice
flat<00:02:02.370> surface<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:02.940> push<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> work<00:02:03.510> through<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
flat surface to push a work through and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380 
flat surface to push a work through and
the<00:02:04.380> length<00:02:04.650> gives<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.550> downward<00:02:06.090> pressure

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the length gives you downward pressure

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.530 
the length gives you downward pressure
on<00:02:06.570> both<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.320> back<00:02:08.070> side<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.700> cut<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
on both the back side of the cut and the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.700 
on both the back side of the cut and the
front<00:02:09.750> side<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> cut<00:02:10.260> as<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.560> going

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
front side of the cut as it's going

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.470 
front side of the cut as it's going
through<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.070> blade<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.850> will<00:02:12.060> reduce<00:02:12.240> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
through the blade which will reduce the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.980 

because<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.210> much<00:02:23.330> height<00:02:23.630> here<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
because you have so much height here to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.200 
because you have so much height here to
work<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.920> bottom<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.150> a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
work with the bottom of this is a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.060 
work with the bottom of this is a
sacrificial<00:02:27.080> surface<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.620> go<00:02:27.770> right

sacrificial surface that can go right

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.250 
sacrificial surface that can go right
through<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.790> blade<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.300> offer<00:02:29.720> pressure

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
through the blade and offer pressure

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.470 
through the blade and offer pressure
throughout<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> entire<00:02:31.250> pork<00:02:31.640> piece<00:02:31.880> as<00:02:32.150> it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
throughout the entire pork piece as it

throughout the entire pork piece as it
goes<00:02:32.660> through<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.310> handle

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
goes through and because this handle

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.030 
goes through and because this handle
back<00:02:35.240> here<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> wider<00:02:36.200> than<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.470> piece<00:02:36.710> or<00:02:36.950> at

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
least as wide as the push stick is you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.280 
least as wide as the push stick is you
will<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.520> pushing<00:02:40.910> both<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.420> cut<00:02:41.750> piece<00:02:42.020> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
will be pushing both the cut piece and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:03:32.190 
will be pushing both the cut piece and
the<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:42.740> cut<00:02:43.040> piece<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.700> same<00:02:43.940> motion

like<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:33.040> said<00:03:33.099> there's<00:03:33.459> no<00:03:33.640> such<00:03:33.790> thing<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
like I said there's no such thing as the

best push stick there's a lot of good

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.630 
best push stick there's a lot of good
push<00:03:37.209> stick<00:03:37.450> options<00:03:37.959> out<00:03:38.200> there<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.800> find<00:03:39.430> this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
push stick options out there I find this

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.510 
push stick options out there I find this
to<00:03:39.880> be<00:03:39.910> very<00:03:40.060> handy<00:03:41.130> hopefully<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.310> have
