 the distance even 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 look at the roofs of houses next to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949

 thickets around the perimeter of the cordon 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 so that no one could interfere 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.229
 nobody says to investigators when 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.640

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.640
