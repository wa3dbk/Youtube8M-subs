special attack with the quiet nature

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
special attack with the quiet nature
because<00:00:37.200> when<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.770> running<00:00:37.920> trick<00:00:38.700> room

because when you're running trick room

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.510 
because when you're running trick room
you<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.629> lower<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> speech<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
double check there's the quiet nature
and<00:00:44.329> that's<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.690> awesome<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and that's pretty awesome so when you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
and that's pretty awesome so when you
have<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> high<00:00:47.370> special<00:00:47.760> attack<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.420> we

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
have a high special attack like this we

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
have a high special attack like this we
were<00:00:49.050> running<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.590> damage<00:00:49.890> calculators

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
were running some damage calculators

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
were running some damage calculators
with<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> life<00:00:51.510> orb<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.020> there's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
with the life orb and there's a lot of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.060 
with the life orb and there's a lot of
good<00:00:53.190> potential<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.379> either<00:00:55.379> super

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
good potential here for either super

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
good potential here for either super
crazy<00:00:56.610> amounts<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.059> damage<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.600> lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.840> tunic

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
crazy amounts of damage a lot of tunic

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
crazy amounts of damage a lot of tunic
arrows<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.590> high<00:00:58.739> threats<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.370> potential<00:00:59.910> 1

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
arrows on high threats or potential 1

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
arrows on high threats or potential 1
hit<00:01:00.210> Kos<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> super<00:01:01.320> effective<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
hit Kos if it's a super effective hit so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.210 
hit Kos if it's a super effective hit so
really<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> idea<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> use

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
really the idea here is that you use

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
really the idea here is that you use
this<00:01:05.460> residual<00:01:06.420> base<00:01:06.689> tankiness<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this residual base tankiness that you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
this residual base tankiness that you
know<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.909> decent<00:01:09.090> amount<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> hit

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
know with that's a decent amount of hit

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
know with that's a decent amount of hit
points<00:01:09.570> decent<00:01:10.290> amount<00:01:10.439> defenses<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.130> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
points decent amount defenses you can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
points decent amount defenses you can
make<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> where<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> set<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> trick

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
make it to where you set up the trick

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.550 
make it to where you set up the trick
room<00:01:12.950> BM<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.750> hard<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.409> hit

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
room BM is really really hard to one hit

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
room BM is really really hard to one hit
ko<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.759> few<00:01:17.970> Pokemon<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> be

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
ko like very few Pokemon do it has to be

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
ko like very few Pokemon do it has to be
a<00:01:19.350> super<00:01:19.619> effective<00:01:19.830> hit<00:01:20.159> essentially<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
a super effective hit essentially so you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
a super effective hit essentially so you
get<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> free<00:01:21.960> trick<00:01:22.200> room<00:01:22.350> setup<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> now

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
get that free trick room setup and now

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
get that free trick room setup and now
you<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.909> potential<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.509> do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you also have the potential to do

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.960 
you also have the potential to do
singles<00:01:25.170> trick<00:01:25.439> room<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.790> good

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
singles trick room with really good

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
singles trick room with really good
coverage<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> dark<00:01:28.619> pulse<00:01:28.890> charge

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
coverage it's like a dark pulse charge

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
coverage it's like a dark pulse charge
beam<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.210> moves<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
beam a lot of these moves are going to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
beam a lot of these moves are going to
have<00:01:31.470> good<00:01:31.799> one-hit<00:01:32.159> ko<00:01:32.310> potential<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.450> well

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have good one-hit ko potential as well

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
have good one-hit ko potential as well
as<00:01:33.720> too<00:01:33.869> big<00:01:34.020> ko<00:01:34.229> potential<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> get

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
as too big ko potential and if you get

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.950 
as too big ko potential and if you get
that<00:01:35.670> charge<00:01:35.880> beam<00:01:36.119> set<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that charge beam set up you have a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
that charge beam set up you have a
sweeper<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.310> having<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.579> good

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
sweeper you're going to be having a good

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
sweeper you're going to be having a good
amount<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> special<00:01:39.689> attack<00:01:40.189> effectively<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
amount of special attack effectively the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.429 
amount of special attack effectively the
fastest<00:01:42.030> Pokemon<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> field<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
fastest Pokemon on the field because of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
fastest Pokemon on the field because of
the<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.979> trick<00:01:44.250> room<00:01:44.399> works<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the way that trick room works and it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.760 
the way that trick room works and it
could<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:46.049> also<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> get

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
could be really good also if you get

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
could be really good also if you get
knocked<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.340> still<00:01:47.549> might<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.909> 1<00:01:48.630> 2

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
knocked out you still might have 1 2

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530 
knocked out you still might have 1 2
maybe<00:01:49.200> 3<00:01:49.350> terms<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.950> trick<00:01:50.130> room<00:01:50.310> left<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
maybe 3 terms of trick room left so you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
maybe 3 terms of trick room left so you
can<00:01:51.750> continue<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> trick<00:01:52.649> room<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
can continue the trick room with the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
can continue the trick room with the
rest<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> your<00:01:53.460> team's<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> maybe<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
rest of your team's and maybe make it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
rest of your team's and maybe make it
work<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.899> singles<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> ability

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
work for singles with the ability

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.010 
work for singles with the ability
synchronized<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.119> feel<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.509> synchronized

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
synchronized I feel that synchronized

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.039 
synchronized I feel that synchronized
can<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.950> beneficial<00:01:59.420> just<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
can be very beneficial just because that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
can be very beneficial just because that
your<00:02:01.890> opponent<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> what

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this guy's ability is they might think

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
this guy's ability is they might think
hey<00:02:04.829> I'll<00:02:05.009> status<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> down<00:02:05.729> I'll<00:02:05.969> burn<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> off

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
hey I'll status it down I'll burn it off

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
hey I'll status it down I'll burn it off
paralyze<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.259> might<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.099> able<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> bounce

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
paralyze it might be able to bounce

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.710 
paralyze it might be able to bounce
something<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.209> opponent

another coverage move here energy ball

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.950 
another coverage move here energy ball
something<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.580> run<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> analytic

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
something like that run the analytic

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.710 
something like that run the analytic
makes<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.070> where<00:02:20.100> if<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.640> move<00:02:21.060> last<00:02:21.450> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
makes it to where if you move last you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.650 
makes it to where if you move last you
do<00:02:21.900> 30%<00:02:22.830> more<00:02:22.950> damage<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:24.150> statute<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
do 30% more damage so that statute the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.810 
do 30% more damage so that statute the
life<00:02:24.870> orb<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.740> doing<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.160> lot<00:02:26.550> of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
life orb is going to be doing a lot of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.180 
life orb is going to be doing a lot of
damage<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:28.290> why<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.830> being<00:02:29.070> here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
damage that's why we think being here

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.670 
damage that's why we think being here
might<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.580> strong<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.510> here's<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.260> Verla

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
might be strong now here's the Verla

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
might be strong now here's the Verla
strategy<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.550> looked<00:02:33.030> at<00:02:33.150> him<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.480> saw<00:02:33.750> cosmic

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
strategy I looked at him I saw cosmic

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.890 
strategy I looked at him I saw cosmic
power<00:02:34.530> boom<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.880> there<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.360> got<00:02:36.630> excited

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
power boom right there I got excited

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.380 
power boom right there I got excited
because<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.640> stockpile<00:02:38.640> boost<00:02:39.210> your

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
because that stockpile boost your

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.630 
because that stockpile boost your
defense<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.840> special<00:02:40.020> defense<00:02:40.410> by<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.950> so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
defense and special defense by one so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.120 
defense and special defense by one so
using<00:02:42.540> all<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.780> good<00:02:43.110> tankiness<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.890> was

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
using all this good tankiness it was

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.160 
using all this good tankiness it was
honest<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.240> their<00:02:45.390> centrally<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:45.990> hard

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
honest are their centrally really hard

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.190 
honest are their centrally really hard
to<00:02:46.260> Pokemon<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.800> kill<00:02:47.070> before<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.870> one

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
to Pokemon to kill before that the one

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.570 
to Pokemon to kill before that the one
hit<00:02:49.350> Gale<00:02:49.470> potential<00:02:49.920> isn't<00:02:50.190> there<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.490> a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
hit Gale potential isn't there that's a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.060 
hit Gale potential isn't there that's a
two<00:02:50.790> three<00:02:51.060> four<00:02:51.450> hit<00:02:51.600> ko<00:02:51.810> without<00:02:52.800> any

two three four hit ko without any

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.710 
two three four hit ko without any
defensive<00:02:53.610> investment<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.300> now<00:02:54.450> we're

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
defensive investment so now we're

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.170 
defensive investment so now we're
looking<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.230> cosmic<00:02:55.709> power<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.250> it's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
looking at that cosmic power and it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.060 
looking at that cosmic power and it's
going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.840> pretty<00:02:58.200> tanky<00:02:58.500> Pokemon<00:02:58.980> that

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
going to be a pretty tanky Pokemon that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.980 
going to be a pretty tanky Pokemon that
you<00:02:59.160> use<00:02:59.280> charge<00:02:59.580> beam<00:02:59.820> to<00:03:00.390> set<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
you use charge beam to set up like that

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.860 
you use charge beam to set up like that
psychic<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.890> your<00:03:02.880> other<00:03:03.060> coverage<00:03:03.420> move<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
psychic as your other coverage move and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.230 
psychic as your other coverage move and
now<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.380> defense<00:03:05.340> boost<00:03:05.580> special

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
now you have defense boost special

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.090 
now you have defense boost special
defense<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:06.750> not<00:03:07.110> special<00:03:07.470> defense<00:03:07.709> mold

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
attack as well as good coverage this is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.640 
attack as well as good coverage this is
where<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.360> analytic<00:03:12.840> ability<00:03:13.230> works<00:03:13.440> really

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
where the analytic ability works really

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.800 
where the analytic ability works really
well<00:03:13.890> again<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.450> also<00:03:15.630> have

look<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.709> that's<00:03:19.950> some<00:03:20.100> craziness<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:20.850> we

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
look at that that's some craziness so we

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.880 
look at that that's some craziness so we
have<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> lot<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.720> damage<00:03:21.989> spreading<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.620> lot<00:03:22.769> of

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
have a lot of damage spreading a lot of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
have a lot of damage spreading a lot of
tankiness<00:03:23.370> item<00:03:24.090> could<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.300> leftovers<00:03:25.290> or

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
tankiness item could be leftovers or

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.910 
tankiness item could be leftovers or
anything<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.600> that's<00:03:28.110> my<00:03:28.380> take<00:03:28.739> on

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
anything like that so that's my take on

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.130 
anything like that so that's my take on
bahia<00:03:29.880> mitt<00:03:30.180> could<00:03:30.300> work<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.600> well<00:03:30.810> and

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
bahia mitt could work really well and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.500 
bahia mitt could work really well and
then<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:31.650> also<00:03:31.890> have<00:03:32.280> options<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.390> this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
then we also have options like this

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.780 
then we also have options like this
isn't<00:03:33.810> moveset<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.380> all<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.739> one<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:35.670> cool

isn't moveset at all but one really cool

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.449 
isn't moveset at all but one really cool

think it is surprising that you know if

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.219 
think it is surprising that you know if
you<00:04:40.270> kept<00:04:40.449> something<00:04:40.659> off<00:04:40.810> guard<00:04:41.050> with<00:04:41.199> that

it does have that sweeping potential

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.879 
it does have that sweeping potential
with<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.810> trick<00:05:11.020> room<00:05:11.229> or<00:05:11.409> maybe<00:05:11.800> even
