00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
upper 30s across Northwest Arkansas so
this<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> cold<00:00:47.610> air

the temperature significantly for Sunday
this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:10.740> arctic<00:01:11.159> air<00:01:11.340> mass<00:01:11.600> meaning<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
this is an arctic air mass meaning it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
this is an arctic air mass meaning it's
very<00:01:12.960> low<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> ground<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.950> shallow<00:01:14.400> and

very low to the ground very shallow and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
very low to the ground very shallow and
it<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> not<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.020> moved<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.500> easily

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it is not going to be moved very easily

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
it is not going to be moved very easily
a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> computer<00:01:18.150> models<00:01:18.509> saying<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a lot of the computer models saying this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
a lot of the computer models saying this
cold<00:01:19.290> air<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> retreat<00:01:20.520> rather

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
cold air is going to retreat rather

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.780 
cold air is going to retreat rather
quickly<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:22.200> believe<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.610> arctic<00:01:23.610> air

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
quickly I don't believe that arctic air

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
quickly I don't believe that arctic air
doesn't<00:01:24.150> behave<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.860> means

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
doesn't behave like that and that means

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.440 
doesn't behave like that and that means
it's<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> entrenched<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's going to be entrenched over the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's going to be entrenched over the
area<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.229> while<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> setup

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
area a little while so this is the setup

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370

weather<00:01:36.540> system<00:01:37.049> coming<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> two-part

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
weather system what I mean by that is
the<00:01:41.189> first<00:01:41.430> part<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:42.119> come<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> low

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the first part will come in with a low

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
the first part will come in with a low
pressure<00:01:43.829> system<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.790> off<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.299> our<00:01:45.329> West<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
pressure system just off to our West so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
pressure system just off to our West so
if<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
if we take a look here there will be a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
if we take a look here there will be a
low<00:01:48.270> pressure<00:01:48.540> system<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.350> begins<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.950> move

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
low pressure system that begins to move

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.670 
low pressure system that begins to move
and<00:01:50.549> translate<00:01:51.090> eastward<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.229> happens

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and translate eastward this happens

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
and translate eastward this happens
Sunday<00:01:53.159> evening<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> overnight<00:01:54.119> hours

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
Sunday evening into the overnight hours

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.530 
Sunday evening into the overnight hours
as<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> low<00:01:55.590> moves<00:01:55.619> overhead<00:01:56.399> we've<00:01:57.149> got<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
as that low moves overhead we've got the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.830 
as that low moves overhead we've got the
warm<00:01:57.810> air<00:01:58.079> surging<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> south<00:01:59.310> and

warm air surging up from the south and
that<00:02:00.840> warm<00:02:01.229> air<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.710> lead<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> potential

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that warm air will lead to the potential

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.690 
that warm air will lead to the potential
for<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.540> wintry<00:02:04.259> mix<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.770> freezing<00:02:05.250> rain<00:02:05.280> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
accumulation and you can see that this

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.750 
accumulation and you can see that this
is<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.660> specifically<00:04:07.590> ice<00:04:07.920> accumulation

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760

then you can see that bullseye over

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.060 
then you can see that bullseye over
Central<00:04:15.900> Arkansas<00:04:16.200> now<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.709> know<00:04:16.770> you're

Central Arkansas now I know you're

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.099 
Central Arkansas now I know you're
seeing<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.790> going<00:04:17.910> oh<00:04:18.180> no<00:04:18.480> ice<00:04:18.720> storm

seeing this and going oh no ice storm
for<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> little<00:04:20.130> rock<00:04:20.310> well<00:04:20.640> this<00:04:21.270> could<00:04:21.510> easily

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
for a little rock well this could easily

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.290 
for a little rock well this could easily
shift<00:04:22.169> northward<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:23.160> could<00:04:23.430> shift<00:04:23.640> southward

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
shift northward it could shift southward

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.420 
shift northward it could shift southward
it<00:04:24.540> could<00:04:24.720> turn<00:04:24.870> more<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.440> sleep<00:04:25.650> instead<00:04:26.280> of

it could turn more to sleep instead of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.470 
it could turn more to sleep instead of

so you know all of this is in question I
just<00:04:30.210> want<00:04:30.420> to<00:04:30.510> show<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.080> models

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
just want to show you that the models

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.110 
just want to show you that the models
are<00:04:31.530> showing<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.920> pretty<00:04:32.160> substantial<00:04:32.940> ice

freezing<00:04:46.350> rain<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.800> sleet<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.310> still<00:04:47.670> think<00:04:47.700> we

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
freezing rain and sleet I still think we

do see freezing rain and sleet on Sunday
night<00:04:50.400> into<00:04:50.520> Monday<00:04:50.580> but<00:04:51.390> look<00:04:51.540> what<00:04:51.750> happens

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
night into Monday but look what happens

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.160 
night into Monday but look what happens
monday<00:04:52.760> evening<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:53.940> into<00:04:54.060> Tuesday<00:04:54.360> there's

monday evening and into Tuesday there's
system<00:04:55.680> number<00:04:56.010> one<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.420> already<00:04:57.630> has<00:04:57.930> snow

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
system number one so it already has snow

plains will be impacted by the storm do

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.870 
plains will be impacted by the storm do
not<00:05:09.960> look<00:05:10.200> at<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.770> six<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.400> 12<00:05:11.670> inches

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
not look at just the six to 12 inches

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.090 
not look at just the six to 12 inches
and<00:05:12.330> say<00:05:12.480> that's<00:05:12.660> what<00:05:13.020> we're<00:05:13.200> getting<00:05:13.380> that's

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
and say that's what we're getting that's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.220 
and say that's what we're getting that's
just<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.580> computer<00:05:15.060> model<00:05:15.240> all<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:16.080> those

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.560 
system one that starts and you'll see
this<00:05:25.410> as<00:05:25.650> we<00:05:25.800> look<00:05:25.920> at<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.160> timing

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
this as we look at the timing

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.820 
this as we look at the timing
precipitation<00:05:27.570> will<00:05:27.870> start<00:05:28.170> late<00:05:28.380> Sunday

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
precipitation will start late Sunday

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.190 
precipitation will start late Sunday
night<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:30.180> think<00:05:30.480> it's<00:05:30.630> going<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.870> be<00:05:30.960> heavy

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
night and I think it's going to be heavy

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.010 
night and I think it's going to be heavy
enough<00:05:31.350> but<00:05:31.920> on<00:05:32.240> Monday<00:05:33.240> morning<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.810> cause

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
enough but on Monday morning to cause

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.260 
enough but on Monday morning to cause
some<00:05:34.260> issues<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> roads<00:05:35.220> freezing<00:05:36.090> rain

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
some issues on the roads freezing rain

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.200 
some issues on the roads freezing rain
sleet<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.870> rain<00:05:36.960> all<00:05:37.710> likely<00:05:38.310> for<00:05:38.550> Monday<00:05:38.970> and

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
sleet and rain all likely for Monday and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.180 
sleet and rain all likely for Monday and
it's<00:05:39.720> going<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.080> wide<00:05:40.380> range<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.920> winter

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
it's going to be a wide range of winter

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.130 
it's going to be a wide range of winter
precipitation<00:05:41.370> types<00:05:42.240> but<00:05:42.480> then<00:05:42.660> as<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:42.960> move

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
precipitation types but then as we move

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.660 
precipitation types but then as we move
into<00:05:43.290> Tuesday<00:05:43.800> as<00:05:43.980> that<00:05:44.130> next<00:05:44.370> cold<00:05:44.580> front

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
into Tuesday as that next cold front

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.950 
into Tuesday as that next cold front
comes<00:05:45.090> in<00:05:45.270> it's<00:05:45.450> going<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.720> be<00:05:45.780> all

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
comes in it's going to be all

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.590

will<00:05:48.870> start<00:05:49.140> Tuesday<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:49.980> morning<00:05:50.400> that's

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
will start Tuesday in the morning that's

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.520 
will start Tuesday in the morning that's
in<00:05:50.790> question<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:51.450> could<00:05:51.630> start<00:05:51.900> late<00:05:52.170> as<00:05:52.350> as

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
in question it could start late as as

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.280 
in question it could start late as as
early<00:05:53.160> as<00:05:53.280> Monday<00:05:53.670> night<00:05:53.940> then<00:05:54.600> we<00:05:54.720> got<00:05:54.870> cold

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
early as Monday night then we got cold

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.410 
early as Monday night then we got cold
for<00:05:55.740> Wednesday<00:05:56.190> behind<00:05:56.580> this<00:05:56.820> weather<00:05:57.120> system

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
for Wednesday behind this weather system

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.540 
for Wednesday behind this weather system
colder<00:05:58.290> than<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:58.530> think<00:05:58.800> what<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.070> models<00:05:59.460> are

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
colder than I think what the models are

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.050 
colder than I think what the models are
showing<00:05:59.610> so<00:06:00.540> then<00:06:00.720> we<00:06:00.870> so<00:06:01.440> where<00:06:01.620> will<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.890> hit

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
showing so then we so where will it hit

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.580 
showing so then we so where will it hit
widespread<00:06:03.060> winter<00:06:03.420> precipitation<00:06:03.600> as<00:06:04.410> you

low-level warm air temperatures are in
question<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.430> energy<00:06:29.580> and

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
question and the energy and

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.450 
question and the energy and
precipitation<00:06:30.510> in<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.870> cold<00:06:31.110> air<00:06:31.290> is<00:06:31.530> all<00:06:31.980> in

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.460 
precipitation in the cold air is all in
questions<00:06:33.030> so<00:06:33.210> obviously<00:06:33.810> there's<00:06:34.110> always

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
questions so obviously there's always

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.260 
questions so obviously there's always
questions<00:06:34.680> with<00:06:35.280> forecasting<00:06:36.000> winter

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
questions with forecasting winter

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570 
questions with forecasting winter
weather<00:06:36.450> but<00:06:37.230> the<00:06:37.290> bottom<00:06:37.620> line<00:06:37.650> is<00:06:37.830> we've<00:06:38.550> got

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
weather but the bottom line is we've got

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.550 
weather but the bottom line is we've got
a<00:06:38.790> big<00:06:39.150> weather<00:06:39.330> system<00:06:39.870> coming<00:06:39.900> in<00:06:40.350> it's

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
a big weather system coming in it's

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.760 
a big weather system coming in it's
going

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
going

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.129 
going
be<00:06:40.889> a<00:06:40.919> two-part<00:06:41.460> system<00:06:41.759> we<00:06:42.300> have<00:06:42.419> one<00:06:42.690> moving

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
be a two-part system we have one moving

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.499 
be a two-part system we have one moving
in<00:06:43.319> on<00:06:43.530> Sunday<00:06:44.370> night<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:44.759> lasting
