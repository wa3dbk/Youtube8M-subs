probably<00:02:01.619> two<00:02:02.040> inches<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> other

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
probably two inches from like the other

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230 
probably two inches from like the other
side<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> tip<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.399> pressed<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.969> really

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
side of the tip and I pressed in really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.529 
side of the tip and I pressed in really
hard<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> came<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> worked<00:02:08.539> so

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
hard and it came off so it worked so

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.459 
hard and it came off so it worked so
then

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
then

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.440 
then
uh<00:02:11.499> it<00:02:12.099> was<00:02:12.249> like<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.430> bunch<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.819> like<00:02:13.030> really

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
uh it was like a bunch of like really

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.709 
uh it was like a bunch of like really
weird<00:02:13.840> stringy<00:02:14.469> pieces<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.120> no<00:02:16.389> idea

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
weird stringy pieces and I have no idea

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.420 
weird stringy pieces and I have no idea
about<00:02:16.870> technology<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.859> what<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.040> need<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
about technology and what I need and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.739 
about technology and what I need and
what<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.549> don't<00:02:18.670> need<00:02:18.969> so<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.209> kind<00:02:19.389> of<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.629> try

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:19.749 
what I don't need so I kind of just try

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.479 
what I don't need so I kind of just try
to<00:02:19.810> figure<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.109> out<00:02:20.230> myself<00:02:20.730> um<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.249> got<00:02:24.249> all

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
to figure it out myself um so I got all

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.410 
to figure it out myself um so I got all
the<00:02:24.730> other<00:02:24.909> pieces<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.579> there's<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.639> green<00:02:28.000> and

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
red and black one so I got all of them

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.649 
red and black one so I got all of them
and<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.099> pushed<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.609> all<00:02:36.760> down<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.389> then

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
and like pushed it all down and then

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.390 
and like pushed it all down and then
just<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.319> taped<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.739> together<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:39.189> try<00:02:39.340> to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
just like taped it together to try to

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.059 
just like taped it together to try to
make<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.669> look<00:02:39.790> pretty<00:02:40.019> all<00:02:41.019> right<00:02:41.319> then<00:02:41.560> so

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
make it look pretty all right then so

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.789 
make it look pretty all right then so
and<00:02:42.609> I<00:02:43.090> try<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.389> leave<00:02:43.689> like<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.169> much<00:02:44.530> space

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
and I try to leave like that much space

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.830 
and I try to leave like that much space
you<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.519> say<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.409> I<00:02:48.540> figured<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.689> you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
you can say so then I figured out you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can say so then I figured out you
have<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.199> get<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.459> right<00:02:51.939> in<00:02:52.090> black<00:02:52.389> part<00:02:52.719> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
have to get the right in black part you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.199 
have to get the right in black part you
have<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.139> burn<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.560> down<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:54.189> little<00:02:54.639> well<00:02:54.939> no

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
have to burn it down a little well no

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.550 
have to burn it down a little well no
they<00:02:55.449> didn't<00:02:55.659> tell<00:02:55.750> me<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.409> to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they didn't tell me that you have to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.839 
they didn't tell me that you have to
like<00:02:56.939> peel<00:02:57.939> it<00:02:58.120> down<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.810> these<00:02:59.199> things<00:02:59.849> stick

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
like peel it down so these things stick

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.869 
like peel it down so these things stick
out<00:03:01.060> um

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
out um

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.659 
out um
again<00:03:03.879> this<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.359> total<00:03:04.840> retarded<00:03:05.319> proof

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
again this is like total retarded proof

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.860 
again this is like total retarded proof
instructions<00:03:06.669> in<00:03:06.879> case<00:03:06.909> anyone's<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.689> me

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
instructions in case anyone's like me

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.520 
instructions in case anyone's like me
and<00:03:08.079> doesn't<00:03:08.919> know<00:03:09.659> what<00:03:10.659> positive<00:03:11.319> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
and doesn't know what positive and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.530 
and doesn't know what positive and
negative<00:03:11.889> charge<00:03:12.189> and<00:03:12.489> bla<00:03:12.760> bla<00:03:12.909> bla<00:03:12.969> Bhushan

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
negative charge and bla bla bla Bhushan

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.030 
negative charge and bla bla bla Bhushan
means<00:03:13.810> anyways<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:15.519> then<00:03:15.759> I<00:03:16.090> figured<00:03:17.040> plastic

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
means anyways so then I figured plastic

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.770 
means anyways so then I figured plastic
would<00:03:18.220> probably<00:03:18.729> melt<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.299> wouldn't<00:03:19.629> like

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
would probably melt and I wouldn't like

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.929 
would probably melt and I wouldn't like
tear<00:03:20.049> any<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.439> the<00:03:20.530> cords<00:03:20.859> up<00:03:21.009> so<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:21.729> got<00:03:21.909> a

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
tear any of the cords up so I got a

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.439 
tear any of the cords up so I got a
lighter

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
lighter

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.390 
lighter
I<00:03:22.750> don't<00:03:23.229> smoke<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.739> don't<00:03:23.889> have<00:03:24.009> the<00:03:24.129> cute

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
I don't smoke so I don't have the cute

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.860 
I don't smoke so I don't have the cute
little<00:03:24.549> long<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:25.030> got<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.269> big<00:03:25.419> candle

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
little long so I got the big candle

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.449 
little long so I got the big candle
lighter

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
lighter

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.189 
lighter

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
probably like a 10-minute job but um it

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.330 
probably like a 10-minute job but um it
does<00:06:20.340> work<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:21.530> just<00:06:22.530> keep<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:22.919> kind<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.160> down
