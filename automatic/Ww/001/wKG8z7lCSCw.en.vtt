00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
because the other ones all worried if

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.530 
because the other ones all worried if
you<00:00:10.240> didn't<00:00:10.480> see<00:00:10.599> that<00:00:10.750> one<00:00:10.929> already<00:00:11.290> but<00:00:12.540> this

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
you didn't see that one already but this

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.169 
you didn't see that one already but this
is<00:00:13.690> my<00:00:13.840> 91<00:00:14.320> or<00:00:14.620> 93<00:00:15.420> LX<00:00:16.439> 176<00:00:17.759> good<00:00:18.759> I<00:00:18.880> bought<00:00:19.089> it

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:19.179 
is my 91 or 93 LX 176 good I bought it

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.389 
is my 91 or 93 LX 176 good I bought it
from<00:00:19.300> so<00:00:19.569> that's<00:00:19.720> an<00:00:19.929> 83<00:00:20.529> but<00:00:20.739> the<00:00:20.919> seat<00:00:21.189> says

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:21.399 
from so that's an 83 but the seat says

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.069 
from so that's an 83 but the seat says
it's<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.669> 91<00:00:22.119> but<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.449> seat<00:00:22.689> could<00:00:22.869> have<00:00:22.960> been

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
it's a 91 but the seat could have been

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.979 
it's a 91 but the seat could have been
an<00:00:23.919> older<00:00:24.249> seat<00:00:24.489> that<00:00:24.669> was<00:00:24.759> put<00:00:24.939> on<00:00:25.089> before<00:00:25.720> the

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
an older seat that was put on before the

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.639 
an older seat that was put on before the
original<00:00:26.409> seat<00:00:26.619> or<00:00:26.800> after<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.189> original<00:00:27.369> seat

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
original seat or after the original seat

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.769 
original seat or after the original seat
but<00:00:29.649> as<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.220> can<00:00:30.309> see<00:00:30.489> it's<00:00:30.639> all<00:00:30.759> taken<00:00:31.539> apart

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
but as you can see it's all taken apart

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.910 
but as you can see it's all taken apart
because<00:00:31.960> I<00:00:32.140> was<00:00:32.259> trying<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.559> figure<00:00:32.710> out

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
because I was trying to figure out

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.569 
because I was trying to figure out
what's<00:00:33.760> wrong<00:00:33.910> with<00:00:34.350> transmission<00:00:35.429> it<00:00:36.429> was

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
what's wrong with transmission it was

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.930 
what's wrong with transmission it was
making<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.179> grinding<00:00:37.570> sound<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.820> heard<00:00:39.820> I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
making a grinding sound and I heard I

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.279 
making a grinding sound and I heard I
could<00:00:40.120> take<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:40.269> apart<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.750> figure<00:00:40.929> out<00:00:41.079> why

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
could take it apart and figure out why

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.509 
could take it apart and figure out why
it<00:00:41.320> did<00:00:41.949> that<00:00:42.269> but<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.469> far<00:00:44.679> no<00:00:44.890> luck<00:00:44.920> but<00:00:45.399> if

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
it did that but so far no luck but if

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:46.919 
it did that but so far no luck but if
you<00:00:45.609> have<00:00:45.730> any<00:00:45.879> ideas<00:00:46.300> on<00:00:46.420> what<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.629> might<00:00:46.719> be

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
you have any ideas on what it might be

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.110 
you have any ideas on what it might be
please<00:00:47.289> feel<00:00:48.280> free<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.489> comment<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:48.940> let<00:00:49.089> me

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
please feel free to comment and let me

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.979 
please feel free to comment and let me
know<00:00:49.239> what<00:00:49.390> you<00:00:49.480> think

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
know what you think

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.759 
know what you think
I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.570> gears<00:00:52.839> are<00:00:53.050> stripped<00:00:53.079> on<00:00:53.530> it

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
I think the gears are stripped on it

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.829 
I think the gears are stripped on it
because<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:55.019> was<00:00:56.019> making<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.379> grinding<00:00:56.769> sound

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
because it was making a grinding sound

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.290 
because it was making a grinding sound
so<00:00:58.839> I<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:02.440> got<00:01:02.620> one<00:01:02.800> car<00:01:03.039> in<00:01:03.129> here<00:01:03.309> but<00:01:03.489> know

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
so I got we got one car in here but know

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.550 
so I got we got one car in here but know
that<00:01:04.509> I<00:01:04.540> put<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.780> other<00:01:04.899> car<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.199> here<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.470> I

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
that I put the other car in here so I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.889 
that I put the other car in here so I
guess<00:01:05.829> I<00:01:05.950> gotta<00:01:06.299> hurry<00:01:07.299> up<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.570> make<00:01:07.689> some

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
guess I gotta hurry up and make some

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.020 
guess I gotta hurry up and make some
room<00:01:08.079> for<00:01:08.130> before<00:01:09.130> my<00:01:09.280> stuff<00:01:09.520> dad<00:01:09.670> gets<00:01:09.909> home
