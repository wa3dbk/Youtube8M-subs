00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
not only keeps my basement warm but it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
isn't overly hot the hosts the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
isn't overly hot the hosts the
temperature<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> constant<00:00:46.980> throughout<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.910 
temperature is constant throughout the
house<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.539> ask<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
house don't ask me how it does it but a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
house don't ask me how it does it but a
thing<00:00:50.129> works<00:00:50.309> great<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> clean<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> out

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
thing works great well I clean it out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.459 
thing works great well I clean it out
quite<00:00:52.829> often<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.539> dump<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> ash<00:00:54.809> pan<00:00:55.140> every

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
quite often I dump the ash pan every

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.330 
quite often I dump the ash pan every
couple<00:00:55.800> weeks<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:57.890> clean<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> eat

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
couple weeks and I clean it when I eat

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
couple weeks and I clean it when I eat
when<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> let<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.780> clean<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> ash

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
when I let it go out I clean up the ash

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
when I let it go out I clean up the ash
pan<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.010> clean<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> whole<00:01:02.760> stove<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.329> every<00:01:03.989> two

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
pan I clean the whole stove on every two

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
pan I clean the whole stove on every two
weeks<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.580> takes<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.939> half

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
weeks or so probably takes about a half

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
weeks or so probably takes about a half
an<00:01:06.360> hour<00:01:06.479> 45<00:01:07.020> minutes<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.860> cleaned<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
an hour 45 minutes but I I cleaned the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
an hour 45 minutes but I I cleaned the
baffles<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.810> runs<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.560> peak

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
baffles so that it runs at peak

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
baffles so that it runs at peak

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.160 
checked when I had like five eighths of
a<00:01:51.570> tank<00:01:51.840> left

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
a tank left

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
a tank left
that's<00:01:52.320> after<00:01:52.619> four<00:01:52.950> years<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.659> burn<00:01:55.020> fuel

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that's after four years and I burn fuel

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
that's after four years and I burn fuel
oil<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> three<00:01:56.340> dollars<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.210> better<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
oil which is three dollars or better a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.950 
oil which is three dollars or better a
gallon<00:01:58.439> four<00:01:58.829> dollars<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> gallon<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.930> when<00:02:00.930> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
gallon four dollars a gallon and when I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.170 
gallon four dollars a gallon and when I
didn't<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> pellet<00:02:01.950> stove<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.969> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
didn't have the pellet stove I would go

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
didn't have the pellet stove I would go
through<00:02:03.450> probably<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.290> tanks<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> year<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
through probably two tanks a year and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.770 
through probably two tanks a year and
that's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.869> 275<00:02:07.710> gallon<00:02:08.069> tank<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.000> four<00:02:09.330> dollars

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that's a 275 gallon tank so four dollars

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
that's a 275 gallon tank so four dollars
you<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:11.009> would<00:02:11.129> probably<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.520> close<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you know that would probably be close to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.059 
you know that would probably be close to
$2,000

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
$2,000

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.000 
$2,000
and<00:02:13.219> I<00:02:13.670> spent<00:02:14.060> 800<00:02:14.629> for<00:02:14.780> pellets<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.829> either

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and I spent 800 for pellets it's either

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.660 
and I spent 800 for pellets it's either
800<00:02:16.579> for<00:02:16.670> pellets<00:02:17.000> or<00:02:17.260> 2,000<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.379> fuel<00:02:18.560> oil<00:02:18.769> so

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
800 for pellets or 2,000 for fuel oil so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.209 
800 for pellets or 2,000 for fuel oil so
that's<00:02:19.989> pretty<00:02:20.989> simple<00:02:21.290> even<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.859> can<00:02:22.040> figure

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
that's pretty simple even I can figure

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.140 
that's pretty simple even I can figure
that<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.609> out<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.060> also<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.519> pellet<00:02:25.519> grill
