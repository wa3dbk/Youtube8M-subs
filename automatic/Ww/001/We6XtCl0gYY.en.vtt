00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there's no point to them really the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
there's no point to them really the
biggest<00:00:32.700> point<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.410> best<00:00:34.559> sound

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

that<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.250> possibly<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:41.899> sound<00:00:42.899> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that you can possibly have sound on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.850 
that you can possibly have sound on
these<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:44.000> really<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.050> amazing

and i believe that i was reading some
reviews<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.460> them<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.030> were<00:00:51.090> saying

reviews on them and they were saying

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.189 
reviews on them and they were saying

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that basically they are there about

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
that basically they are there about
three<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.559> four<00:00:55.680> hundred<00:00:55.829> dollars<00:00:56.010> for

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
three or four hundred dollars for

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119 
three or four hundred dollars for
headphones<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.680> almost<00:00:58.680> identical

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
headphones but they are almost identical

basically how it works is I'm going to
put<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.060> huge

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
put them on is that you have these huge

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.950 
put them on is that you have these huge
many<00:01:29.549> speakers<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.150> guess<00:01:30.329> he's<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> phone

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
many speakers I guess he's the phone

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
many speakers I guess he's the phone
part<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.009> headphones<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.450> they

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
part of the headphones and they they

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
part of the headphones and they they
work<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:34.979> fit<00:01:35.520> around

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
work so that they actually fit around

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390 
work so that they actually fit around
the<00:01:36.119> ear<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:36.990> they're<00:01:37.170> huge<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the ear as you can see they're huge so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
the ear as you can see they're huge so
instead<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.150> directly<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.259> ear

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
when you use these you get the quite

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
when you use these you get the quite
possibly<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> purest<00:01:51.500> music

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
possibly one of some of the purest music

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
possibly one of some of the purest music
experiences<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.310> will<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.610> with

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
experiences you will have with

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
experiences you will have with
headphones<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
headphones but if you look at it it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.319 
headphones but if you look at it it
really<00:01:56.159> does<00:01:56.430> take<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.000> space<00:01:57.299> on

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
really does take up a lot of space on

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
really does take up a lot of space on
the<00:01:57.540> side<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.869> head<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.920> everything

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about the the sound every sort of wave

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.340 
about the the sound every sort of wave
link<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:03.000> precisely<00:02:03.630> where<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> needs<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
link is just precisely where it needs to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.150 
link is just precisely where it needs to
be

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.190 

now<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.210> look<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:14.330> will<00:02:15.330> look<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.960> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
now the look of this will look of it and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
now the look of this will look of it and
the<00:02:16.770> quality<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> sound<00:02:17.850> kind<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.240> fit

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the quality of the sound kind of fit

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.630 
the quality of the sound kind of fit
into<00:02:18.510> each<00:02:18.690> other<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.020> these<00:02:19.140> arches<00:02:20.010> right

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
into each other with these arches right

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.760 
into each other with these arches right
here<00:02:20.970> basically<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.080> they're<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.470> cord

little bit warm if have to take them off
just<00:03:32.910> cool<00:03:33.209> down<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.420> little<00:03:33.600> bit<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:33.900> these

just cool down a little bit but these

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.080 
just cool down a little bit but these
definitely<00:03:34.740> take<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> pressure<00:03:35.520> off<00:03:35.730> quite<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
definitely take the pressure off quite a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.199 
definitely take the pressure off quite a
bit<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.650> they<00:03:37.650> are<00:03:37.800> also<00:03:38.010> how<00:03:38.580> your<00:03:38.760> head<00:03:38.910> fits

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
into them and that's quite an ingenious

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.510 
into them and that's quite an ingenious
design<00:03:41.850> right<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.239> it's<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.570> simple<00:03:42.900> and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
design right there it's so simple and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.580 
design right there it's so simple and
you<00:03:44.520> know<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.120> works<00:03:45.720> really<00:03:46.050> well<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
you know it just works really well and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.290 
you know it just works really well and
obviously<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.610> what<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.820> arches<00:03:48.180> and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
obviously you know what the arches and

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.810 
obviously you know what the arches and
why<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:49.260> have<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.770> big<00:03:50.190> arch<00:03:50.520> right

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.710 
looked at myself in the mirror when I
was<00:03:59.130> wearing<00:03:59.340> these<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.640> I<00:04:00.000> was<00:04:00.690> just

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
was wearing these and I was just

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.710 
was wearing these and I was just
thinking<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:02.090> not<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.330> wear<00:04:03.480> these<00:04:03.570> on

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
thinking I not going to wear these on

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.390 
thinking I not going to wear these on
the<00:04:03.810> bus<00:04:04.020> or<00:04:04.320> anything<00:04:04.590> like<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.739> probably

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
the bus or anything like that probably

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.010 
the bus or anything like that probably
the<00:04:05.520> most<00:04:05.940> comfortable<00:04:06.390> headphones<00:04:06.840> I've

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
the most comfortable headphones I've

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.040 
the most comfortable headphones I've
ever<00:04:07.200> ever<00:04:07.380> worn<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.940> going<00:04:09.180> back<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.720> fit

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
ever ever worn now going back to the fit

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.470 
ever ever worn now going back to the fit
and<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.320> shape<00:04:10.860> i<00:04:11.010> guess<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.340> look<00:04:11.550> of<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.820> is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
and the shape i guess the look of it is

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.650 
and the shape i guess the look of it is
that<00:04:13.520> like<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.610> said<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:14.940> comfort<00:04:15.450> is

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that like I said the comfort is

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.349 
that like I said the comfort is
definitely<00:04:16.650> worth<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.459> look<00:04:17.609> goofy<00:04:17.850> around

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
definitely worth it to look goofy around

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.110 
definitely worth it to look goofy around
but<00:04:19.200> that's<00:04:19.770> sort<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.280> problem<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:20.970> with

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
but that's sort of a problem for me with

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.780 
but that's sort of a problem for me with
headphones

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
headphones

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.340 
headphones
they<00:04:21.970> have<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.210> fit<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.630> right<00:04:22.780> way<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:22.990> they

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
they have to fit the right way and they

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.230 
they have to fit the right way and they
fit<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.890> ear<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.430> way<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.120> have

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
fit on the ear the right way and I have

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.550 
fit on the ear the right way and I have
to<00:04:25.360> know<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.960> have<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.230> feel<00:04:26.380> comfortable

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
to know that I have to feel comfortable

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.160 
to know that I have to feel comfortable
in<00:04:26.920> knowing<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.000> should<00:04:28.990> there<00:04:29.140> be

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
in knowing that you know should there be

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.170 
in knowing that you know should there be
unexpected<00:04:30.100> movements<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:30.700> my<00:04:30.850> head<00:04:31.060> they're

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
unexpected movements but my head they're

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.360 
unexpected movements but my head they're
not<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.540> fly<00:04:31.780> off<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.470> know<00:04:32.590> do

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
not going to fly off or you know do

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.280 
not going to fly off or you know do
anything<00:04:34.000> weird<00:04:34.360> around<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.780> ears<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.170> have

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
anything weird around the ears that have

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.500 
anything weird around the ears that have
to<00:04:35.410> readjust<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:36.730> that's<00:04:36.850> what<00:04:37.150> these<00:04:37.360> do

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
to readjust them so that's what these do

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.300 
to readjust them so that's what these do
really<00:04:37.810> well<00:04:37.930> it's<00:04:38.170> kind<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.920> pillow

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
really well it's kind of like a pillow

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.790 
really well it's kind of like a pillow
comfort<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:40.480> me<00:04:40.690> when<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.290> put<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.680> they

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
comfort to me when you put in you they

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.900 
comfort to me when you put in you they
don't<00:04:41.980> really<00:04:42.070> look<00:04:42.280> like<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.670> but<00:04:42.730> when<00:04:42.850> you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
don't really look like it but when you

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.420 
don't really look like it but when you
put<00:04:42.940> them<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.380> there<00:04:44.380> they're<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:45.130> very

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
put them on there they're really very

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.760 
put them on there they're really very
light<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.660> would<00:04:46.990> think<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.350> they

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
light and so you would think that they

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.350 
light and so you would think that they
would<00:04:47.800> kind<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.130> fly<00:04:48.370> off<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:48.790> easily<00:04:48.970> but

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
would kind of fly off very easily but

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.520 
would kind of fly off very easily but
you<00:04:50.140> know<00:04:50.230> they<00:04:50.470> stay<00:04:50.980> in<00:04:51.010> place<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.810> that's<00:04:53.140> my

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
you know they stay in place so that's my

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.190 
you know they stay in place so that's my
review<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:54.010> them<00:04:54.460> they<00:04:54.670> fit<00:04:55.240> very<00:04:55.270> well<00:04:55.750> around

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
review on them they fit very well around

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.830 
review on them they fit very well around
my<00:04:56.350> head<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.010> sound<00:04:57.310> quality<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.730> amazing<00:04:58.060> to

my head the sound quality is amazing to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.020 
my head the sound quality is amazing to
me<00:04:58.870> at<00:04:59.140> least<00:04:59.290> like<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.070> sound<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.490> an<00:05:00.610> expert
