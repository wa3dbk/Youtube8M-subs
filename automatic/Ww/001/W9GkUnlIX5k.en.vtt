00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.520 
this is option two I really like the
shape<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.870> don't<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.320> about

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
shape of these but I don't know about

shape of these but I don't know about
the<00:01:28.770> color<00:01:28.980> again<00:01:29.370> this<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:30.890> sort<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the color again this is a sort of a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.300 
the color again this is a sort of a
lightish<00:01:32.400> green<00:01:33.290> okay<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:34.830> option

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
lightish green okay so that is option

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.340 
lightish green okay so that is option
two<00:01:40.220> these<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.400> no<00:01:41.430> particular<00:01:41.670> order

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
two these are in no particular order

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
two these are in no particular order
this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> option<00:01:43.860> 3<00:01:43.910> this<00:01:44.910> is<00:01:44.970> sort<00:01:45.300> of<00:01:45.330> an

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this is option 3 this is sort of an

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
this is option 3 this is sort of an
amber<00:01:45.810> color<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:48.950> hope<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.250> too<00:01:50.400> much

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
amber color I hope there's not too much

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.430 
amber color I hope there's not too much
glare<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.110> Amber

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
glare so it's like an Amber

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.530 
glare so it's like an Amber
tortoiseshell<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.910> little<00:01:54.150> bit

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
tortoiseshell you know it's a little bit

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.109 
tortoiseshell you know it's a little bit
irregular<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
irregular and I think that these are the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.790 
irregular and I think that these are the
same<00:01:57.360> exact<00:01:57.660> shape<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.200> green<00:01:58.380> ones<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
same exact shape is the green ones I

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.999 
same exact shape is the green ones I
can't<00:01:59.250> remember<00:01:59.399> now<00:02:00.320> okay<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.680> option

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
can't remember now okay so that's option

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:11.720 
can't remember now okay so that's option
three<00:02:08.360> these<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.950> sort<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.190> burgundy<00:02:11.640> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
three these are sort of a burgundy at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.490 
three these are sort of a burgundy at
the<00:02:11.820> top<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> phase<00:02:12.690> into<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.290> sort

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the top and then it phase into just sort

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
the top and then it phase into just sort
of<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.650> brown<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.459> color<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
of a brown the color is going to be

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.810 
of a brown the color is going to be
pretty<00:02:15.270> hard<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.570> tell<00:02:15.810> i<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.410> um<00:02:16.820> it's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
pretty hard to tell i think but um it's

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.110 
pretty hard to tell i think but um it's
just<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.420> little<00:02:18.720> bit<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.670> burgundy<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> top

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
just a little bit of burgundy at the top

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.540 
just a little bit of burgundy at the top
and<00:02:21.570> these<00:02:22.260> are<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> bit<00:02:22.650> smaller<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.220> they

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
and these are a bit smaller I think they

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.310 
and these are a bit smaller I think they
have<00:02:23.580> their<00:02:24.060> less<00:02:24.270> wide<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.410> option<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:30.320> and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
have their less wide so option for and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.170 
have their less wide so option for and
the<00:02:31.650> last<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.100> these<00:02:32.250> are<00:02:32.310> sort<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.030> classic

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the last one these are sort of a classic

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.170 
the last one these are sort of a classic
tortoiseshell<00:02:37.010> option<00:02:38.010> five<00:02:41.000> these<00:02:42.000> are

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
tortoiseshell option five these are

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
tortoiseshell option five these are
pretty<00:02:42.390> similar<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> something<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.320> had<00:02:43.560> before

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
