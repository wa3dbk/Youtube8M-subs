00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
recently posted up a tutorial about how

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.820 
recently posted up a tutorial about how
to<00:00:23.260> control<00:00:23.710> recoil<00:00:23.920> on<00:00:24.369> PC<00:00:24.880> with<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.600> mouse

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to control recoil on PC with the mouse

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.620 
to control recoil on PC with the mouse
it's<00:00:26.830> a<00:00:26.920> pretty<00:00:27.100> simple<00:00:27.369> concept<00:00:27.670> you<00:00:28.450> move

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
it's a pretty simple concept you move

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's a pretty simple concept you move
the<00:00:28.779> mouse<00:00:28.930> in<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.260> opposite<00:00:29.680> direction<00:00:29.830> of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the mouse in the opposite direction of

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.400 
the mouse in the opposite direction of
the<00:00:30.369> upward<00:00:30.820> recoil<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.450> this<00:00:31.869> counteracts

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
the upward recoil and this counteracts

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.710 
the upward recoil and this counteracts
the<00:00:32.529> upward<00:00:32.890> effect<00:00:33.280> leading<00:00:33.970> to<00:00:34.180> type<00:00:34.390> bullet

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
the upward effect leading to type bullet

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
to film this while playing and I got to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.200 
to film this while playing and I got to
tell<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:26.590> pretty<00:01:26.830> interesting<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.880> see

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
tell you it's pretty interesting to see

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.180 
tell you it's pretty interesting to see
what<00:01:28.540> my<00:01:28.660> hands<00:01:28.840> look<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.290> when<00:01:29.800> playing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
what my hands look like when playing

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.520 
what my hands look like when playing
especially<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:31.210> situations<00:01:31.420> where<00:01:32.140> they're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
especially in situations where they're

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.680 
especially in situations where they're
pretty<00:01:32.860> intense<00:01:33.220> or<00:01:33.550> havend<00:01:34.240> rental<00:01:34.600> and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
pretty intense or havend rental and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.840 
pretty intense or havend rental and
pumping<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.440> order<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.130> counteract<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
pumping in order to counteract the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.180 
pumping in order to counteract the
upward<00:01:37.240> recoil<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.440> slight<00:01:38.950> nudge

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
upward recoil you do a slight nudge

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.100 
upward recoil you do a slight nudge
downwards<00:01:39.760> for<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.150> duration<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.840> burst

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
downwards for the duration of the burst

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.350 
downwards for the duration of the burst
this<00:01:42.010> will<00:01:42.220> help<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.550> kill<00:01:42.790> fast<00:01:43.090> without

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
this will help you kill fast without

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.900 
this will help you kill fast without
having<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.170> waste<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.680> clip<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.280> kill<00:01:45.640> somebody

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
having to waste a clip to kill somebody

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.370 
having to waste a clip to kill somebody
which<00:01:46.270> really<00:01:46.510> helps<00:01:46.840> when<00:01:46.990> dealing<00:01:47.200> with

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
which really helps when dealing with

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.800 
which really helps when dealing with
multiple<00:01:48.040> targets<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.240> amount<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.660> will

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
multiple targets the amount you will

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.630 
multiple targets the amount you will
have<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.080> compensate<00:01:50.440> varies<00:01:51.040> depending<00:01:51.520> on

have to compensate varies depending on
the<00:01:51.700> weapon<00:01:52.090> use<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:53.170> suggest<00:01:53.650> you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
the weapon use and I suggest you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.500 
the weapon use and I suggest you
practice<00:01:54.220> with<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.580> weapon<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.030> order<00:01:55.390> to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
practice with the weapon in order to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.560 
practice with the weapon in order to
implement<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.230> into<00:01:56.560> your<00:01:56.650> game<00:01:56.890> style

this<00:02:00.610> comes<00:02:00.880> as<00:02:01.090> second<00:02:01.480> nature<00:02:02.130> although<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
this comes as second nature although it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.550 
this comes as second nature although it
will<00:02:03.730> never<00:02:03.970> look<00:02:04.240> as<00:02:04.390> smooth<00:02:04.690> as<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.200> does<00:02:05.380> on

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
will never look as smooth as it does on

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.249 
will never look as smooth as it does on
PC<00:02:06.040> due<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.400> things<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.360> low<00:02:07.600> 30<00:02:07.930> frames

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
PC due to things like the low 30 frames

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.889 
PC due to things like the low 30 frames
per<00:02:08.379> second<00:02:08.979> we<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> mouse<00:02:10.690> is

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
per second we have and that a mouse is

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.899 
per second we have and that a mouse is
just<00:02:11.140> all-around<00:02:11.319> better<00:02:11.709> for<00:02:12.010> aiming<00:02:12.370> one

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
just all-around better for aiming one

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.790 
just all-around better for aiming one
thing<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.239> largely<00:02:13.690> affects<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:14.349> accuracy

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
thing that largely affects your accuracy

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.119 
thing that largely affects your accuracy
and<00:02:15.220> ability<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.000> aim<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.420> game<00:02:16.750> lag<00:02:17.129> basically

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
and ability to aim is game lag basically

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.220 
and ability to aim is game lag basically
game<00:02:18.400> lag<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.090> delay<00:02:19.390> between<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:19.959> you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
game lag is the delay between when you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
game lag is the delay between when you
make<00:02:20.409> an<00:02:20.560> input<00:02:20.980> into<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> game<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.849> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
make an input into the game and the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.410 
make an input into the game and the
input<00:02:22.510> actually<00:02:22.689> showing<00:02:23.230> up<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.530> your<00:02:23.680> TV

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
input actually showing up on your TV

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.000 
input actually showing up on your TV
obviously<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.599> want<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.870> TV<00:02:26.079> with<00:02:26.409> as<00:02:26.590> little

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
obviously you want a TV with as little

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.850 
obviously you want a TV with as little
game<00:02:27.219> lag<00:02:27.430> as

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
game lag as

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.310 
game lag as
or<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.120> has<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.270> game<00:02:29.570> mode<00:02:29.810> be<00:02:30.020> sure<00:02:30.200> to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
or if it has a game mode be sure to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.590 
or if it has a game mode be sure to
enable<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:30.890> another<00:02:31.490> remedy<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:32.120> finding<00:02:32.570> your

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
enable it another remedy is finding your

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.350 
enable it another remedy is finding your
TV's<00:02:33.200> native<00:02:33.800> resolution<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.670> playing<00:02:35.060> on

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
TV's native resolution and playing on

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
TV's native resolution and playing on
that<00:02:35.870> resolution<00:02:37.720> but<00:02:38.720> as<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.960> can<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.170> I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that resolution but as you can see I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.340 
that resolution but as you can see I
demonstrated<00:02:40.070> right<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:41.050> what<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.140> looks

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
demonstrated right here what it looks

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.230 
demonstrated right here what it looks
like<00:02:42.530> when<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.830> do<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.100> full<00:02:43.460> burst<00:02:43.640> without

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
like when I do a full burst without

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660 
like when I do a full burst without
recoil<00:02:44.900> compensation<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.740> then<00:02:45.980> doing<00:02:46.460> it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
recoil compensation and then doing it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.610 
recoil compensation and then doing it
with<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.150> recoil<00:02:47.450> compensation<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.410> it's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
with the recoil compensation and it's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.890 
with the recoil compensation and it's
just<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.950> slight<00:02:49.220> nudge<00:02:49.400> downwards<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.360> like

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
just a slight nudge downwards just like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.680 
just a slight nudge downwards just like
you<00:02:51.020> would<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.650> PC<00:02:52.130> mouse<00:02:52.420> another<00:02:53.420> thing

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
you would with a PC mouse another thing

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.270 
you would with a PC mouse another thing
you<00:02:53.810> want<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.050> do<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.350> play<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.740> sensitivity

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
you want to do is play on a sensitivity

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.580 
you want to do is play on a sensitivity
that<00:02:55.520> best<00:02:55.910> suits<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.720> setting<00:02:57.350> where<00:02:57.500> you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
that best suits you a setting where you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.350 
that best suits you a setting where you
can<00:02:57.620> remain<00:02:57.980> formidable<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.730> close<00:02:58.940> quarters

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
can remain formidable in close quarters

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360 
can remain formidable in close quarters
and<00:02:59.540> maintain<00:03:00.020> control<00:03:00.380> at<00:03:00.620> longer<00:03:00.830> ranges

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
and maintain control at longer ranges

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.180 
and maintain control at longer ranges
mine<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.420> particularly<00:03:02.900> low<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:03.980> most

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
mine is particularly low for most

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.250 
mine is particularly low for most
players<00:03:04.460> it's<00:03:04.910> about<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.420> third<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.110> way

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
players it's about one third up the way

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.920 
players it's about one third up the way
but<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:06.770> how<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.040> like<00:03:07.340> mine<00:03:07.690> another<00:03:08.690> thing

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
but that's how I like mine another thing

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.510 
but that's how I like mine another thing

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
if at all possible I really do feel it

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.550 
if at all possible I really do feel it
