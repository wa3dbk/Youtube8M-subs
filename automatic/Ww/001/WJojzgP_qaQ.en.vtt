00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 Thank you 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.940
 today we are going to prepare a three-course pizza 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.940
 cheeses 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.559
 this time we are going to prepare a 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.720
 rich soft pizza full of flavor in the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.970
 that we will use three types of cheese 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.970
 is rich rich 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.140
 we will start preparing the dough for 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.689
 we dilute the yeast in 300 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.939
 milliliters of water we will use water to 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.699
 room temperature we add a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.589
 teaspoon of sugar and stir the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.969
 sugar will serve as a yeast element and 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.270
 It will help us to make it a mass 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.460
 fluffy and soft 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.670
 we put the flour in a bowl and add 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.469
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.469
 we mix lightly and you're 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 and we will continue adding the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.890
 yeast little by little we squirt and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.890
 stir with a spoon 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.460
 you see you stay in a bowl is much more 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.460
 cleansed 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.100
 we will add the water and mix until 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.720
 that a uniform mass remains 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.130
 to make this kind of dough 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.130
 we will use force flour 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 well now let's knead for it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 we dip our hands in olive oil and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 the work surface 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 this will help us to make a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.050
 first kneading and at the same time that the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 oil is integrated into the mass 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.340
 pour the dough and knead for about 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.340
 34 minutes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.900
 then knead with flour 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 we will spend another 45 minutes stretching and 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.520
 taking the dough continuously 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.189
 a few taps 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.330
 you will be checking that little by little they are going 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.720
 releasing the dough was leaving more 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.220
 compact and the one that we have kneaded that in 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.769
 total we have amassed about 8 or 10 minutes 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.569
 we put it in a bowl so it does not 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.860
 paste, throw on the flour base or 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.840
 we can also throw a jet of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.510
 oil and we keep it in an area 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.020
 isolated from the cold we will let it rest 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 about 25 30 minutes 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.470
 we take advantage of that type to go preparing 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 part of the ingredients that we are going to 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.230
 to use we will cut in tacos a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 zucchini a couple of tomatoes a few sticks 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 of crab 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.950
 well let's prepare our mass as 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.130
 we are in summer you see that this has 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.750
 I raised a lot 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.260
 and we are going to prepare our base for 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.040
 pizza in flour we work table and 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.040
 pour the dough 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.500
 we divide into two parts 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.360
 with one part I have made the loaves of 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.849
 pizza I leave the link of how it is done 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.920
 at the top of the video and now 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.959
 we extend the other half in this case nor 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.090
 I'm even going to use a roller 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.709
 to stretch it to the palm of your hand 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.780
 We stretch well and place it on a 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.250
 source with baking paper and before 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.489
 continue to preheat the oven 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.069
 at 220 degrees good the time came for 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.930
 prepare our pizza we distribute 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.239
 tomatoes on the base you can use 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.640
 fried tomato or how I made tomato 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.140
 crushed natural 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.050
 then we take a layer of 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.420
 mozzarella 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.010
 and we distribute the zucchini 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.010
 we do the same with the tomato 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.280
 we continue with the crab sticks 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.170
 and the ham taquitos serrano 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.020
 we distribute everything evenly 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.209
 and the other cheeses that we suffered cheese 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.430
 cool philadelphia or mascarpone type and 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.690
 a few taquitos of cheese semicurado if os 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.270
 they like stronger flavors you can 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.260
 use cheddar cheese or blue cheese 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.930
 good and we go to the oven 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.920
 bake we have 220 degrees about 12 15 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.630
 minutes 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.550
 this dough that we have used is very 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.620
 versatile and can be used to make 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.329
 pizza to make the coca and how it has 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.870
 said before to make the Arabic bread or 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.870
