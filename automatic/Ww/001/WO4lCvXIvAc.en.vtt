00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
long and that was my argument was my

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
long and that was my argument was my
other<00:03:12.150> video<00:03:12.420> at<00:03:12.630> maybe<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.230> two<00:03:13.410> years<00:03:13.830> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040
