00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.390
 thank you for joining us in seeing and believing 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 you and I are people but what do you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 it sounds if I tell you that God is a person and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.900
 that angels are also people 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.190
 what do I say this 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.440
 in the next note I explain it to you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.790
 only humans also god 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.320
 the angels and the deceased are 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.320
 people look why 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 God is a person because the divine person 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.470
 is a subject in corpore or not created and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.680
 Creator is a person because he is pure 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.260
 intelligence and pure that reflective god 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.050
 is the first person since he is the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 reason for the being of the unity of kindness 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.240
 and the beauty of all things 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 God is a person because he tunes in 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 the angelic people and with the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 human beings as God is spirit 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.039
 spirit means communication and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.440
 activity without limits the spirit 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.380
 penetrates the deepest chasms of 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.649
 the reality opens it communicates and it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 delivery is incorruptible is immaterial and 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.649
 this is why immortal angels are 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.009
 people because every angel is a subject 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.080
 incorporeal and created is a person since it is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.420
 a spiritual creature that can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.179
 tune in with another angelic person 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 with human persons and with the 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.520
 divine person thanks to the power of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 intelligence and reflective will 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 good angels are people 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.469
 and created that positively influence 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 our spirit inclining us to a 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.750
 union life in which you are 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.929
 our realization the evil angels 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.120
 they are disembodied and created people who 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.090
 negatively influence our 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.849
 spirit inclining us to a life of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.090
 division in which is our 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.549
 I fail the angels because they are people 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.140
 can interact with the human being that 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.140
 he is also a person 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.550
 ah
