good morning folks we're going to start

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.720 
good morning folks we're going to start
with<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.770> story<00:00:02.100> about<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> United

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
with this story about how the United

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.880 
with this story about how the United
States<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.330> not<00:00:03.750> thinking<00:00:04.170> much<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.589> Iran's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
States is not thinking much of Iran's

nuclear<00:00:05.190> announcements<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.089> guess<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.660> means

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
nuclear announcements I guess this means

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.570 
nuclear announcements I guess this means
they<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.200> stop<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> war<00:00:07.770> propaganda<00:00:08.010> right

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
they can stop the war propaganda right

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.839 
they can stop the war propaganda right
we<00:00:09.540> wish<00:00:09.780> coming<00:00:10.769> over<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> RSO<00:00:11.519> II<00:00:11.550> there

earth now despite the fact that our
magnetosphere<00:01:12.479> took<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> whack<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.830> our

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
magnetosphere took a whack so did our

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.440 
magnetosphere took a whack so did our

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
f2 layer and you don't see anything high
whatsoever<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.369> expect<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.970> higher

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
whatsoever we would expect much higher

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
whatsoever we would expect much higher
ionizations<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.619> either<00:01:38.460> our

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
ionizations than this so either our

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
ionizations than this so either our
magnetic<00:01:39.869> field<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.710> block<00:01:41.100> away<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
magnetic field really did block away a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.929 
magnetic field really did block away a
vast<00:01:42.570> amount<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.049> energy<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.549> energy<00:01:44.909> has

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
vast amount of energy or that energy has

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.910 
vast amount of energy or that energy has
already<00:01:45.240> been<00:01:45.479> inducted<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> earth<00:01:46.680> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
already been inducted into the earth we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
already been inducted into the earth we
do<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.520> ionosphere<00:01:47.880> did<00:01:48.240> absorb

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
do know that the ionosphere did absorb

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
do know that the ionosphere did absorb
quite<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> flurry

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
quite a bit of it so if we get a flurry

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.160 
quite a bit of it so if we get a flurry
of<00:01:50.640> large<00:01:50.880> quakes<00:01:51.180> today<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
of large quakes today that might be the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
of large quakes today that might be the
case<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.430> possible<00:01:53.820> trick<00:01:54.030> or

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
case that is one possible trick or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.940 
case that is one possible trick or
mechanism<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> certainly<00:01:55.649> not

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
mechanism but it's certainly not

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.899 
mechanism but it's certainly not
absolute<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> news<00:01:57.180> folks<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.719> safe
