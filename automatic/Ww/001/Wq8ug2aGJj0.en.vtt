00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.070
 Well then this camera is called everywhere the influence progressive 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.800
 Being 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.710
 There is a riot 24p 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.529
 3046 people 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 There are 2 types of modes 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.499
 If you have 24 people, it is more than a year ago 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.329
 This time 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.979
 I am glad to see the 3.t that is currently used on TV 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.430
 I think that I achieved using 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.680
 Let your left hand 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.880
 Even if the teacher is in their 60s, 30 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.100
 Hanjihe pta was also for -30p 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.210
 I think change 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 Let's see it first 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.500
 Because it is difficult to improve 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.270
 At this time, the person who narrowed down the image 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.320
 I think it is good because it is already easy to see 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.290
 From the success example 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.330
 New agricultural policy 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.670
 Body 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.180
 Select 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 fm rate 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.320
 A little bit frame rate 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 Mikawa the match 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 Select the menu f in Yamanaka 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 Enough to enter 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 Mitaka 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 2 has become 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 Only from now on 30p- 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.050
 I want to shoot fresh and not 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.090
 As of 5 pm, it is an example of -30 p compared to the previous day 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 Start in this state 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 Somewhat deeper in the strait 2. 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.710
 I wonder if that is the point 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.789
 Air always spikes from 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.819
 Looking at only US economic indicators seems to have obtained a somewhat clear answer 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.799
 It looks like a wind This is only to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 If there is a problem on the screen, for example the Executive Committee 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.589
 When edited 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.149
 The preview screen is 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.399
 Firmly 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.399
 I'm coming to the US 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.749
 The main advantage of Meieki forklift is 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.249
 For example, from here a regular fee will be used for regular inspection at the time 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.979
 I think 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.909
 The amount of information is on the screen 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.909
 Due to the structure of confectionery 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.439
 Be succeeded 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.070
 It is very effective depending on how it is used 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.009
 think 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.849
 Let's have an easy-to-understand 24 page mode 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.980
 Guang Ling high 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.980
 Likewise 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.659
 From the camera menu 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.599
 Enactment of a new law 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.599
 Frame rate 24s 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.689
 choose 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.689
 This is the end 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.589
 Platinum Award and the next twenty-four days 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.849
 It becomes high performance 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849
 Kiyotaka Fujisaki compares with Angeuk 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:21.459
 After all, the mm report leads to more planning 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.829
 I'm sorry, but in the end this is going to intensify competition 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.759
 Are there any problems at the practice area 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.239
 If anything, 24 f reduced 12 yen compared with the day before 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:38.579
 Oh, and lastly the height of hydropower and the mode of the year Keio Otoka and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.899
 There will be no doubt to have 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:45.419
 In particular, to use 25f in English tv is a great rendition 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.139
 I don't use much congratulations 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.579
 It may be coverage 100 people 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.579
 Thirty nine days- 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.169
 Technically 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.889
