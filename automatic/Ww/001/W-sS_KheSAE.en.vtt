00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.120
 not at all 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.849
 hi to all and go bbox for the life of 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.180
 oceans kraft and as you saw 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.980
 in the title how to buy items 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.940
 it is rather buying items with the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 block commands 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.810
 this wooded park not marked like that in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.690
 how to buy 10 items with 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.520
 of the xp there you go see I'm going 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.320
 press the button and presto 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.010
 will pass nothing I asked for a plastron in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.110
 leather I put myself level 2 it can be 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.800
 very useful for some maps and there 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.290
 you see up 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 I liked 18 plastron so how that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.850
 walk all this is pretty simple then 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.670
 first of all you're going to say the give div 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.620
 @ plm there you mark the number 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 of experts you want in a plan 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.810
 we will say 5la you mark the idea and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.070
 after the number of 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.270
 two against two two the number of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.510
 the idea that you basically asked there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.309
 I asked 18 we will put 300 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.610
 normally will be pants and there we 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.180
 will score good like that you will see 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 I said for example 5 level so that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 it's just to have the give on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.790
 break that there it means if I have five 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.230
 level I can see her 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.640
 I mate level 5 4 5 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.740
 there you will see I am new 5 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.810
 I take off my pants am still 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 Level 5 meals from upstream level does 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.820
 level there does not change and so it's a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 little bit but in this case I leave you 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.320
 theme and for example here we put xp less 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.210
 zealous 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.690
 two wings initially mostly 21 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.100
 years but it's not a crl and that 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.150
 2 it is to remove that level 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.830
 was relaxing while raising his tail 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.230
 but play less 5 l 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 @ then month equals up 5 hellemmes between 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.180
 pupils hooks is equal 5 is so there 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.950
 if I support you see I have my 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.350
 pants and it takes away the ancient xp 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.360
 later than if for example I get back 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.630
 my five level that's all I can 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.330
 just lose five lifts so here I 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.160
 can just remove it is lgv 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.800
 have fun on the other hand I can not 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.410
 give enchanted elements and we'll see 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.260
 that in a pro in a future tutorial or 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.920
 maybe in one in the map that there I 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.770
 will introduce you 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.100
 so for now I'm going to create maths 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.780
 which will be based on potions so already 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.319
 to turn it off all that is recovered 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.760
 it 's inch these two positions then 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.319
 there will be two types of potions the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.050
 explosive potions of damage and the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.910
 explosive potions underneath - who will 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.480
 bought by the xp because when you 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.010
 mobs we earn xp thanks to that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.989
 damage pensions will be offered 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.330
 skins are guys gt level 1 class 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.620
 for this mega level 2 we can play 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.640
 potions of the gutters two of the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.450
 he level 2 potions through xp 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.250
 so 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.830
 if you have a name idea because 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.950
 for now I have nothing I do not have 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.780
 no idea it's a little annoying 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.420
 will be a potion he will face 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.900
 let's say a dozen waves to kill 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.150
 all his furniture to with a boss at the end 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.400
 and we 'll only have potions that a weapon 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.620
 maybe some armor that we can 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.180
 buy I do not know then the montage 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.220
 on this map it will be that he will have 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.890
 particularities for example there I can not 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.030
 not kill a zombie with the possible 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.760
 damage means we will have to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.860
 to buy potions power for 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.190
 to be able to do damage to zombies 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.690
 sorry checking the mic the jelly it 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.819
 except that here you see I hurt 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.890
 crest afraid that the creeper if I put it 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.360
 potions of life 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.400
 or what 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.400
 well side there I hurt the skeletons 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.500
 young clash 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.480
 the jelly regen and so it's for 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.459
 able to kill what the zombies he 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.129
 will take all alive and to be able 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.900
 kill up zombies spider will take 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.280
 damage potions so this will be a small 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.379
 little played like this the damage potions 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.060
 level 1 will be free ah yes and you are 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.299
 I killed five more forgiveness modes I 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.220
 would say a level healing potion in 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.440
 may cost only in one in 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.090
 many of course it will take it 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.799
 will need stadiums while said potion 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 high level a further bag 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.599
 a level for example these are 4 potion 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.610
 it will cost three levels and it's because 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.020
 that we can not surf them and so he 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
 will buy them stack and pardon I 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.349
 can give just three positions 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.139
 Level 2 at departure not very expensive 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.849
 but 2 3 it's not very useful so that's it 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.379
 if you have any ideas for this 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.330
 new map that will be released during 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.800
 holidays these videos will resume 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.720
 other lap also because there I have more 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.819
 too much time with classes and all that 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.620
 So here was want to block 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.030
 I hope this video is this tutorial 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.919
 you will like it and we find ourselves in a 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.919
 next video this to him at all
