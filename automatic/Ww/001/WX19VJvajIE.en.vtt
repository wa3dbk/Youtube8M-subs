00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.839
 thats honest she herself climbed I'm not for 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.950
 Nyashnosti set for herself 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.549
 jumped and and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:17.279
 and back two times three here it is then she 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.390
 let's find the depressant to invest in 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.390
 you are not crushed by chance 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.480
 like everywhere I announced that I will now 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 dance on a chair well maybe non-stop 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 simple as in the midst of any song and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.070
 everyone will have to call an ambulance 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.650
 but there is no so that's why those who 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.699
 Now we have entered the stream and I will not be in the chat 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.030
 look unfortunately so if here 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.190
 will be like it is hell and sodomy well then 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.199
 do everything goes 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.930
 how will i watch this every 20 minutes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.670
 maybe who knows I hope in an hour I 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.670
 it's all about stanzyu 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 and and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.350
 and what I wanted to say so far 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 I will not look at the microphone 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.380
 work because I will be without headphones 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.049
 and therefore I will have to play a game on 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
 microphone speaker I put bling bling 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:27.140
 he will be without sound or 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.140
 and I stream myself and hairdo 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.310
 I agree it slept but why 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.600
 so I will not like to sing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.760
 but if I drink you will not be me 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.220
 hear unfortunately but you will see 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:46.259
 how i will dance and i will show 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.259
 remixes so bubububu so you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 so here is why rather than dance I 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.330
 probably switching so now you 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 I do not be bitches is there anyone come 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.979
 see by ask what does not say that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.810
 Tell him that I kind of turned off 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.679
 the microphone is therefore not audible so all 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.679
 from and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 do you really understand what i am saying 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.440
 are afraid
