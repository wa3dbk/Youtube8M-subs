everything<00:02:56.580> he<00:02:56.700> plays<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.269> guess<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> while

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
everything he plays I guess for a while

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.150 
everything he plays I guess for a while
till<00:02:59.040> we<00:02:59.160> de<00:02:59.310> creatures<00:02:59.730> even<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:00.780> had<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
till we de creatures even if we had the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.440 
till we de creatures even if we had the
the<00:03:02.160> stalker<00:03:02.459> down<00:03:02.730> by<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.060> will<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.300> be

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the stalker down by now will you be

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.759 
the stalker down by now will you be
beginning<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.170> something<00:03:04.410> yeah<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.560> if

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
beginning in for something yeah but if

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.050 
beginning in for something yeah but if
we<00:03:04.860> paid<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.280> stalker<00:03:05.519> than<00:03:05.790> he<00:03:05.910> would<00:03:06.000> have

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
we paid the stalker than he would have

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.660 
we paid the stalker than he would have
another<00:03:06.390> blyton<00:03:06.750> deja<00:03:06.930> oh<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.340> guess

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
another blyton deja oh that's so I guess

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.660 
another blyton deja oh that's so I guess
it<00:03:08.900> yeah<00:03:09.900> keep<00:03:10.500> countering<00:03:10.950> your<00:03:10.980> guys<00:03:11.250> he's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it yeah keep countering your guys he's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.400 
it yeah keep countering your guys he's
probably<00:03:11.820> just<00:03:11.970> leading<00:03:12.630> up<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> skitter

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
probably just leading up like a skitter

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.900 
probably just leading up like a skitter
exert<00:03:13.769> something<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.310> be<00:03:14.400> my<00:03:14.550> guess<00:03:14.760> if

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
exert something would be my guess if

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.190 
exert something would be my guess if
he's<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.209> walking<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.870> these<00:03:15.989> things

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
he's just walking all of these things

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.809 
he's just walking all of these things
into<00:03:16.350> men<00:03:16.590> leaks

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.160 

next<00:03:22.819> turn<00:03:22.910> he<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:23.240> he<00:03:23.390> plays<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.600> land<00:03:23.870> he<00:03:24.020> can

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
next turn he if he plays a land he can

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.660 
next turn he if he plays a land he can
play<00:03:24.290> plague<00:03:24.590> stingers<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.040> bladed<00:03:25.310> agents

yeah we getting really flooded here it's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.020 
yeah we getting really flooded here it's
not<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.030> because<00:03:38.330> we're<00:03:38.630> islands<00:03:39.170> zing<00:03:43.030> yeah

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
not just because we're islands zing yeah

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.800 
not just because we're islands zing yeah
here<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:44.480> go

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 

and<00:03:51.989> hopefully<00:03:52.349> just<00:03:52.620> taps<00:03:52.860> up<00:03:52.980> force<00:03:53.130> killer

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and hopefully just taps up force killer

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.460 
and hopefully just taps up force killer
is<00:03:53.489> offering<00:03:54.030> ginger<00:03:54.360> spike<00:03:54.599> that's<00:03:55.349> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
is offering ginger spike that's the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.900 
is offering ginger spike that's the
reason<00:03:55.739> we<00:03:55.830> kept<00:03:56.010> Menelik<00:03:56.459> instead<00:03:56.819> of

it's<00:06:00.180> not<00:06:00.360> maybe<00:06:01.259> we<00:06:01.319> should<00:06:01.469> just<00:06:01.580> one<00:06:02.580> get

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
it's not maybe we should just one get

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.239 
it's not maybe we should just one get
rid<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.360> one<00:06:03.599> disperse<00:06:04.139> instead<00:06:04.860> of<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.069> seal

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:05.249 
rid of one disperse instead of the seal

sabotage<00:06:05.869> actually<00:06:06.869> butcher's<00:06:07.139> cleaver<00:06:07.229> just

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
sabotage actually butcher's cleaver just

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.290 
sabotage actually butcher's cleaver just
really<00:06:07.889> bad<00:06:08.039> because<00:06:08.399> it's<00:06:08.729> just<00:06:08.759> basically<00:06:09.180> a

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
really bad because it's just basically a

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.359 
really bad because it's just basically a
worse<00:06:09.809> version<00:06:09.930> of<00:06:10.319> silver<00:06:10.619> inlaid<00:06:10.919> dagger<00:06:11.249> in

worse version of silver inlaid dagger in
this<00:06:11.520> in<00:06:11.819> this<00:06:11.939> matchup<00:06:12.379> it<00:06:13.379> does<00:06:13.529> absolutely

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
this in this matchup it does absolutely

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.200 
this in this matchup it does absolutely
nothing<00:06:14.039> else<00:06:14.430> because<00:06:14.669> we<00:06:14.819> don't<00:06:14.999> care<00:06:15.180> about

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
nothing else because we don't care about

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.519 
nothing else because we don't care about
life<00:06:15.509> link<00:06:15.719> should<00:06:16.110> we<00:06:16.169> should<00:06:16.349> have<00:06:16.439> just

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
life link should we should have just

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.260 
life link should we should have just
taken<00:06:16.649> all<00:06:16.919> of<00:06:16.949> them<00:06:17.129> out<00:06:17.249> so<00:06:17.879> we<00:06:17.969> can<00:06:18.029> at<00:06:18.149> least

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
taken all of them out so we can at least

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.239 
taken all of them out so we can at least
put<00:06:18.509> in<00:06:18.629> one<00:06:18.930> steal<00:06:19.289> sabotage<00:06:19.770> because<00:06:20.129> of

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:20.249 
put in one steal sabotage because of

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.489 
put in one steal sabotage because of
that<00:06:20.399> yeah<00:06:20.990> and<00:06:23.689> can<00:06:24.689> take<00:06:24.839> out<00:06:24.960> a<00:06:24.990> negate

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:25.499 
that yeah and can take out a negate

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:28.959 
that yeah and can take out a negate
since<00:06:26.219> that's<00:06:26.610> when<00:06:26.939> the<00:06:27.210> gate<00:06:27.360> counters<00:06:27.749> is<00:06:27.990> a

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
since that's when the gate counters is a

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.779 
since that's when the gate counters is a
is<00:06:29.969> a<00:06:30.029> pump<00:06:30.689> spells<00:06:30.960> is<00:06:31.529> curiosity<00:06:32.009> is<00:06:32.759> that

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
is a pump spells is curiosity is that

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.639 
is a pump spells is curiosity is that
essential<00:06:33.330> yeah<00:06:33.569> AFC<00:06:34.080> is<00:06:34.139> good<00:06:34.349> because<00:06:34.559> it

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
lets us get ahead if we get it on a

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.909 
lets us get ahead if we get it on a
invisible<00:06:36.509> soccer<00:06:36.839> maybe<00:06:37.469> we<00:06:37.529> just<00:06:37.680> have<00:06:37.800> one

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
invisible soccer maybe we just have one

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.609 
invisible soccer maybe we just have one
steal<00:06:38.159> sabotage<00:06:38.659> I<00:06:39.659> should<00:06:40.050> be<00:06:40.139> fine<00:06:40.349> then<00:06:40.529> we

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:40.619 
steal sabotage I should be fine then we

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.109 
steal sabotage I should be fine then we
have<00:06:40.740> dispersed<00:06:41.159> negate<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:41.819> steal

00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:42.119 
have dispersed negate and steal

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.699 
have dispersed negate and steal
sabotages<00:06:42.779> ways<00:06:42.930> to<00:06:43.169> deal<00:06:43.319> with<00:06:43.439> his<00:06:43.559> room
