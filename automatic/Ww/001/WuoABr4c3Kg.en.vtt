00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
different it's a really amazing pile up

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.279 
different it's a really amazing pile up
spot<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> Goliath<00:00:23.730> Goliath<00:00:24.630> piled

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
spot all the Goliath Goliath piled

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
spot all the Goliath Goliath piled
everything<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.160> juggernaut<00:00:26.670> glass

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
everything the juggernaut glass

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.960 
everything the juggernaut glass
everything<00:00:27.539> piles<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.070> literally

everything piles up so it's literally
the<00:00:30.240> best<00:00:30.810> glitch<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> would<00:00:32.250> suggest

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the best glitch and I would suggest

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.000 
the best glitch and I would suggest
getting<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.149> em1<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.380> unlimited

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
getting the em1 because it has unlimited

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
getting the em1 because it has unlimited
ammo<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.719> straight<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
ammo so let's go straight up into the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
ammo so let's go straight up into the
glitch<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.030> basically<00:00:39.329> got

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
glitch and how to do it so basically got

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.740 
glitch and how to do it so basically got
