00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and I will be running benchmarks on this

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.820 
and I will be running benchmarks on this
let<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.340> guys<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.730> how<00:03:44.910> fast<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.830> so

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
let you guys know how fast this is so

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.380 
let you guys know how fast this is so
