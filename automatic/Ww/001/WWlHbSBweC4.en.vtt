00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hi everyone google no video for the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.000
 nail art collection in this video vi 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.710
 I'll show you how to make this nail 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 art that has a bit of a particular where 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.900
 we have the sponge effect technique 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.330
 together with the east river and the micro pearls 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.039
 follow the tutorial 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 first of all if we give a base the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 we spread monocolor on all nails 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 the base still serves to protect 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 the nail from the color and next that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.800
 we are going to use for not doing 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 stain the nail and each base to different 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.250
 functions and bases, however, dry 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250
 really very fast 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.530
 now let's take a green stand we give to 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.570
 single color on all nails we give 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.550
 very subtle passages because not 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.410
 there is so much problem we will give two one 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.790
 thin layer that covers the tip well 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.980
 because we don't have to see the double 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.850
 color between one state and another 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.590
 expect the enamel to dry 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.510
 completely after the second pass 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.129
 we wait at least a quarter of an hour before 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.960
 to proceed with the mail art 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.730
 and very important to be able to wait for 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.170
 possible time not to spoil 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.239
 then of course the decor that we will go to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.890
 realize if by chance there are some 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.360
 inaccuracies don't worry because 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.949
 we can take a correcting pen 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140
 enamel or a cotton or even drunk 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.670
 of solvent and clean the spot where 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.670
 we were wrong with the polish 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.970
 for this video there will be special 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.070
 how to make vinyl glue that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.630
 soon we will go to use 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.960
 you will simply see how it has it 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 used without obviously seeing how 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.200
 I created it in quotation marks 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.060
 for that there will be another video where 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.060
 precisely shows every single step 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.480
 now we take stripping i in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.580
 detail taken this rainbow where it is 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.830
 previously placed in one 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.410
 sport to bother for what I leave 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.220
 all the details at the exit itself 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.050
 in the file 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.510
 what you have to do we have to cut 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550
 small strips put one of them 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.010
 next to each other and as you can see s3 name 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.380
 then put 3 more on the other 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.910
 side at least there will be say points 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 of union because precisely then 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.590
 we will use these union points for 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 attach the micro beads to my tips 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.630
 to help you with tweezers like I am 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.260
 making me to position them 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.260
 at best 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.780
 once you place them all 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.950
 we can still proceed with the rest 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.950
 of our art 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.319
 first we take the glue 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.000
 created earlier and the position I love 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.280
 all around the cuticle round this 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.080
 will help to make the glaze if for 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.680
 case it should touch the skin not 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.770
 penetrates into the skin then creating a 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.170
 let's say more time in the removal 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.540
 instead with this glue when the glaze 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.860
 will touch the glue will be removed 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.530
 very very fast 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.540
 now let's move on to the action you have 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.090
 already seen a piece I took it anyway 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 my sponge or the dda's uniform between 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.840
 quotation marks in two colors in white green 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.340
 and then did the sponge effect 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.360
 on the nail as it was just seeing 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 from this picture you choose if you will give 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 a single pass or give two passes 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.390
 depending on how much you want to intensify 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.340
 the color once everything is perfect 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.170
 do not wait for the polish to dry e 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.000
 we send immediately with the help of a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.100
 tweezers to remove all 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.290
 strips that put you between a 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.420
 phase iii on the other this title as 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.739
 said earlier must be done on all 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 nails and therefore are steps that 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.150
 we're going to do one nail all over 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.790
 once we have all removed 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.049
 all the stripping from the nail we can 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.660
 always help us with tweezers 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.180
 also remove the glue we have in the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.829
 cuticle ride where practically the glue 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.570
 made in barrier quotes la 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.730
 our earth and the skin will not be 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.470
 stained just like you are about to see 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.470
 from the image itself 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.759
 now we take our foil e 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.930
 i top coat is a spot on daughter not 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.180
 pins in short what you want 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.900
 we put a little top coat in the points of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.759
 junction between let's say righetti or that 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.949
 we did before we take the micro 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.539
 pearls and we put one by one precisely 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.500
 at junction points like state 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.240
 seeing from the image that will give this 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.680
 quilted effect 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.930
 once applied on all nails and 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.940
 has meant that everything is literally 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.710
 completely dry we now pass the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.240
 our top coat to seal a 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.610
 protect it in the high we have made 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.420
 to ensure that in any case the two enamel 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.310
 last longer 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.040
 I recommend you always remember to 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.110
 cover the tip well and this side 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.700
 final result of my longing I hope 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.040
 so much that you like this idea at 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.040
 next video again on all but hello
