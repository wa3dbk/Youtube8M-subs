00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.490
 good anyway to a new video 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.609
 good a couple of important things about 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.140
 battlefield 4 good first of all the 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.910
 confirmed weapons seems to be that there is a 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.800
 fairly comprehensive list of weapons 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.140
 confirmed that they have been seen from the 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.840
 battlefield alpha 4 in modes 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.310
 story in different videos and such and 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.110
 well it seems that there is a list 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.730
 quite extensive and you have the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.490
 written description since if I put 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.660
 the daily link gamers as always 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.240
 we will fall we have a server 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 quite poor because then the way and 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.750
 surely the page will fall on 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.120
 good color you do not have written on the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.710
 basically copied and good description 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.630
 one of the things that I have not talked about 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.730
 still good that he has come and an 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.780
 a long time ago and good has not 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.520
 talked still and good I think 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.380
 quite interesting that it seems that 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.530
 is commenting on us in the forums 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.090
 debates enough about the battle pick 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.129
 up it seems that good looks 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.440
 be that they are weapons that are located by 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.629
 the maps and such and how good it seems to be 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.539
 that you can not answer with them and 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.219
 these weapons because they would not be in 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.350
 different boxes spread over the map 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.780
 they would not be special weapons that would be 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.730
 powerful not more powerful than those that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.640
 we can equip ourselves and such 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.710
 they have a pretty pretty advantage 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 wide I think this is going to give 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.460
 quite more vidilla to the multiplayer of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.830
 battlefield 4 is going to be an incentive 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.050
 quite pretty good and I think it's going 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.180
 to be a very broad strategy apart 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.130
 of the objective you have to fulfill in the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.690
 mission well I think that pick up 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.760
 these boxes is going to be so in paramount 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.810
 to be able to win good as I say good to 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.010
 you have the weapon list in the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.420
 description as I say you only have to 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.390
 take off one I'm not going to do the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.520
 ridiculous naming weapons and naming the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.930
 bad so good because nothing you have it in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.370
 the description as I say good nothing else 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.570
 kids, I hope you liked it in 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.070
 nothing for the truth waiting with 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.510
 enough desire and battlefield 4 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.310
 remember how good it seems to be that in 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.250
 next generation consoles we're going to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.230
 have 64 players and 60 frames per 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.960
 second constants so we 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.360
 promises to be pretty pretty good I think 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
 that is even more reserved 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 of the call of duty cost I 'm not very 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.670
 sure of what he is saying 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.980
 but I think next generation is 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.480
 being somewhat more reserved than call of 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.380
 duty but good for now it seems 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.060
 be that in this generation 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.289
 earning in reserves that the useful car 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 but good in next generation it seems 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.920
 to be winning butterfield 4 but 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.349
 let's see what happens because 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.959
 really want to continue the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.849
 reservations really well in the long term to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.550
 short term reality because they do not say anything 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.069
 in the long term, less than what matters 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.650
 really are the sales and we'll see to see 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.440
 What is really happening this year? 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 I see battlefield 4 very very strong and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 I think that people are taking 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.080
 more interest in this game than by call 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.910
 We will see to see what it is that 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.380
 it happens in the end good as always 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.060
 I 'm not going to buy the two 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.150
 surely it is much more game because no 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 only from shooters we live the gamers 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.910
 nothing more kids this has been all in 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.390
 nothing we do not see in the next video until 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.390
 the next show
