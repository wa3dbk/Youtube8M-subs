00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.370
 I would like 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:28.700
 It is the content side, but in the situation that does not come with feeling that so much carbonic acid is defensive 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.770
 When it opens, it seems that some days carbonation works well 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.210
 Though it was not feeling 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.210
