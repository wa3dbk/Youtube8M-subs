the episode the color and it's laughs
longer<00:05:10.320> but<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.410> chemicals<00:05:11.830> stay<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
longer but the chemicals stay on the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.710 
longer but the chemicals stay on the
dope<00:05:12.370> on<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.610> surface<00:05:12.970> like<00:05:13.180> if<00:05:13.240> damaged<00:05:13.540> have

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
dope on the surface like if damaged have

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.820 
dope on the surface like if damaged have
come<00:05:13.900> up<00:05:14.080> gives<00:05:14.320> off

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830
