preseason<00:00:33.090> game<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.230> makes<00:00:34.469> sense

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
preseason game to me that makes sense

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.910 
preseason game to me that makes sense
see<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.520> he's<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:36.140> against<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
see what he's got against you know the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
see what he's got against you know the
Browns<00:00:38.190> number<00:00:38.610> two's<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.840> least<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Browns number two's in for at least a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
Browns number two's in for at least a
half<00:00:40.379> rather<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.980> quarter<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
half rather than a quarter I think that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.850 
half rather than a quarter I think that
the<00:00:42.629> goal<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> bears<00:00:43.170> coach<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the goal of the bears coach is here is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
the goal of the bears coach is here is
give<00:00:44.129> everyone<00:00:44.399> an<00:00:44.820> equal<00:00:45.090> amount<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> playing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
give everyone an equal amount of playing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
give everyone an equal amount of playing
time<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> winner<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
time and see you the winner is and I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
time and see you the winner is and I
think<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.750> Jordan<00:00:49.410> Palmer's<00:00:49.739> turn<00:00:50.010> right

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
think it's a Jordan Palmer's turn right

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
think it's a Jordan Palmer's turn right
and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:51.000> our<00:00:51.180> trash<00:00:51.390> Thunder<00:00:51.690> continues

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and I think our trash Thunder continues

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.619 
and I think our trash Thunder continues
to<00:00:52.170> stress<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:53.010> competition<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.850> far

get to prepare for this game like it was
a<00:01:24.119> normal<00:01:24.299> game<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> short<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
a normal game kind of short of the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
a normal game kind of short of the
specific<00:01:26.430> game<00:01:26.610> planning<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.630> would

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
specific game planning that they would

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899 
specific game planning that they would
do<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> regular<00:01:28.439> season<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.549> think

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
do in the regular season and I think

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
do in the regular season and I think
this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.329> true<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.900> test<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.439> are

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
this is as true of a test is that are

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
this is as true of a test is that are
