00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
every time you use the command block I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.779 
every time you use the command block I
will<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.730> putting<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:51.239> command<00:00:51.809> block<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
will be putting my command block on this

you have to do is pay attention to them
to<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> row<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> rose<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.780> X<00:01:19.110> Y<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to the row so it rose with the X Y and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.850 
to the row so it rose with the X Y and
the<00:01:20.159> Z<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.479> extra<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> numbers

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the Z on the extra look at the numbers

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.510 
the Z on the extra look at the numbers
in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> parenthesis<00:01:23.790> -<00:01:24.420> 5<00:01:24.630> 6<00:01:24.840> 1<00:01:25.369> you're<00:01:26.369> surely

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
in the parenthesis - 5 6 1 you're surely

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
in the parenthesis - 5 6 1 you're surely
gonna<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.820> different<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> recommend<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
gonna be different so I recommend you to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
gonna be different so I recommend you to
write<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:29.780> okay<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> white<00:01:31.500> row

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
write them down okay on the white row

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340 
write them down okay on the white row
below<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.159> ax<00:01:32.630> pay<00:01:33.630> attention<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> first

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
below the ax pay attention to the first

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
below the ax pay attention to the first
number<00:01:34.770> -<00:01:35.159> five<00:01:35.430> point<00:01:35.909> zero<00:01:36.060> zero<00:01:36.299> zero<00:01:36.570> all

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
number - five point zero zero zero all

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069 
number - five point zero zero zero all
you<00:01:37.290> need<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.619> numbers<00:01:37.979> before<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.210> decimal

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you need it's numbers before the decimal

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.639 
you need it's numbers before the decimal
so<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.220> worry<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> point<00:01:41.909> zero<00:01:42.150> zero

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
so don't worry about the point zero zero

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.770 
so don't worry about the point zero zero
okay<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.680> now<00:01:43.979> finally<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> last<00:01:44.880> row<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
okay so now finally on the last row and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.219 
okay so now finally on the last row and
see<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.680> numbers<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.360> 1279<00:01:48.360> yours<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.140> gonna

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
see my numbers are 1279 yours are gonna

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.940 
see my numbers are 1279 yours are gonna
be<00:01:49.409> different

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
be different

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.359 
be different
so<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:51.030> write<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.799> okay<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so again write them down okay so now I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
so again write them down okay so now I
know<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.729> coordinates<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.990> five

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
know my coordinates and they are five

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
know my coordinates and they are five
six<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.219> space<00:01:56.909> five<00:01:57.299> space<00:01:58.490> 1279<00:01:59.540> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
six one space five space 1279 and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
six one space five space 1279 and
obviously<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.140> area<00:02:01.500> dices<00:02:01.740> are<00:02:01.829> gonna<00:02:02.009> be

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
obviously your area dices are gonna be

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.649 
obviously your area dices are gonna be
different<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.729> hold<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.479> because

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
different so hold on to them because

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.499 
different so hold on to them because
we're<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> use<00:02:04.259> them<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:06.299> we're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
we're about to use them so now we're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
we're about to use them so now we're
going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> enter<00:02:06.869> our<00:02:07.049> coordinates<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
going to enter our coordinates in the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
going to enter our coordinates in the
command<00:02:08.520> block<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
command block and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
command block and
when<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.500> click<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.849> man<00:02:12.420> he's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
type in backslash T P ah P and then you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:30.920 
type in backslash T P ah P and then you
answer<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.560> command<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.190> coordinates<00:02:29.930> okay
