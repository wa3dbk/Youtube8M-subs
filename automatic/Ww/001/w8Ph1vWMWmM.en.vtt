00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.080
 good in 2002 has not yet experienced news 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:08.379
 quite interesting that comes from part 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.700
 Colima you know she likes a lot 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.769
 fantasize with your next games 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.539
 and other titles sometimes becomes 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.330
 reality other times not and good 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.670
 basically good in the taipei game show 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.529
 talking to famitsu well he is 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.060
 saying that he would like very much 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.580
 in doing as of like a a remake of 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.830
 first bond of the metal already on not of 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.190
 prenatal already on metal gear solid 'that 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.020
 will be originally for playstation one 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.570
 and good as I say it would like to do 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.719
 a remake and also open world but 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.109
 who is currently very busy with 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:47.750
 metal gear thing without metal and only five 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.239
 states with metal gear solid 5 yo la 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.649
 true not the truth is that I did this with 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.879
 and bad of the open world of these 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.859
 first that I did but has always 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.840
 talked about what I tell them quite 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.300
 In addition, the man of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.280
 make a remake of metal gear solid 'no 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.170
 you would like and you would like it came 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.750
 another developer because it 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.710
 propose to do it under his supervision and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.810
 I'm the truth 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 it's different novice developers and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 others to try at least or 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.340
 to do something like that and that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.280
 I know I do not know 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 and try it really I do not think that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.759
 you can get pretty pretty good 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.770
 in saying that I hope this is real I think 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.319
 that I really think that I would turn 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.390
 uncomfortable having a dlc with the map or going to 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.030
 be a this one left something like that with 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.310
 shadows is surely a dlc finishes 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.600
 you end up leaving and others and I think that 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.640
 is going to make that world real 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.640
 open and see there for being different 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.109
 mapped metal gear solid 'solid the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.030
 play 1 in put me selection as 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.470
 probably also kojima and game 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.149
 quite interesting and a while ago 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.550
 that you would like a starring game 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 starring voice 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.920
 something that would be pretty good a style 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.110
 of spin-off like metal gear has been 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 solid rising with raid where it would be 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.370
 pretty good a game with voices 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.590
 would it be the dick I hope that the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.690
 next game of kojima seriously 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.520
 after putting only five already that 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.340
 metal day a game with the boss as 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.470
 protagonist that would be the though it's that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.660
 you can do both metal games 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.270
 gear in truth from the first ones that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.950
 they came out and other good things can be done 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.610
 many Egyptians can do so many 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.320
 still adapt them to this generation and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 others even invent new stories 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.790
 Let's go we can die all that 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.470
 we have mental was already for a while the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.870
 game fans was mega 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.160
 very clear not only masters see me like that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.720
 that good nothing else we will see according to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 let's say this remake of metal gear solid 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.040
 I really do not think so I think what 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.770
 We will see quite a distance or we will see 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.630
 of a dlc to calm down stays 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.940
 there are many ideas out there to do 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.840
 new things and so on and probably 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.640
 take us this sheet and another one 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.600
 kojima if you like to improve yourself with each 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.030
 game 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.410
 that's the mall I 've always really 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 said that he likes to be very 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.820
 perfectionist and always try to take 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.230
 the perfect game and how technology 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.420
 they are advancing because we do not have 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.000
 opportunity to do different things 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.530
 We'll see what happens nothing 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.130
 more guys see you in the next video 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.130
 until next time
