we're<00:00:09.660> planning<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.380> planting<00:00:11.100> a<00:00:11.220> row<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
we're planning on planting a row of

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.790 
we're planning on planting a row of
blackberries<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.780> row<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.020> raspberries

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
blackberries and a row of raspberries

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.100 
blackberries and a row of raspberries
here<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.160> our<00:00:14.280> small<00:00:14.610> fruit<00:00:14.910> garden<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.480> so

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
here in our small fruit garden and so

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.750 
here in our small fruit garden and so
this<00:00:16.410> year<00:00:16.680> we're<00:00:16.920> getting<00:00:17.070> our<00:00:17.279> planting

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
this year we're getting our planting

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
this year we're getting our planting
site<00:00:18.029> prepared<00:00:18.510> there's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.200> few<00:00:19.470> things<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
site prepared there's a few things that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
site prepared there's a few things that
we<00:00:20.010> need<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> consider<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.029> select<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we need to consider when we select a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.929 
we need to consider when we select a
planting<00:00:22.020> site<00:00:22.290> for<00:00:22.590> brambles<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.700> first

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
planting site for brambles the first

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
planting site for brambles the first
thing<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.270> sun<00:00:24.720> exposure<00:00:25.220> blackberries<00:00:26.220> are

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
thing is sun exposure blackberries are

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.040 
thing is sun exposure blackberries are
going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.520> perform<00:00:26.700> best<00:00:27.270> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.779> site<00:00:28.020> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
going to perform best in a site that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.280 
going to perform best in a site that
receives<00:00:28.619> full<00:00:29.040> Sun<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.239> raspberries<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
receives full Sun but raspberries are a

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.260 
receives full Sun but raspberries are a
little<00:00:31.680> less<00:00:31.919> heat<00:00:32.250> tolerant<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
little less heat tolerant and so in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
little less heat tolerant and so in
Oklahoma<00:00:33.720> we<00:00:33.930> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> look<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.470> site<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Oklahoma we want to look for a site that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
Oklahoma we want to look for a site that
receives<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.520> 50%<00:00:36.420> shade<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.110> those

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
receives about 50% shade for those

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.010 
receives about 50% shade for those
plants<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.610> also<00:00:38.760> need<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> consider<00:00:39.450> air

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
plants we also need to consider air

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.890 
plants we also need to consider air
movement<00:00:41.030> whenever<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.210> planting<00:00:42.600> fruits

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
movement whenever we're planting fruits

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.080 
movement whenever we're planting fruits
we<00:00:43.260> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> avoid<00:00:43.800> areas<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.550> very<00:00:44.580> low

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we want to avoid areas that are very low

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.300 
we want to avoid areas that are very low
because<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> cold<00:00:46.200> air<00:00:46.440> tends<00:00:46.740> to<00:00:47.040> settle

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
because the cold air tends to settle

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.980 
because the cold air tends to settle
there<00:00:47.580> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> spring<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.810> cause

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
there in the spring and that can cause

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.190 
there in the spring and that can cause
some<00:00:49.020> frost<00:00:49.620> damage<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.280> our<00:00:50.310> plants<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.200> the

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
some frost damage on our plants and the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200 
some frost damage on our plants and the
summer<00:00:52.500> winds<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.490> brutal<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.090> we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
summer winds can also be brutal so we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.940 
summer winds can also be brutal so we
want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> look<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.810> site<00:00:55.080> that's<00:00:55.260> protected

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
want to look for a site that's protected

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.550 
want to look for a site that's protected
from<00:00:56.130> those<00:00:56.310> dry<00:00:56.670> summer<00:00:57.120> winds<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.380> there's

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
from those dry summer winds now there's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.440 
from those dry summer winds now there's
a<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:58.829> special<00:00:59.190> consideration<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.329> we're

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
a very special consideration when we're

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.900 
a very special consideration when we're
planting<00:01:00.690> brambles<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.550> avoid<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
planting brambles and that's to avoid a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299 
planting brambles and that's to avoid a
disease<00:01:03.600> problem<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> look<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
disease problem we want to look for a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.899 
disease problem we want to look for a
site<00:01:05.670> where<00:01:06.299> other<00:01:06.750> brambles<00:01:07.909> strawberries

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
site where other brambles strawberries

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
site where other brambles strawberries
and<00:01:09.180> solanaceous<00:01:09.630> crops<00:01:10.229> such<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.770> potatoes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and solanaceous crops such as potatoes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.999 
and solanaceous crops such as potatoes
tomatoes<00:01:12.149> peppers<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> eggplants<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.679> not

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
tomatoes peppers and eggplants have not

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.059 
tomatoes peppers and eggplants have not
been<00:01:14.310> grown<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.969> many<00:01:15.390> years<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.920> these

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
been grown for many years all of these

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.819 
been grown for many years all of these
plants<00:01:17.609> Harbor<00:01:18.060> verticillium<00:01:18.719> wilt<00:01:18.829> which

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
plants Harbor verticillium wilt which

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.910 
plants Harbor verticillium wilt which
can<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.280> devastating<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.119> brambles<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
can be devastating to our brambles and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
can be devastating to our brambles and
the<00:01:22.920> pathogen<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.579> causes<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.210> disease

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the pathogen that causes this disease

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
the pathogen that causes this disease
can<00:01:24.929> remain<00:01:25.139> active<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.859> soil<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.520> many

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
can remain active in the soil for many

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.489 
can remain active in the soil for many
years<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:27.359> even<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> haven't<00:01:28.109> planted

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
years so even if you haven't planted

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.499 
years so even if you haven't planted
tomatoes<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:29.549> years<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.329> not

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tomatoes for two years it's just not

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
tomatoes for two years it's just not
quite<00:01:30.689> long<00:01:30.960> enough<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.460> best<00:01:32.639> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
quite long enough it's really best to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.529 
quite long enough it's really best to
find<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.630> completely<00:01:34.289> clean<00:01:34.649> site<00:01:35.450> well<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
find a completely clean site well the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.879 
find a completely clean site well the
next<00:01:36.719> thing<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> consider<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.649> our

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
next thing we want to consider is our

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.099 
next thing we want to consider is our
soil<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.179> can<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.539> here<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.929> we've

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
soil and you can see here that we've

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.080 
soil and you can see here that we've
raised<00:01:40.469> our<00:01:40.709> bed<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.039> what<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.639> is<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
raised our bed and what this is going to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
raised our bed and what this is going to
do<00:01:42.359> is<00:01:42.569> help<00:01:42.810> improve<00:01:43.350> drainage<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.579> also

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
do is help improve drainage we also

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.599 
do is help improve drainage we also
cultivated<00:01:45.899> deeply<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.560> loosen<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> soil<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
cultivated deeply to loosen the soil and

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.469 
cultivated deeply to loosen the soil and
we<00:01:48.030> incorporated<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.929> large<00:01:49.530> amount<00:01:50.069> of

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
we incorporated a large amount of

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
we incorporated a large amount of
organic<00:01:51.479> matter<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.079> used<00:01:52.289> manure<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.100> that's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
organic matter we used manure and that's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.969 
organic matter we used manure and that's
going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.179> add<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.929> of<00:01:54.959> nitrogen<00:01:55.529> to<00:01:55.679> our

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
going to add a lot of nitrogen to our

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
going to add a lot of nitrogen to our
soil<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.389> plants<00:01:57.779> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.020> start

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
soil really give our plants a good start

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.739 
soil really give our plants a good start
so<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.740> nice<00:01:58.889> loose<00:01:59.279> base<00:01:59.609> to<00:02:00.420> begin

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
so we have a nice loose base to begin

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.429 
so we have a nice loose base to begin
with<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.170> our<00:02:02.159> raised<00:02:02.490> bed<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.209> a<00:02:03.899> little<00:02:04.170> over

with and our raised bed is a little over
three<00:02:04.709> feet<00:02:04.950> wide<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.179> beds<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:07.079> be

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
three feet wide you want your beds to be

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
three feet wide you want your beds to be
at<00:02:07.409> least<00:02:07.560> three<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> half<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> three

at least three two and a half to three
feet<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> give<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.229> plants

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
feet and that's going to give the plants

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
feet and that's going to give the plants
a<00:02:10.800> large<00:02:11.550> rooting<00:02:12.270> area<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.900> need<00:02:13.080> at<00:02:13.260> least

a three-foot rooting area to perform

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.550 
a three-foot rooting area to perform
well<00:02:17.060> another<00:02:18.060> advantage<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.810> preparing<00:02:19.440> our

planting site ahead of time

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.350 
planting site ahead of time
is<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.500> manage<00:02:21.830> weeds<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.460> much<00:02:22.730> easier<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
is to manage weeds it's much easier to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.240 
is to manage weeds it's much easier to
remove<00:02:23.780> especially<00:02:24.380> those<00:02:24.530> perennial<00:02:25.069> weeds

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
remove especially those perennial weeds

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.040 
remove especially those perennial weeds
when<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:25.940> don't<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.209> our<00:02:26.330> plants<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.900> place

when we don't have our plants in place
it<00:02:27.500> also<00:02:27.890> gives<00:02:28.250> us<00:02:28.400> time<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.730> conduct<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.390> soil

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it also gives us time to conduct a soil

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.590 
it also gives us time to conduct a soil
test<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.350> adjust<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.980> pH<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:31.610> needed<00:02:32.150> the

thing we do when we prepare a site is to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.530 
thing we do when we prepare a site is to
build<00:02:38.450> trellises<00:02:39.850> trailing<00:02:40.850> blackberries

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
build trellises trailing blackberries

grow and most raspberries also require

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.490 
grow and most raspberries also require
trellises<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.820> erect<00:02:50.290> blackberries<00:02:51.290> don't

trellises the erect blackberries don't
necessarily<00:02:52.160> require<00:02:52.310> trellises<00:02:53.239> but<00:02:53.840> with

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
necessarily require trellises but with

the<00:02:54.170> strong<00:02:54.500> oklahoma<00:02:55.220> winds<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.850> certainly

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
the strong oklahoma winds it's certainly

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.729 
the strong oklahoma winds it's certainly
a<00:02:56.239> good<00:02:56.450> idea<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.260> will<00:02:57.620> help

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
a good idea because that will help

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.380 
a good idea because that will help
prevent<00:02:58.310> them<00:02:58.459> from<00:02:58.520> tipping<00:02:59.090> over<00:02:59.209> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
prevent them from tipping over and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.240 
prevent them from tipping over and
breaking<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.650> we're<00:03:00.769> going<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.950> be<00:03:01.070> growing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
breaking so we're going to be growing

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.759 
breaking so we're going to be growing
both<00:03:01.610> erect<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.360> semi<00:03:02.780> erect<00:03:02.930> blackberries

we're going to use a t-bar style trellis
to<00:03:06.769> support<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.030> posts<00:03:08.480> are

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
to support them the posts are

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.770 
to support them the posts are
constructed<00:03:09.350> from<00:03:09.560> an<00:03:09.860> 8<00:03:10.040> foot<00:03:10.250> length<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.790> 4x4

constructed from an 8 foot length of 4x4

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.840 
constructed from an 8 foot length of 4x4
and<00:03:11.959> we<00:03:12.080> use<00:03:12.230> cedar<00:03:12.709> because<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.370> very

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
and we use cedar because it's very

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.470 
and we use cedar because it's very
durable

we<00:03:15.290> started<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:15.800> cutting<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.220> 2<00:03:16.430> foot<00:03:16.640> section

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
we started by cutting a 2 foot section

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.800 
we started by cutting a 2 foot section
off<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.870> wood<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.610> set<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:20.000> remaining<00:03:20.300> 6

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
off of the wood and set the remaining 6

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.720 
off of the wood and set the remaining 6
foot<00:03:21.110> section<00:03:21.590> into<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.980> ground<00:03:22.250> about<00:03:22.430> two

using a carriage bolt the two foot

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.930 
using a carriage bolt the two foot
section<00:03:35.900> should<00:03:36.110> be<00:03:36.170> between<00:03:37.100> 3<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.489> 4<00:03:37.670> feet

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
section should be between 3 and 4 feet

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.300 
section should be between 3 and 4 feet
off<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.480> ground<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:39.160> we're<00:03:40.160> going<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
off of the ground and we're going to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.819 
off of the ground and we're going to
attach<00:03:40.820> our<00:03:41.060> wires<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.440> want<00:03:42.650> to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
attach our wires to that you want to

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.190 
attach our wires to that you want to
adjust<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.400> number<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.880> posts<00:03:44.390> according<00:03:44.840> to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
adjust the number of posts according to

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.560 
adjust the number of posts according to
the<00:03:45.320> length<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.829> your<00:03:46.010> planting<00:03:46.549> bed<00:03:46.760> our<00:03:47.030> bed

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
the length of your planting bed our bed

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.259 
the length of your planting bed our bed
is<00:03:47.750> 24<00:03:48.260> feet<00:03:48.470> long<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.310> we've<00:03:49.549> used<00:03:49.820> three

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
is 24 feet long and so we've used three

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.319 
is 24 feet long and so we've used three
posts<00:03:50.810> set<00:03:51.170> 12<00:03:51.470> feet<00:03:51.769> apart<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.760> don't<00:03:52.790> want

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
wire needs to be attached securely but

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.910 
wire needs to be attached securely but
allow<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.329> little<00:04:14.630> bit<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.930> give<00:04:15.170> it's<00:04:15.739> also

a<00:04:19.280> little<00:04:19.430> bit<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:20.419> can<00:04:20.600> attach<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.410> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
a little bit you can attach it to the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.190 
a little bit you can attach it to the
posts<00:04:22.010> using<00:04:22.370> staples<00:04:22.669> or<00:04:23.180> what<00:04:23.780> we're<00:04:23.960> using

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
posts using staples or what we're using

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.010 
posts using staples or what we're using
is<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> device<00:04:24.919> called<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.340> wire<00:04:25.580> vise<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.270> what

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
is a device called a wire vise and what

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.440 
is a device called a wire vise and what
this<00:04:27.200> does<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.919> allows<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.550> wire<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.240> pass

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
this does is it allows the wire to pass

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.510 
this does is it allows the wire to pass
through<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.990> one<00:04:30.229> direction<00:04:30.440> only<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.310> once

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
through in one direction only so once

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520 
through in one direction only so once
you<00:04:31.669> put<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.970> wire<00:04:32.150> through<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:33.020> can't<00:04:33.289> pull

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
you put the wire through you can't pull

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.830 
you put the wire through you can't pull
it<00:04:33.590> back<00:04:33.770> out<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.280> holds

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
it back out and that holds

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.000 
it back out and that holds
attention<00:04:36.060> now<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.240> easiest<00:04:37.780> if<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.380> pass

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
attention now it's easiest if you pass

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.860 
attention now it's easiest if you pass
the<00:04:39.310> wire<00:04:39.490> through<00:04:39.940> what<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.419> did<00:04:40.449> is<00:04:40.690> we<00:04:40.840> put

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
the wire through what we did is we put

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.350 
the wire through what we did is we put
holes<00:04:41.410> through<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.889> post<00:04:42.160> if<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:43.000> put<00:04:43.270> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
holes through the post if you put the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.510 
holes through the post if you put the
wire<00:04:43.540> through<00:04:43.570> first<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.590> then<00:04:45.070> go<00:04:45.220> ahead<00:04:45.340> and

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
wire through first and then go ahead and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.360 
wire through first and then go ahead and
slide<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.900> Vice<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.410> it's<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:47.800> easier<00:04:48.280> to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
slide the Vice on it's just easier to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.820 
slide the Vice on it's just easier to
feed<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.910> through<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.510> as<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.380> see<00:04:50.530> we<00:04:50.680> could

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
feed it through and as you see we could

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.129 
feed it through and as you see we could
pull<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.220> through<00:04:51.699> but<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.600> can't<00:04:52.900> pull<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
pull this through but I can't pull it

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.290 
pull this through but I can't pull it
back<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.710> other<00:04:53.830> direction<00:04:54.120> we're<00:04:55.120> just

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
back in the other direction we're just

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.530 
back in the other direction we're just
going<00:04:55.449> to<00:04:55.479> secure<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.020> on<00:04:56.229> with<00:04:56.410> screws<00:04:57.540> this

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
going to secure this on with screws this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.050 
going to secure this on with screws this
wire<00:04:58.870> vise<00:04:59.169> will<00:04:59.410> make<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.710> very<00:04:59.740> easy<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.460> pull

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
wire vise will make it very easy to pull

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.930 
wire vise will make it very easy to pull
