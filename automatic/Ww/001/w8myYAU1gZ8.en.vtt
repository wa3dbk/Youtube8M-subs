it<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.850> lethal<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.350> last<00:01:37.619> year

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it was as lethal as he was last year

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
it was as lethal as he was last year
when<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.130> played<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.640> him<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:38.880> alongside<00:01:39.270> with

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
when I played with him an alongside with

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
when I played with him an alongside with
our<00:01:39.900> crespo<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.250> extremely<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:42.299> he

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
our crespo which was extremely good he

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
our crespo which was extremely good he
finished<00:01:42.840> everything<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> five<00:01:44.070> style

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
finished everything with that five style

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
finished everything with that five style
weak<00:01:44.700> foot<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.570> had<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.079> good<00:01:46.170> shot<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.829> him

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
weak foot he had a very good shot on him

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.700 
weak foot he had a very good shot on him
but<00:01:47.430> let's<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.720> gameplay<00:01:48.960> I'd<00:01:49.500> say

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
but let's get into the gameplay I'd say

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.520 
but let's get into the gameplay I'd say
crespo<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.509> first<00:01:51.840> guy<00:01:51.990> who<00:01:52.170> score

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
crespo he was the first guy who score

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
crespo he was the first guy who score
most<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.100> goals<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.850> his<00:01:54.450> finishing

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
most of my goals because his finishing

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
most of my goals because his finishing
was<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.829> good<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.250> my<00:01:56.369> opinion<00:01:56.399> he

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
was a very very good in my opinion he

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
was a very very good in my opinion he
was<00:01:57.149> able<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.899> past<00:01:58.140> players<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.890> score

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
was able to go past players and score

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
was able to go past players and score
some<00:01:59.759> pretty<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.270> goals<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.869> wish<00:02:01.229> he<00:02:01.380> had

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
some pretty good goals I wish he had

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
some pretty good goals I wish he had
five<00:02:01.770> star<00:02:02.070> skills<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:03.000> him<00:02:03.119> an

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
five star skills it would make him an

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
five star skills it would make him an
even<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.780> fun<00:02:04.049> player<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> play<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:05.009> but

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
even more fun player to play with but

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
even more fun player to play with but
still<00:02:05.340> he<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.299> very<00:02:06.659> very<00:02:06.869> good<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.770> game

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
still he is a very very good on the game

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.449 
still he is a very very good on the game
now<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:09.209> course<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> despite<00:02:11.009> being<00:02:11.280> on

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
now of course all it despite being on

the<00:02:11.580> sand<00:02:11.790> I'm<00:02:11.940> submit<00:02:12.270> he<00:02:12.450> was

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the sand I'm submit he was

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.480 
the sand I'm submit he was
able<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.080> create<00:02:13.440> stuff<00:02:13.770> because<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> cannot

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
able to create stuff because you cannot

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.490 
able to create stuff because you cannot
really<00:02:14.820> stop<00:02:15.240> him<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.170> did<00:02:16.320> have

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
really stop him and then you did have

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.470 
really stop him and then you did have
Rinaldo<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.400> his<00:02:17.550> free<00:02:17.880> kicks<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.330> are

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
quite a bit of distance I guess was I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.980 
quite a bit of distance I guess was I'm
not<00:02:33.540> too<00:02:33.690> sure<00:02:33.750> how<00:02:33.930> far<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.800> maybe<00:02:35.040> 30

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
not too sure how far out it was maybe 30

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.900 
not too sure how far out it was maybe 30
28<00:02:36.990> 30<00:02:37.350> yards<00:02:38.010> something<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> nice

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
28 30 yards something like that nice

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.610 
28 30 yards something like that nice
little<00:02:39.060> three<00:02:39.330> kick<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.660> at<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.320> near<00:02:40.530> post

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
little three kick in at the near post

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.220 
little three kick in at the near post
and<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.490> really<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.480> replays<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and I really do like the replays on the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
and I really do like the replays on the
freaking<00:02:43.650> can't<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.460> curve<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.330> shot

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
freaking can't see the curve in the shot

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.500 
freaking can't see the curve in the shot
and<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.380> believe<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:47.640> too<00:02:47.790> sure<00:02:47.940> i<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.330> not

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and I believe I'm not too sure i do not

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.910 
and I believe I'm not too sure i do not
think<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.870> was<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> power<00:02:49.410> speaking<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.890> think

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
think this was a power speaking I think

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.040 
think this was a power speaking I think
this<00:02:50.220> was<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.640> regular<00:02:50.880> free<00:02:51.300> cake<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:52.020> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
this was just a regular free cake but I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.870 
this was just a regular free cake but I
would<00:02:52.290> score<00:02:52.620> another<00:02:53.010> free<00:02:53.310> kick<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.700> wit

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
would score another free kick it wit

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.390 
would score another free kick it wit
brunelda<00:02:54.300> which<00:02:54.570> was<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.410> power<00:02:55.680> free-kick<00:02:56.220> now

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
brunelda which was a power free-kick now

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.810 
brunelda which was a power free-kick now
Pele<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> said<00:02:57.650> he<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.680> okay<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> play<00:02:59.520> with

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
Pele as I said he is okay to play with

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.610 
Pele as I said he is okay to play with
but<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.420> he's<00:03:00.570> gonna<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.110> same<00:03:01.320> price

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
but if he's gonna have the same price

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.470 
but if he's gonna have the same price
tag<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.040> last<00:03:02.310> year<00:03:02.550> he<00:03:02.730> will<00:03:02.850> definitely<00:03:03.360> not

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
tag as last year he will definitely not

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.870 
tag as last year he will definitely not
be<00:03:03.540> worth<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.170> because<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.740> didn't<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:05.760> feel

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
be worth it because I didn't really feel

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.699 
be worth it because I didn't really feel
like<00:03:06.090> last<00:03:06.510> year<00:03:06.690> felt<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.440> could<00:03:07.590> just

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
like last year felt like you could just

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.650 
like last year felt like you could just
shoot<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.370> would<00:03:08.520> school<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.150> didn't<00:03:09.570> have

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
shoot and he would school I didn't have

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.090 
shoot and he would school I didn't have
the<00:03:09.810> same<00:03:10.050> feeling<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.680> time<00:03:10.950> around

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
the same feeling this time around

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.370 
the same feeling this time around
because<00:03:11.550> well<00:03:12.300> I'm<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.600> not<00:03:12.720> too<00:03:12.959> used<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
because well I'm just not too used to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.220 
because well I'm just not too used to

the shooting yet on 15 and just taking a
shot<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.800> felt<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.430> didn't<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.850> that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.060 
shot it felt like I didn't have that
much<00:03:18.239> control<00:03:18.450> off<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.080> was<00:03:19.290> last<00:03:19.650> year<00:03:19.800> as<00:03:19.920> i

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.110 
and you would pretty much go and that's
just<00:03:25.170> not<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> same<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.920> year<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:27.000> not

it maybe once i played the game or he

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.190 
it maybe once i played the game or he
would<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.489> more<00:03:32.700> useful<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:33.840> nonetheless

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200

from him like a play like Ronaldo I felt

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.560

was way better and I do finger play like

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.570 
was way better and I do finger play like
Neymar<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.110> also<00:03:49.500> feel<00:03:49.709> better<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.400> play

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
Neymar will also feel better to play

with it then I caught you and I
mentioned<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.340> last<00:03:53.580> quarter

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
mentioned this in in the last quarter

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.670 
mentioned this in in the last quarter
play<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.390> coach<00:03:54.660> in<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.049> well<00:03:55.320> because

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
play with a coach in as well because

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.880 
play with a coach in as well because
he's<00:03:56.070> okay<00:03:56.459> but<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.350> kind<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.410> wanted<00:03:58.650> more

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
he's okay but I just kind of wanted more

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.160 
he's okay but I just kind of wanted more
from<00:03:59.160> I<00:03:59.220> think<00:03:59.400> place<00:04:00.120> like<00:04:00.360> Ronaldo<00:04:00.870> will<00:04:01.019> be

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
from I think place like Ronaldo will be

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.870 
from I think place like Ronaldo will be
better<00:04:01.380> than<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.769> Pele<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.250> name<00:04:02.489> i<00:04:02.519> will<00:04:02.640> be

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
better than like Pele and name i will be

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.520 
better than like Pele and name i will be
better<00:04:03.060> than<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.330> coach<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.019> better<00:04:04.320> off

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
better than a coach and you better off

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
better than a coach and you better off
going<00:04:04.739> with<00:04:04.980> those<00:04:05.100> players<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:06.660> my

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
going with those players and in my

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.930 
going with those players and in my
opinion<00:04:06.989> buddy<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.980> go<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.400> nice

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940
