that<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> setup<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> story<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that the setup for the story is kind of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.760 
that the setup for the story is kind of
told<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> order<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
told out of order and you do have to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
told out of order and you do have to
think<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> order<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> follow<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.869> kind

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
think in order to follow it so it's kind

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
think in order to follow it so it's kind
of<00:01:49.290> nice<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.979> entirely<00:01:50.220> spoon-fed<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of nice that's not entirely spoon-fed to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.609 
of nice that's not entirely spoon-fed to
you<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.600> since<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> computer<00:01:52.229> age<00:01:52.259> has

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
you but since the computer age has

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
you but since the computer age has
exploded<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.430> gotten<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> lot<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
exploded we gotten to know a lot of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.499 
exploded we gotten to know a lot of
these<00:01:54.689> terms<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.500> even<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.850> still<00:01:56.939> kind

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
these terms and even now it's still kind

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.420 
these terms and even now it's still kind
of<00:01:57.630> hard<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.960> follow<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> say

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
of hard to follow now that's not to say

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
of hard to follow now that's not to say
you<00:01:59.460> can't<00:01:59.610> entirely<00:02:00.390> follow<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.409> just

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you can't entirely follow it you just

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
you can't entirely follow it you just
really<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> pay<00:02:02.460> attention<00:02:02.600> maybe<00:02:03.600> that's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
really got to pay attention maybe that's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120 
really got to pay attention maybe that's
why<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> film<00:02:04.500> first<00:02:04.710> came<00:02:04.920> out<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
why when the film first came out it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.930 
why when the film first came out it
wasn't<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.000> big<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> hit

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
wasn't that big a hit

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.730 
wasn't that big a hit
but<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.120> can<00:02:07.510> also<00:02:07.690> see<00:02:07.960> why<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.260> would<00:02:08.530> also

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
but I can also see why that would also

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.680 
but I can also see why that would also
be<00:02:08.920> how<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.490> got<00:02:09.670> an<00:02:09.850> audience<00:02:10.030> over<00:02:10.479> time

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
be how it got an audience over time

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.120 
be how it got an audience over time
because<00:02:11.410> there<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> lot<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.890> clever

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
because there is a lot of clever

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.800 
because there is a lot of clever
commentary<00:02:12.730> particularly<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
commentary particularly with the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.810 
commentary particularly with the
religious<00:02:14.230> aspect<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.160> users<00:02:15.610> are

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
religious aspect the users are

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.610 
religious aspect the users are
apparently<00:02:16.300> controlling<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.870> programs<00:02:17.350> but

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
apparently controlling the programs but

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.290 
apparently controlling the programs but
the<00:02:17.770> programs<00:02:18.190> also<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.700> souls<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.150> their

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the programs also have souls of their

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.360 
the programs also have souls of their
own<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.780> who's<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.590> controlling<00:02:21.040> who

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
own so who's really controlling who

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.160 
own so who's really controlling who
there's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.300> fun<00:02:22.540> stuff<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.960> can<00:02:23.080> be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
there's a lot of fun stuff that can be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.080 
there's a lot of fun stuff that can be
had<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.560> they<00:02:24.100> do<00:02:24.160> tap<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> quite<00:02:25.060> a

had with that they do tap on it quite a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.820 
had with that they do tap on it quite a
bit<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:25.990> tell<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> majority<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
bit you can tell the majority of the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.590 
bit you can tell the majority of the
time<00:02:26.980> spent<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.580> movie<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.000> perfecting

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
time spent on this movie is perfecting

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.690 
time spent on this movie is perfecting
its<00:02:28.750> look<00:02:28.990> which<00:02:29.530> while<00:02:29.950> we're<00:02:30.130> at<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.280> let's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
its look which while we're at it let's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.640 
its look which while we're at it let's
talk<00:02:30.910> about<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.330> look<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.230> by<00:02:32.410> far

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
talk about the look because it is by far

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.550 
talk about the look because it is by far
the<00:02:32.710> best<00:02:33.190> part<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> movie<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.870> film<00:02:35.230> has

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the best part of the movie this film has

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.520 
the best part of the movie this film has
a<00:02:35.590> design<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.490> all<00:02:36.880> its<00:02:37.300> own<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.810> mean<00:02:38.260> yes

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
a design that is all its own I mean yes

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.160 
a design that is all its own I mean yes
it's<00:02:38.560> 80s<00:02:39.370> yes<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.940> bright<00:02:40.180> neon<00:02:40.630> against

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's 80s yes it's bright neon against

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.560 
it's 80s yes it's bright neon against
black<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.860> at<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.310> same<00:02:42.520> time<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.240> look<00:02:43.480> at

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
black but at the same time you look at

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.910 
black but at the same time you look at
this<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.080> first<00:02:44.290> thing<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.530> think<00:02:44.710> is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
this and the first thing you think is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.460 
this and the first thing you think is
trot<00:02:45.550> there's<00:02:46.240> not<00:02:46.480> really<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.990> lot<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.320> other

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
trot there's not really a lot of other

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.530 
trot there's not really a lot of other
movies<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.520> specific<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.180> design

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
movies that have this specific of design

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.080 
movies that have this specific of design
and<00:02:49.810> its<00:02:50.320> use<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.530> CG<00:02:51.070> animation<00:02:51.490> was<00:02:51.790> also

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and its use of CG animation was also

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.430 
and its use of CG animation was also
groundbreaking<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.870> never<00:02:52.990> really<00:02:53.290> been

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
groundbreaking and never really been

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.830 
groundbreaking and never really been
done<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:53.920> extent<00:02:54.280> before<00:02:54.540> nowadays<00:02:55.540> it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
done to this extent before nowadays it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.710 
done to this extent before nowadays it's
pretty<00:02:56.320> dated<00:02:56.710> but<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.460> still<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.000> stylized

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
pretty dated but it's still so stylized

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.660 
pretty dated but it's still so stylized
and<00:02:59.050> looks<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.410> good<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.190> kind<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.550> don't

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
and looks so good that you kind of don't

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.210 
and looks so good that you kind of don't
care<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.960> know<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.200> was<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.590> 80s<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.070> you

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
care you know it was the 80s and you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.650 
care you know it was the 80s and you
know<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.520> just<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.760> product<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.390> times

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
know it's just a product of the times

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.080 
know it's just a product of the times
but<00:03:05.050> man<00:03:05.770> is<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.040> such<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> good<00:03:06.730> looking

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
but man is it such a good looking

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.300 
but man is it such a good looking
product<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.720> times<00:03:07.960> some<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.920> looks<00:03:09.130> a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
product of the times some of it looks a

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190 
product of the times some of it looks a
little<00:03:09.820> cheap<00:03:10.300> like<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> costumes

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
little cheap like the costumes

more like cardboard but again you kind

sora blending the realities and that's

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.840 
sora blending the realities and that's
really<00:03:37.989> smart<00:03:38.380> against<00:03:39.190> or<00:03:39.370> playing<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:39.670> the

really smart against or playing with the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.350 
idea of who's controlling who Tron is
one<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.250> those<00:03:42.370> movies<00:03:42.670> were<00:03:42.790> when<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.030> really

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
one of those movies were when you really

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.690 
one of those movies were when you really
think<00:03:43.390> about<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.500> really<00:03:44.980> smart<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.550> is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
think about it is really smart and it is

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.090 
think about it is really smart and it is
really<00:03:46.030> clever<00:03:46.300> but<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.290> really<00:03:47.590> got<00:03:47.860> take

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
really clever but you really got take

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.040 
really clever but you really got take
that<00:03:48.250> time<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.489> think<00:03:48.760> about<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.660> terms<00:03:49.720> of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
that time to think about it in terms of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.810 
that time to think about it in terms of
just<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.350> straightforward<00:03:50.680> action<00:03:51.250> adventure

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
just a straightforward action adventure

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.259 
just a straightforward action adventure
it<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.780> please<00:03:53.350> people<00:03:54.100> but<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.820> said<00:03:55.000> you

it can please people but like I said you
got<00:03:55.300> pay<00:03:55.690> close<00:03:56.170> close<00:03:56.560> attention<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.519> and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
got pay close close attention to it and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.610 
got pay close close attention to it and
I'm<00:03:58.060> sure<00:03:58.209> there's<00:03:58.450> things<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.959> don't<00:03:59.320> add

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
I'm sure there's things that don't add

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.470 
I'm sure there's things that don't add
up<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.040> are<00:04:00.160> never<00:04:00.370> explained<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.300> real

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
up and are never explained and real

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.060 
up and are never explained and real
computer<00:04:01.840> programmers<00:04:02.500> will<00:04:02.620> probably<00:04:02.950> look

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
computer programmers will probably look

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.680 
computer programmers will probably look
at<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.489> be<00:04:03.519> like<00:04:03.700> hey<00:04:03.880> they<00:04:04.150> forgot<00:04:04.300> this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
at this and be like hey they forgot this

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.750 
at this and be like hey they forgot this
or<00:04:05.019> forgot<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:05.980> honestly<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.640> think

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
or forgot that but honestly I think

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.790 
or forgot that but honestly I think
that's<00:04:07.300> just<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.660> sci-fi<00:04:07.930> element<00:04:08.650> that's

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
that's just the sci-fi element that's

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.920 
that's just the sci-fi element that's
people<00:04:09.250> making<00:04:09.610> stuff<00:04:09.850> up<00:04:10.060> for<00:04:10.239> entertainment

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
people making stuff up for entertainment

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.479 
people making stuff up for entertainment
as<00:04:11.110> well<00:04:11.410> as<00:04:11.739> try<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:11.980> get<00:04:12.190> what<00:04:12.340> other

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
as well as try to get what other

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.890 
as well as try to get what other
symbolic<00:04:12.910> point<00:04:13.360> they're<00:04:13.510> trying<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.750> get

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
symbolic point they're trying to get

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500 
symbolic point they're trying to get
across<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.530> think<00:04:14.980> because<00:04:15.130> I'm<00:04:15.610> not<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.060> huge

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
across I think because I'm not a huge

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.750 
across I think because I'm not a huge
computer<00:04:16.930> guy<00:04:17.229> I<00:04:17.500> can't<00:04:17.859> get<00:04:18.070> into<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.489> stuff

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
computer guy I can't get into this stuff

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.349 
computer guy I can't get into this stuff
quite

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
quite

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.539 
quite
much<00:04:19.629> but<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.109> do<00:04:20.259> acknowledge<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.280> good

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
much but I do acknowledge it is a good

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.059 
much but I do acknowledge it is a good
film<00:04:21.909> it<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.270> very<00:04:22.479> smart<00:04:22.840> even<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.889> is

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
film it is very smart even if it is

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.580 
film it is very smart even if it is
cheesy<00:04:24.490> here<00:04:24.939> there<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.599> again<00:04:26.139> even<00:04:26.319> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
cheesy here there and again even the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.740 
cheesy here there and again even the
designs<00:04:26.919> are<00:04:27.099> a<00:04:27.159> little<00:04:27.430> dated<00:04:27.759> but<00:04:28.000> it's

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
designs are a little dated but it's

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.749 
designs are a little dated but it's
still<00:04:28.960> something<00:04:29.229> all<00:04:29.500> its<00:04:29.710> own<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.610> good

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
still something all its own it's a good

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.640 
still something all its own it's a good
flick<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.360> my<00:04:31.599> guess<00:04:31.659> is<00:04:32.020> there's<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.319> lot<00:04:32.620> of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
flick and my guess is there's a lot of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.959 
flick and my guess is there's a lot of
people<00:04:32.919> out<00:04:33.159> there<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.520> would<00:04:33.639> enjoy<00:04:33.819> it

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:33.969 
people out there that would enjoy it

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.390 
people out there that would enjoy it
even<00:04:34.180> more<00:04:34.330> than<00:04:34.599> I<00:04:34.719> do<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:35.500> just<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.069> little

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
even more than I do it's just a little

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.309 
even more than I do it's just a little
too<00:04:36.669> much<00:04:36.849> going<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.270> for<00:04:37.330> me<00:04:37.569> to<00:04:37.840> really<00:04:37.990> love

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
too much going on for me to really love

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.070 
too much going on for me to really love
but<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.919> liked<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.819> I'm<00:04:39.939> glad<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.210> saw<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.689> but

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
but I liked it and I'm glad I saw it but

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.540 
but I liked it and I'm glad I saw it but
it's<00:04:41.259> proven<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.830> does<00:04:42.009> have<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.219> die-hard

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
it's proven that it does have a die-hard
