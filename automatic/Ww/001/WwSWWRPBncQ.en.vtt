00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
cool it's called Apple ANSI I believe

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.720 
cool it's called Apple ANSI I believe
that's<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.359> pronounce<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:20.100> what

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
that's how you pronounce it but what

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660 
that's how you pronounce it but what
this<00:00:20.910> does<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.510> allow<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.310> facial

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this does is allow you to use facial

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.509 
this does is allow you to use facial
recognition<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.779> unlock<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.500> device<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
recognition to unlock your device so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580 
recognition to unlock your device so
that's<00:00:26.970> really<00:00:27.420> cool<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.170> does<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that's really cool and it does it in a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.290 
that's really cool and it does it in a
really<00:00:28.619> cool<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.119> if

also down here you have only start on
swipe<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> means<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.780> enabled

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
swipe so that means when it's enabled

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
swipe so that means when it's enabled
it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.550> when<00:01:02.879> the

passcode<00:01:03.420> view<00:01:03.690> becomes<00:01:04.080> active<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.920> that's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
passcode view becomes active so that's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
passcode view becomes active so that's
usually<00:01:05.670> by<00:01:05.820> swiping<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> help

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
usually by swiping so it's going to help

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
usually by swiping so it's going to help
with<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> lag<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.299> really

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with the lag so this is actually really

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
with the lag so this is actually really
cool<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.110> gonna<00:01:10.200> show<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.070> swipe

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
pop-up says is move it around to show

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.730 
pop-up says is move it around to show
different<00:02:06.659> angles<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.200> face<00:02:07.409> because

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
different angles of your face because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.080 
different angles of your face because
you're<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.220> necessarily<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> be

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you're not necessarily going to be

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
you're not necessarily going to be
looking<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.599> device<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.289> exact<00:02:10.619> same

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
looking at your device the exact same

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.880 
looking at your device the exact same
way<00:02:11.039> every<00:02:11.430> time<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.670> try<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> unlock<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
way every time you try to unlock it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.820 
way every time you try to unlock it
or<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.490> wake<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.540> from<00:02:14.720> sleep<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.620> we're

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
or you wake it up from sleep so we're

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.930 
or you wake it up from sleep so we're
just<00:02:15.860> gonna<00:02:16.069> tap<00:02:16.280> okay

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
just gonna tap okay

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.760 
just gonna tap okay
so<00:02:17.090> once<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> tap<00:02:17.630> start<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.170> can<00:02:18.319> see<00:02:18.560> right

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
so once you tap start you can see right

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.440 
so once you tap start you can see right
up<00:02:18.890> here<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.130> top<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.180> want<00:02:20.360> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
up here at the top that what you want to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.840 
up here at the top that what you want to
do<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.140> move<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.590> around<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:22.430> get<00:02:22.640> all

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
do is just move this around to get all

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.190 
do is just move this around to get all
different<00:02:23.209> angles<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.569> your<00:02:23.690> face<00:02:23.900> because

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
different angles of your face because

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
different angles of your face because
you're<00:02:24.290> not<00:02:24.440> necessarily<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> be

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you're not necessarily going to be

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.070 
you're not necessarily going to be
looking<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.330> exact<00:02:26.660> same<00:02:26.870> angle

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
looking at it in the exact same angle

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.020 
looking at it in the exact same angle
every<00:02:27.620> single<00:02:28.040> time<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.610> want<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:28.940> able

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
every single time so you want to be able

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.740 
every single time so you want to be able
to<00:02:29.270> let<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.380> camera<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> tweak<00:02:31.820> know<00:02:32.240> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
to let the camera or the tweak know that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.320 
to let the camera or the tweak know that
it's<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.170> unlocking<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> device<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.030> this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's you unlocking the device so this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.820 
it's you unlocking the device so this
has<00:02:35.450> actually<00:02:35.600> worked<00:02:35.930> really<00:02:36.170> well<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:36.620> me

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
has actually worked really well for me

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.860 
has actually worked really well for me
I've<00:02:37.100> tried<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.459> multiple<00:02:37.820> times<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.420> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
I've tried it multiple times and it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.780 
I've tried it multiple times and it
automatically<00:02:39.620> unlocks<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.250> mean<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:40.580> almost

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
automatically unlocks I mean it's almost

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
automatically unlocks I mean it's almost
instantaneously<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:42.770> cool

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
instantaneously and that's really cool

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.949 
instantaneously and that's really cool
so<00:02:43.280> once<00:02:44.030> you're<00:02:44.150> done<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.569> go<00:02:44.660> ahead<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
so once you're done just go ahead and

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.270 
so once you're done just go ahead and
hit<00:02:45.050> stop<00:02:45.320> or<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.620> should<00:02:45.800> automatically

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
hit stop or it should automatically

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.790 
hit stop or it should automatically
finish<00:02:46.610> once<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> reach<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.480> tin<00:02:47.900> picture

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
finish once you reach the tin picture

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.040 
finish once you reach the tin picture
mark<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.250> then<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.820> see<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.660> go<00:02:50.810> back

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
mark and then you can see we can go back

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.840 
mark and then you can see we can go back
to<00:02:51.080> people<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:51.950> tap<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:52.489> this<00:02:52.700> little
