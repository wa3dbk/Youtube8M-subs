00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hello, my beloved ones. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 okay with you here who speaks is the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.740
 magnifying glass and in this video I would like to speak 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.080
 about the strongest pokémons of all 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 that there are strong pokémons or modinhas 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.140
 how many people like to talk, it 's not 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 novelty 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.930
 millet the grain gross goal and so on 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.590
 there are many strong pokémons but 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.500
 recently an Icelandic man hit the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.050
 record weight lifting 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.820
 this guy raised peace, not even 461 kilograms 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 is a new world record for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.140
 weightlifting 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 but does this world record there is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:01.890
 strong enough is compared to some 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:04.680
 pokémons o pokémon trail where the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 wood density of 750 kilograms 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.869
 per cubic meter, this means that a 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.030
 oak tree as the vast majority 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.810
 of those that we find around 50 years 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.430
 age can weigh up to 3.1 tonnes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 this means that for a correct 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 to take down a tree have to perform 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.520
 punches of at least 31 thousand tons with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 Such force a punch of macu rita would have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.710
 force of two hunting rifle bullets one 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.470
 would also be strong enough to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 raise 7 beeps or three mega grounds 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.329
 summarizing his punch would be 6.1 times more 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 strong that the strongest boxers in the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.210
 world 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.939
 if you think a race is the pokémon 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.040
 strongest of all is mistaken 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.869
 in fact has a stronger pokémon of the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.600
 world and it's a champions 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.119
 he is so strong that he would do the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.579
 saitama of the universe the anti the same 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.579
 own occupy and be a joke 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.640
 can move mountains use their four 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.110
 arms for the rapids then released his 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.690
 enemy on the horizon 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.180
 the only way to move a mountain 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.310
 would be destroying is practically 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.290
 impossible to move mountains because you are 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.660
 are connected to earth and with that 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
 obey the first law of Newton and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.209
 Kinetic static friction force and 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.640
 inertia, ie when applying force 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.440
 on an object this force returns to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.110
 you with the same strength 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.470
 so it hurts so much to break a brick 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.720
 as a ninja the largest mountain in japan 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.209
 is fuji mountain using calculations 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.220
 mathematicians can assume the weight of 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.940
 and conclude that it would be 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.459
 needed 10.4 gigatons of energy healing 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.010
 to move him the only martin punch that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.610
 has the power of a hydrogen bomb 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.560
 of 17 kilometers in diameter being 1.2 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.420
 millions of times more powerful than 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
 bomb launched in hiroshima 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.680
 this achievement could only be achieved if 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.030
 puts his punches in a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.610
 99.9 percent light speed 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.070
 the punch of a medium who would release so much 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.440
 energy but so much energy that one would 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.320
 temperature of 800 quadrillion 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.989
 celsius 5 million times warmer 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.299
 that the center of the sun up time was 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 in the center of são paulo the whole region 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.560
 southeast would be completely swept away from the map 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.170
 So what did you think of this man the most? 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.840
 strongest of the world managed to raise 460 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.750
 which is more than one of the smallest 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.420
 really that guy is very strong but 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.880
 Of course he does not compare these Pokémon 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.870
 even more so if we compare with 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.620
 Roll ection 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.620
 a little bit and a little bit dex 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.969
 allow him to keep up with large 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.450
 fighters like batman and bad queen 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:10.239
 exactly this little masked hawk 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.120
 can be as strong as both 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.419
 pokémons that we just size and then 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.639
 got scared of the roll, do not forget 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.070
 to give a like in this add video 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.210
 to favorites and share it with 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.729
 your friends 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.860
 the series because science goes to the air all 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.949
 on Thursdays about different 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.750
 different pokémon themes 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.550
 Do not forget to come back here to 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.560
 follow up all right 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.030
 a big hug magnifying glass and until the next 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.030
 video went
