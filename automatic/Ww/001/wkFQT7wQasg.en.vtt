herobrine and the way that you weaken
the<00:00:55.739> herobrine<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.250> easily<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.789> down

the herobrine will easily take it down
is<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> collect<00:00:57.539> shards<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.440> shards<00:00:58.859> are

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is you collect shards now shards are

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
is you collect shards now shards are
shown<00:00:59.190> through<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> char<00:01:00.300> detector<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
shown through this char detector is that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
shown through this char detector is that
the<00:01:01.230> direction<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.309> person<00:01:02.520> who<00:01:02.910> grabs

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the direction so the person who grabs

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.260 
the direction so the person who grabs
the<00:01:03.780> shard<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> pink<00:01:05.519> name

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
survivors the herobrine is invisible and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.349 
survivors the herobrine is invisible and
you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> only<00:01:17.399> really<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:17.969> from<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
you can only really see them from this
