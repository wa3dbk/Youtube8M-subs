programs<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.620> action<00:00:14.219> why<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.360> many

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
programs in action why is it that many

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040 
programs in action why is it that many
programs<00:00:17.100> fail<00:00:17.550> miserably<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> comes<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
programs fail miserably when it comes to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.630 
programs fail miserably when it comes to
producing<00:00:19.320> quality<00:00:19.680> results<00:00:21.500> well<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.519> a

kind<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> complex<00:00:24.720> question<00:00:25.609> there<00:00:26.609> are

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
kind of a complex question there are

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
kind of a complex question there are
many<00:00:26.910> components<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.689> go<00:00:27.930> into<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
many components that go into a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.189 
many components that go into a
gymnastics<00:00:29.010> program<00:00:29.900> they<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.109> be

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
gymnastics program they have to be

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.100 
gymnastics program they have to be
carefully<00:00:31.650> planned<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.309> implemented

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
carefully planned and implemented

monitored to ensure success failure in
any<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> these<00:00:37.079> categories<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:38.040> lead<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
any one of these categories can lead to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
any one of these categories can lead to
failure<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> results<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.200> less<00:00:40.469> than

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
failure and the results are less than

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
failure and the results are less than

will<00:01:02.760> focus<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> conditioning<00:01:03.809> program

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
will focus on the conditioning program

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
will focus on the conditioning program
and<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> related<00:01:04.949> reasons<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> success

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and the related reasons for the success

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.010 
and the related reasons for the success
or<00:01:06.750> failure<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.119> actuality<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
or failure but in all actuality the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
or failure but in all actuality the
answer<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.680> any<00:01:10.830> failure<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:11.729> aspect<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
answer for any failure in any aspect of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.700 
answer for any failure in any aspect of
a<00:01:12.450> program<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.490> pretty<00:01:14.490> universal<00:01:15.710> basically

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
a program is pretty universal basically

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
a program is pretty universal basically
it<00:01:16.799> comes<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:19.100> coaches<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it comes down to coaches on so the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
it comes down to coaches on so the
failure<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> most<00:01:22.530> conditioning<00:01:23.220> programs

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
failure of most conditioning programs

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120 
failure of most conditioning programs
based<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> falls<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> lap<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
based on it falls in the lap of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
based on it falls in the lap of the
individual<00:01:26.670> coaches<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:28.500> twofold

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
individual coaches and that's twofold

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.830 
individual coaches and that's twofold
there's<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.579> reasons<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
there's two reasons for that one is a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.890 
there's two reasons for that one is a
lack<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> knowledge<00:01:31.470> um<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> fact<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
lack of knowledge um by the fact that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
lack of knowledge um by the fact that
you<00:01:34.049> guys<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.409> sitting<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> listening

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you guys are sitting here and listening

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
you guys are sitting here and listening
to<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.970> webinar<00:01:36.030> obviously<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.110> seeking

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to this webinar obviously you're seeking

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
to this webinar obviously you're seeking
knowledge<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.280> definitely<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
knowledge so you're definitely on the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
knowledge so you're definitely on the
right<00:01:39.299> track<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
right track there but then there's the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.289 
right track there but then there's the
harder<00:01:42.600> aspect<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.280> condition<00:01:44.670> program<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
harder aspect of a condition program and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.429 
harder aspect of a condition program and
that's<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> willingness<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.460> implement<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
that's the willingness to implement the

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.630 
that's the willingness to implement the
demands<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:50.060> quality<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> daily<00:01:51.810> basis<00:01:52.640> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
demands for quality on a daily basis you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.389 
demands for quality on a daily basis you
know<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> by<00:01:54.899> lack<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> knowledge<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
know the by lack of knowledge you know

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.649 
know the by lack of knowledge you know
I'll<00:01:56.640> go<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> lack<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> knowledge

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I'll go back to the lack of knowledge

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
I'll go back to the lack of knowledge
that<00:01:58.020> knowledge<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.860> easy<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.310> obtain<00:01:59.460> there

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that knowledge is easy to obtain there

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.109 
that knowledge is easy to obtain there
are<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.649> individual<00:02:01.850> resources<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
are a lot of individual resources that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.859 
are a lot of individual resources that
you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.579> obtain<00:02:05.579> knowledge<00:02:05.869> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you can go out and obtain knowledge the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.960 
you can go out and obtain knowledge the
harder<00:02:07.290> thing<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.829> implementing<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
harder thing is implementing that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.100 
harder thing is implementing that
knowledge<00:02:09.390> um

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.990 

one<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> biggest<00:02:16.500> problems<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.670> some<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
one of the biggest problems are some of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520 
one of the biggest problems are some of
the<00:02:18.060> problems<00:02:18.270> related<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the problems related to this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.180 
the problems related to this
conditioning<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.760> causes<00:02:21.360> failure<00:02:22.190> in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
conditioning or that causes failure in

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the conditioning programs as basically

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.740 
the conditioning programs as basically
some<00:02:25.890> coaches<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.520> feel<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.090> conditioning

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
some coaches just feel like conditioning

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.450 
some coaches just feel like conditioning
as<00:02:27.870> an<00:02:27.990> afterthought<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:28.920> no<00:02:29.130> plan

reason there's no content they just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.220 
reason there's no content they just
throw<00:02:35.280> out<00:02:35.400> some<00:02:35.610> exercises<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.510> expect

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
programs and they say the same thing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
programs and they say the same thing
they<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.880> lack<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.270> commitment<00:02:54.780> an

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
they just see a lack of commitment an

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.610 
they just see a lack of commitment an
effect<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.790> part<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.060> coaches<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:58.230> deliver

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
results you know a lot of coaches just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.260 
results you know a lot of coaches just
have<00:03:03.950> unsupervised<00:03:04.950> rotations<00:03:05.700> or<00:03:05.970> soup

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
have unsupervised rotations or soup

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.000 
have unsupervised rotations or soup
circuits<00:03:07.050> they<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.350> set<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> kids<00:03:07.830> out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
circuits they just set the kids out

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
circuits they just set the kids out
there<00:03:08.190> go<00:03:08.400> do<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> exercises<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there go do the exercises and this is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.600 
there go do the exercises and this is
definitely<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.130> major<00:03:11.520> flaw<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.180> any<00:03:12.930> program

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
definitely a major flaw in any program

definitely a major flaw in any program
conditioning<00:03:14.750> rotations<00:03:15.750> require<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.650> much

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

if<00:03:17.580> not<00:03:17.850> more<00:03:18.410> hands-on<00:03:19.410> attention<00:03:20.250> than<00:03:20.730> any

other event it has to be considered that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.330 
other event it has to be considered that
fifth<00:03:23.880> event<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.420> training<00:03:25.130> some<00:03:26.130> coaches

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
fifth event of training some coaches

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.280 
fifth event of training some coaches
think<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.210> glorious<00:03:27.750> teaching<00:03:28.200> a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
think it's not as glorious teaching a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.800 
think it's not as glorious teaching a
push-up<00:03:28.530> or<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.040> pull-up<00:03:29.280> as<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.210> Kip<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
push-up or a pull-up as it is a Kip or a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.950 
push-up or a pull-up as it is a Kip or a
back<00:03:30.960> handspring<00:03:31.530> or<00:03:31.740> whatever<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.450> so

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
back handspring or whatever and and so

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.620 
back handspring or whatever and and so
many<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.410> many<00:03:34.440> times<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.430> more<00:03:36.030> experienced

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
many so many times the more experienced

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.930 
many so many times the more experienced
coaches<00:03:36.900> pawn<00:03:37.620> off<00:03:37.860> conditioning<00:03:38.430> rotations

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
coaches pawn off conditioning rotations

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.510 
coaches pawn off conditioning rotations
to<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.510> less<00:03:39.720> experienced<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.100> think<00:03:41.370> this

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
to the less experienced and I think this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.280 
to the less experienced and I think this
is<00:03:41.670> also<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.270> bit<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.600> mistake<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
is also a little bit of a mistake and

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.630 
is also a little bit of a mistake and
leads<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.160> some<00:03:44.340> failure<00:03:46.640> conditioning

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
leads to some failure conditioning

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.340 
leads to some failure conditioning
rotations<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.300> often<00:03:48.630> time<00:03:48.810> used<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.320> a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
rotations are often time used for a

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.870 
rotations are often time used for a

sense sends the message to the athlete
that<00:03:58.200> conditioning<00:03:58.740> is<00:03:58.800> not<00:03:58.950> important<00:03:59.460> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
that conditioning is not important and

definitely<00:04:03.990> doomed<00:04:04.470> for<00:04:04.740> failure<00:04:04.820> um<00:04:08.330> you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
definitely doomed for failure um you

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.950 
definitely doomed for failure um you
know<00:04:09.860> there's<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.970> underlying<00:04:12.600> thing

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
know there's this this underlying thing

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.290 
know there's this this underlying thing
also<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.770> coaches<00:04:14.580> are<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:14.940> gun-shy

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
also that coaches are a little gun-shy

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.479 
also that coaches are a little gun-shy

about making kids work harder than they

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.670

programs basically the biggest cause of

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.369 
programs basically the biggest cause of
failure<00:05:51.870> is<00:05:52.279> coaches<00:05:53.279> refusing<00:05:54.029> to<00:05:55.020> look<00:05:55.229> in
