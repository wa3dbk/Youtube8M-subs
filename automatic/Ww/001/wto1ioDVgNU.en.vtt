00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.060
 blackberry z10 is the first smartphone 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.220
 equipped with the new system 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.890
 operating blackberry 10 was born for 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.590
 counter android ios and windows phone 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.480
 the design is elegant, slightly reminiscent 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.610
 that of the iphone 5 in any case e 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.920
 is very nice and finally gifted 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.440
 of a full touch display of dimensions 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.680
 generous 4.2 inches with resolution 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.109
 1200 80 x 768 pixels 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 the improvements are multiple under the 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.069
 hardware profile as can be seen 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.139
 from the technical sheet we are in front of 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.809
 a radical innovation for the brand 

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:47.649
 blackberry dual core qualcomm processor 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:53.079
 from 1.5 gb 2 gb of ram and 4g connectivity 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:56.319
 lte wifi bluetooth 4.0 gps and nfc module 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 finally there is no hdmi and micro sd for 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.370
 expand the internal memory 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.129
 certainly the most interesting aspect 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.010
 of the blackberry z10 and its system 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.930
 operating the blackberry 10 a system 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 operational that despite the youth a 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.430
 we felt it was modern and intuitively 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 fluidity and excellent control is 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.750
 completely touch without physical keys 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.760
 with very natural main actions 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.050
 like the swipe used in many 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.000
 situations 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.430
 multitasking is really successful and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.920
 the remainder can indeed be managed 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.810
 up to 8 up simultaneously without 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 no slowing down the dedicated window 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.820
 it can be recalled by sliding your finger 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.470
 from left to right the performance in the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.420
 complex are really great and the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.090
 browsing the menus and launching 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.850
 apps are fluid and immediate pages 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.430
 web uploads the gestures quickly 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.050
 multitouch are accurate and responsive from 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.760
 this point of view we can say that 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.100
 blackberry engineers have done 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.900
 really a good job the z via there is one 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.970
 smartphone successful with all 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.190
 chance will manage to regain itself 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.810
