me away from the actual writing for a
couple<00:00:35.449> months<00:00:35.750> it's<00:00:35.900> usually<00:00:36.050> not<00:00:36.470> that<00:00:36.830> much

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370

one thing I'm big on it's economizing

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.889 
one thing I'm big on it's economizing
time<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.129> if<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.430> save<00:00:46.610> myself<00:00:46.899> some

researching<00:00:48.559> steps<00:00:48.920> before<00:00:49.219> I<00:00:49.399> need<00:00:49.640> ready<00:00:49.940> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
researching steps before I need ready to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.360 
researching steps before I need ready to
start<00:00:50.450> working<00:00:50.750> on<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.989> project<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.739> know

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
start working on the project you know

start working on the project you know
I'm<00:00:52.520> gonna<00:00:52.670> do<00:00:52.879> it<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.149> here's<00:00:53.899> how<00:00:54.200> I<00:00:54.530> get<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
I'm gonna do it so here's how I get in a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.090 
I'm gonna do it so here's how I get in a
little<00:00:55.520> early<00:00:55.969> research<00:00:56.449> without<00:00:57.379> even

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
little early research without even

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.790 
little early research without even
trying<00:00:58.760> let's<00:00:59.570> say<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.079> I'm<00:01:00.230> wanting<00:01:00.649> to

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
trying let's say that I'm wanting to

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.999 
trying let's say that I'm wanting to
write<00:01:01.010> stories<00:01:01.550> based<00:01:02.329> upon<00:01:02.899> or<00:01:03.350> said<00:01:03.649> in

these<00:01:08.210> stories<00:01:08.660> aren't<00:01:09.170> likely<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.500> manifest

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
these stories aren't likely to manifest

these stories aren't likely to manifest
for<00:01:10.700> several<00:01:11.330> years<00:01:11.720> at<00:01:12.140> least<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.280> would

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
for several years at least so it would

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.600 
for several years at least so it would
seem<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.840> best<00:01:15.080> i<00:01:15.440> can<00:01:15.500> do<00:01:15.800> right<00:01:15.979> now<00:01:16.039> is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
seem that the best i can do right now is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.180 
seem that the best i can do right now is
to<00:01:17.300> make<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.750> list<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.349> possible<00:01:18.860> reading

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
to make a list of possible reading

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.400 
to make a list of possible reading

but let's one-up that by being practical
about<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.250> since<00:01:25.849> I'm<00:01:26.090> obviously

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
about this since I'm obviously
