00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 in this new installment 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.120
 we will go to the professor rai to make us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.220
 give the amulet lair an amulet able 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.769
 to give your pokemon more eggs 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.430
 to get it you must have finished everything 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:32.279
 the juninho pokédex just like I have 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:37.890
 made myself with 300 some communists and 301 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.950
 took all 300 including vizzini and i 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.829

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 melo has and is fine and all the others 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.420
 has yet been distributed 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 so I used tricks because no one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.340
 also via gps he could exchange it therefore 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.479
 he uses tricks just for him for the rest 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.040
 how you evaluate it, you want me to examine the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:52.330
 top of the seas never captured 300 a bit 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:59.500
 as never before after this award 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:08.200

 continuous voltage to acts to do 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.730
 in fact if we go to see the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.650
 description mysterious forklift of form 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 spherical which increases the probability of 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.440
 find eggs in the pension 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.440
 this tool can come a lot 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.549
 comfortable if you are the coaches you are looking for 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.200

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.299

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.489
 this tool is very useful but like 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.590

 world the juninho region to find it 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.870
 very well 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.780
 this video was very short only 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.780
 to illustrate to you precisely this object is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.780
 a 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.170
 tips for the next video we can 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.290
 say in the next video I will illustrate 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.090

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.700
 that is given to you when you catch everyone 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.550
 the pokémon of the little of the national are 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.450
 649 pokémon is really a thing 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.080
 difficult but if you have many games like 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.070

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.410
 one hundred more than finding pokémon 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.489

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.200

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.420
