00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi all guys are among those that 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.370
 today I'm here with or video where we're going 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.500
 to make a comparison between the super release 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 with crime pays part ii or the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.420
 pro gent in 20 and the super exit with the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 crime pays part 1 or the pegasus 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.389
 idis before starting the body 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
 arms because it takes like two seconds 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.060
 leaving arms peace facebook la 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 you will find very old questions 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 subscribe to the channel for other content 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 ok let's start immediately with the gase bee 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 osiris not modified and we're going to see 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 if the 20 people really will be worth all 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 these millions or $ 2,200,000 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 and I think this is a price 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 this too really exaggerated 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 obviously my opinion is not me 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.790
 attack as some people have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 made in the video of the dlc only because 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 I said that this expansion is not me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.399
 liked that they were people 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.020
 who have commented badly and do not understand 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 not even why why 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.219
 any person in my opinion should 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.840
 have your own opinion or boys 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 if I don't like this expansion don't 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 I like it but it's not that if I don't like it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 this expansion I don't like the game 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.190
 for heaven's sake however I don't want to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 discuss it even more than that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 we immediately got the first result with the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.770
 fold you dare not changed fights 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 instead we will see if you present it 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 20 with the previous 20 we will have a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 better result or in any case less 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.210
 in short, we will see a moment and end at 23 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 seconds and 12 cents the difference is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 really nothing that is boys but shovels 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.369
 truly $ 2,200,000 this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 vehicle 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.770
 obviously I will make this comparison not 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.570
 only with the pegasus iris though also 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.840
 glue drink with advent you will see the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 video in the future in the sense anyway 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 not that much at a distance either 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 one day from this video I will try to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 charge them both as soon as possible 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.390
 we now have the result of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.180
 modified pegasus itis and 21 seconds e 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.549
 17 cents we will see if instead 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 able to beat this result 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.719
 our pro 20 people modified not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.270
 modified as you have seen however it is 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.460
 there are no huge differences and there 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 make it clear that not all these are worth 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.210
 money this vehicle already the sserie fold 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.799
 according to me it costs so much then they have 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 inserted a vehicle among other things a lot 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.060
 similar to the one with a value really 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 much higher than the picasso yes 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.950
 affected 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.660
 I understand why do this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 rockstar i mean i realized that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.709
 maybe even a company look at the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.420
 difference is only two hundredth ho 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.550
 understood that anyway a company must 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.099
 make money from free expansion though 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 that is, do n't look unless you are looking for 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.480
 mask the fact that you see too much 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.250
 that you want to make money among the contents 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 they really even added one 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.670
 boat worth one million and 700 thousand 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 dollars 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.530
 I should not discuss this in this video 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.140
 but I only say this because I am second 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.060
 me for a boat such a price is a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.890
 insult gt even less than the modders 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 should buy out of respect for 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.660
 poor that boat we have now 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.880
 instead the comparison between the people 20 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.739
 head to head with the cute bee said 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 as you can see the difference is not 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.760
 great have an acceleration 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.489
 really very very similar though if 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.650
 you noticed towards the end of the race the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.390
 pegasus iris was succeeding in 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.850
 reach the procedure is redone 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.350
 always the same thing and it is practically 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.299
 the same thing happened we will go instead to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.430
 see now what will happen on a 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.500
 long comparison also kept us to say 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
 one thing if you 're noticing that times 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.220
 I'm really exaggerating with these two 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 vehicles is simply because we are there 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.690
 established to leave at a specific time 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.880
 or rather we said, for example 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
 let's start with 20 seconds then 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.440
 we left together with 20 seconds 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.440
 simply for this if you see the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.370
 time exaggerated quiet guys is 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.370
 all normal 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.810
 everything is going smoothly simply 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.040
 unfortunately boys, however, there was a 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.959
 ban these comparisons 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.820
 we had to repeat them often because 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.160
 unfortunately at 123 go 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.930
 unfortunately the turbo was paid and one 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.070
 a game started first where there was then 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.380
 we are organized in this way 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.120
 instead it concerns the final test of the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.069
 traced along between obviously the tve 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 entity was disputed this I had to 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.370
 always repeat several times to understand 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.799
 what is the result because boys 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.239
 these vehicles are really a lot 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.980
 very similar I even had to 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.880
 change track as you see in the video 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.310
 in this track 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.769
 I repeated it twice and always two 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.959
 sometimes I faked very little with the t 20 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.400
 but in my opinion the boys are the differences 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.850
 between these two vehicles they are practically 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.150
 maybe nothing is better than speed 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.950
 t 20 is maximum compared to zero 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.980
 we are not even talking about that much 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.530
 no differences 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.410
 Type 2 mph something so 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.490
 really non-existent well I would do 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.380
 two questions I don't want to judge 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.700
 obviously this vehicle will also go 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.980
 to see among other comparisons 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.080
 I only hope I have lightened i 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.420
 your doubts for me all that money there 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.500
 pro genti 20 is not worth remembering 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.240
 leave a pleasure because it takes 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.980
 only three of a kind with leaving me his 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.600
 you will find the facebook page in the system 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.850
