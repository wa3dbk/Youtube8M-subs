00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 the sergio ball is going to rush everything 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.100
 I can 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 there are about three seconds of difference in 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.110
 the offset between position side and the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.060
 attack clock does not need the barça 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.680
 resigns to need the set 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.599
 blaugrana the triple of sergio and heat not 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.860
 between bouncing done to have option of 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.669
 tie the match marcellino morning 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.810
 from there 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.039
 marcelino 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.640
 do not 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.640
 inside 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.200
 dead 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.059
 I just gave the game to the club 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:46.280
 I want triple stratospheric 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:50.740
 Marcelo Huertas had just time 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 decided to pull the triple Marcelino 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.370
 and just gave the victory to the barça 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.330
 that triple of marcelinho orchards has 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.980
 given the victory at fc barcelona it seemed 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.410
 that could be a bad decision in a 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.680
 principle because I still had time to 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.380
 move forward a bit more but he took over 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.080
 to be honest he swore he was saying 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.900
 because you want and still had time to 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.370
 vote to enter up to the bottom in the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.190
 first basket and marcelino in the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.990
 good match and in addition to the player there 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 that to say what I think has been the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 barcelona and what worse has played means 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.930
 who has decided that the party that is 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.450
 it's sensational our game just for 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.630
 these tips if only for these 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.930
 essential things at the end 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.869
 It's good little end of match that has 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.360
 been good different is that is is the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.729
 basketball who was going to think that 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.429
 was going to decide the match like that with that 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.630
 triple 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.420
 the ball you have to be lucky 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.369
 obviously but ex sensational from 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.920
 the end and then show logic 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.130
 celebration of joy for a barça 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 rival that has come back and 17 points
