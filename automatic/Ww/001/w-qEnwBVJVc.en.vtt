00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.779
 VfL Wolfsburg vs. Eintracht Frankfurt Bundesliga side practiced April 2011 lower 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.129
 she weird Kenzie age the weird Kenzie my luck 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.399
 Although a draw from where this is a derby match of the lower part of the 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:20.300
 Table goes to give this game the most attention in this game 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.210
 Round of the Bundesliga 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.019
 There are several reasons but the duel of the two new coach Felix 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.150
 Magath and Christoph Daum give this game a special charm 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.740
 Third April 2011 until 5:30 pm the wolves are on the penultimate 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.269
 Table space and this place leads into the second division which means 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.719
 that they make each game a qualifier for them until the end of the season 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.200
 will be 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 after six defeats in seven rounds played and only one win 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 have achieved and against the last-placed Gladbacher was the time 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.980
 come the coach lies Bosque to dismiss 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.550
 was just signed Felix Magath with the two years ago the title 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.070
 have brought 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.770
 the reaction followed right after he was fired in Gelsenkirchen and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.700
 proved to be a good move because on the last matchday the wolves have one 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.710
 Point the guest appearance against Stuttgart honors whereby they the victory in the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.760
 fourth minute have unfortunately lost 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.750
 through this point, the situation in the table has not 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.780
 improved but certainly the shattered confidence again 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 manufactured 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.500
 With the return of Magath to the team, the style of play changed immediately 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 Now they play exactly the former and many on the winner 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.430
 Helmes is Heat for this game and he is supposed to attack with Grafite 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.210
 touch while Diego will play right behind them 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 Pekarik is suspended because of the fifth yellow card for this game and that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.330
 will cause some forced changes in the defense 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
 In principle, an aggressive and offensive game of wolves is expected 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.519
 and two from the first minute 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.999
 expected installation 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.739
 Position Wolfsburg Lentz 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.450

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.339
 Deco Graphite Helmet 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.809
 the concord has a big negative series that you in a little bit 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.339
 enviable position in the table has left behind 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.319
 they have not won in nine matches in a row and in this one 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 They played a draw only twice 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.769
 On the last day of the match, they finally ended this negative series as they did 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.119
 the Paulaner forced 2 to 1 in their own stadium 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.909
 the skibbe coach was nevertheless dismissed and his place has the old 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.589
 Fox Christoph Daum taken 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.779
 He should first of all bring mental stability into the team and then 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.729
 the survival in the league 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.779
 By the way, that's their main goal right now 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.789
 with the arrival of Daum there were some changes in the same way as with the opponent 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.219
 the formation 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.529
 Daum has changed captain as the first game 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.819
 Petric OK should take over this role now 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.919
 he still has a big goalkeeping dilemma but at the moment Nikolovs is not supposed to 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.459
 come between the posts and ferryman will continue to defend 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:29.299
 the biggest change taking place in midfield where Daum even 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.499
 announced three bills 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.199
 so Amanatidis Meier and Fenin will probably be on the bench 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.339
 take over while Goc Altin raging and charcoal accumulate 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.270
 the defenses remain the same and he 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.610
 Striker Gekas has 16 out of 27 goals in the team this season 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 will definitely be in the shot 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.719
 start 11 stay 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.220
 expected installation Eintracht Paarmann 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.500
 he is Jung Frantz Bruce Zampella is Schwegler Clarke Box Halil Altintop 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.439
 Kolat Gekas 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.409
 for the wolves, this game is much more important and they are therefore around 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.170
 try to win a threesome at any price to keep the fight going 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.079
 can survive 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.319
 The arrival of Markert certainly meant a lot to them and that was the last 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.239
 Game confirmed 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.180
 that's why the guy on victory of the wolves in the volkswagen-arena is certainly one 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.559
 Try value 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:32.239
 In addition to the host's victory, which is pretty sure we have ourselves 

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.629
 decided for this second title and that because the wolves again 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.610
 started playing an attacking football while we were at the 

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:44.119
 On the other hand, one of the best scorers in the league Gekas
