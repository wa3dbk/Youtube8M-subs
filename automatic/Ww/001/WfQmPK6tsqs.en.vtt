00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.509
 updated lenovo yoga 13 13 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.600
 were clearly indicate the screen 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.810
 size therefore 13.3 is the diagonal of the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 screen 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.300
 the example model of the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 multi mode the possibility therefore of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 use a single device in different 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009
 modality 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.350
 the traditional notebook mode e 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 rotation up to 360 degrees for 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 get to make the tablet 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 the improvements on this product are 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.580
 definitely a screen on the screen 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.199
 which as you can see is already in mode 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.390
 full high definition 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.100
 we are not satisfied there is the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 possibility to bring it up to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 resolution of 3200 for 1,800 then one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.489
 resolution that goes beyond 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.700
 best display technologies today 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.630
 present on the sui 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.630
 Yes No 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 there is not only a keyboard display 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 then backlit to be able to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 suffer from your notebook even in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.490
 low light conditions has been 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.490
 ergonomics also improved 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.159
 to be able to use better in the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 four modes the product therefore are 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:34.180
 the edges have been slightly modified 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.170
 so as to make it even more stable than 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.680
 what already was that it was also 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.930
 improved the software apparatus 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.650
 software supplied because we have 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 talked about 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 4 mod then the possibility of arriving 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 to use the product 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.740
 as you see in four modes 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 we have the traditional modality of 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.159
 notebook 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.180
 the stand mode the curtain mode and the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.849
 tablet mode 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.880
 whenever you move through 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.489
 these four modes the notebook e 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.630
 recognizes the way in which one is and yes 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.120
 activates a specific software so 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.470
 let's see in this case stand mode has 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.580
 acknowledged that we put it in 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.690
 stand mode and goes to suggest one 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.980
 series of applications that are studied 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.560
 as the best to take advantage of 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.600
 this mode then appears every time 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.510
 this message with applications 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.230
 relative clearly this is also true 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.160
 if you move it in curtain mode as 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.550
 let's see 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 changes and also the related le change 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.090
 related applications 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.360
 the materials and always remain the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.420
 first class material 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.730

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.790
 guarantee that in using these 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:36.360
 four modes there is no minimum 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.360
 risk usb connectivity 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:45.299
 the power button possibility of 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:49.620
 then block the rotation of the display 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.350
 card reader and usb 3.0 hdmi e 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.950
 supply 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.170
 all this for a product that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.550

 positioning of around 1,300 euros 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.470
 recommended the thickness of this 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.980

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.260
