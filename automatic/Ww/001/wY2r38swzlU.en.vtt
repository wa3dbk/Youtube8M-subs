bit<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.739> reverb<00:02:16.489> there<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.269> usually<00:02:17.540> it's

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
bit of reverb there but it usually it's

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.880 
bit of reverb there but it usually it's
a<00:02:17.659> little<00:02:17.840> bit<00:02:17.930> too<00:02:18.049> much<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.409> usually<00:02:18.769> move

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
a little bit too much so I usually move

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.280 
a little bit too much so I usually move
it<00:02:19.040> down<00:02:19.159> to<00:02:19.370> about<00:02:19.489> 6%<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:20.989> can<00:02:21.170> be

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
it down to about 6% but this can be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.180 
it down to about 6% but this can be
adjusted<00:02:21.680> afterwards<00:02:23.799> next<00:02:24.799> thing<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.010> want

a<00:03:46.940> mix<00:03:47.209> down<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.810> wonder<00:03:48.140> what<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.350> means<00:03:48.680> all

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
a mix down I wonder what that means all

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.430 
a mix down I wonder what that means all
I<00:03:49.160> know<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.670> does<00:03:49.820> it<00:03:50.170> then<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.290> can

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
I know is that it does it then you can

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.849 
I know is that it does it then you can
convert<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:54.519> GarageBand<00:03:55.519> file<00:03:55.880> into<00:03:56.510> an<00:03:56.859> mp3

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
convert the GarageBand file into an mp3

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.370 
convert the GarageBand file into an mp3
or<00:03:58.400> mp4<00:03:58.579> depending<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.630> what<00:03:59.810> program<00:04:00.170> you're

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
or mp4 depending on what program you're
using<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:01.130> iTunes<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.910> believe<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.480> becomes<00:04:03.049> an

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
using in iTunes I believe it becomes an

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.430 
using in iTunes I believe it becomes an
mp4<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.630> we'll<00:04:05.720> go<00:04:05.840> ahead<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.049> let<00:04:06.260> that

mp4 so we'll go ahead and let that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.059 
mp4 so we'll go ahead and let that
convert<00:04:08.680> when<00:04:09.680> it's<00:04:09.799> done<00:04:09.980> converting
