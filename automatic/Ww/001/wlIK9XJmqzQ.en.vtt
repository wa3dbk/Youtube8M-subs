 demonstrates a mastery of techniques no doubt surprising for his

 Don 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.179
 handball for 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.670
 sle 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.670
 by supporting us 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 my agent liked me 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.660
 the current expo 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 and these emotions 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 we feel better sliding by putting hands under the buttocks 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080
 g 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 when he is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 walking in the water 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.590
 we can alternate church by pushing on the legs 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.990
 thanks to the help of partners we can perfect a movement understood 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.070
 who floats quietly in the surface 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 paris ruled on the board 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.509
 football or the site can find the right flotation position when 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 the body is not in extension 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.219
 we are backed by football the swimmer can better focus on the 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.219
 arm movement 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.579
 the best way to make sure his arm movement and correct and 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 to observe one's arms every two 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.069
 the following exercises such execution of the arms movement underwater 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.919
 allow swimmers to improve their feeling of 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.919
 as well as it's a lot less 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.609
 the little train - control 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.150
 for fishing to commit one of the most common mistakes that we encounter 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.719
 other types of property 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.719
 the crossing of the arms 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.719
 the last part of the movement will have to face pushed 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.719
 these various separately 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.450
 when the swimmer paddles a head mark forward 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.319
 he takes more aware that the production of his body they are not 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 not sure of us 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.129
 the maj with the arms in May the chicken 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.129
 and then the guardian tamudo 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.799
 here is another way to discover the double technique 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 do you think you can succeed in such a chain with other clubs 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.469
 the exercise of mechanical doubs 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.659
 which involves raising the arm opposite to the moving one 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.199
 do we learn up to date how did pictet properly rotate around 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.509
 childbirth 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.509
 very good motor coordination 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.939
 this exercise should not be a problem 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.520
 the h &amp; b form of the tukoul performed synchronously 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.939
