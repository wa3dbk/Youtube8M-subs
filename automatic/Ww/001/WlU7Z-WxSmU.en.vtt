00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.200 
notice Adrian can't put his put his feet
on<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> ground<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.800> he's<00:00:22.920> benching<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
on the ground when he's benching the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910 
on the ground when he's benching the
reason<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:24.960> he<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.560> born

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
reason for that is because he was born

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
reason for that is because he was born
with<00:00:26.519> his<00:00:26.609> hips<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> socket<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.510> he<00:00:27.630> had<00:00:27.779> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pounds which is just ridiculous right

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
pounds which is just ridiculous right
and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.480> he<00:00:54.539> does<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.930> no<00:00:55.020> feet<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and then he does it with no feet on the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.869 
and then he does it with no feet on the
ground<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.940> here's<00:00:57.149> Adrian<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:59.010> 495

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
ground but so here's Adrian with 495

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
ground but so here's Adrian with 495
pounds<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.480> after<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.960> hit<00:01:01.199> 495<00:01:02.100> pounds

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
pounds just after I had hit 495 pounds

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
pounds just after I had hit 495 pounds
he<00:01:02.520> barely<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.619> he<00:01:04.860> takes<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
he barely got it and I think he takes it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.990 
he barely got it and I think he takes it
for<00:01:05.460> reps<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.580> watch<00:01:08.820> an

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
for reps and I mean just watch an

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.390 
for reps and I mean just watch an
imbalance<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.560> bench<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.310> much

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
imbalance on the bench with so much

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
imbalance on the bench with so much
weight<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.640> his<00:01:11.820> hands<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.479> ridiculous

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
weight in his hands it's just ridiculous

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
weight in his hands it's just ridiculous
to<00:01:13.260> me<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.790> actually<00:01:14.880> goes<00:01:15.119> for

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

hard thing to do and he you know he hits
it<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.119> four<00:01:48.299> reps<00:01:48.560> especially<00:01:49.560> he<00:01:49.649> can't<00:01:49.799> put

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it for four reps especially he can't put

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
it for four reps especially he can't put
his<00:01:49.920> feet<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.280> ground<00:01:50.369> here's<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
his feet on the ground here's a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
his feet on the ground here's a
staredown<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.710> he's<00:01:52.829> scared<00:01:53.220> we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
staredown that's right he's scared we

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.160 
staredown that's right he's scared we
know

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
know

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.039 
know
so<00:01:55.680> Adrian<00:01:56.340> took<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.119> crack<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.659> it

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
so Adrian took first crack at it

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
so Adrian took first crack at it
fortunately<00:02:01.049> he's<00:02:01.409> got<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.680> massive<00:02:02.219> head<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
fortunately he's got a massive head to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.440 
fortunately he's got a massive head to
keep<00:02:03.540> him<00:02:03.689> balanced<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.259> bench<00:02:05.329> which<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
keep him balanced on the bench which I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.760 
keep him balanced on the bench which I
think<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.110> quite<00:02:07.560> an

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
think I think would be quite an

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.020 
think I think would be quite an
advantage<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.280> he<00:02:08.369> could<00:02:08.489> put<00:02:08.640> his<00:02:08.670> feet<00:02:08.910> on

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
advantage if he could put his feet on

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.520 
advantage if he could put his feet on
the<00:02:09.060> floor<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.599> either<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the floor but either way I think it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.559 
the floor but either way I think it
levels<00:02:10.800> things<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.330> anything

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
levels things out so you know anything

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.740 
levels things out so you know anything
that<00:02:12.690> transpired<00:02:13.230> here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
that transpired here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.650 
that transpired here
this<00:02:13.960> day<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:16.030> equaled<00:02:16.390> out<00:02:16.480> by

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
this day you know was equaled out by

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.120 
this day you know was equaled out by
that<00:02:16.840> by<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.990> size<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.680> sheer

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
that by the size and just sheer

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.370 
that by the size and just sheer
massiveness<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.880> his<00:02:19.060> head<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.690> was<00:02:20.140> six

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
massiveness of his head that was six

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.040 
massiveness of his head that was six
reps<00:02:20.590> from<00:02:20.860> Adrian<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.180> at<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.450> point<00:02:22.720> I'm

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
pretty sure I've only hit five reps in a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.390 
pretty sure I've only hit five reps in a
slingshot<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:26.260> 4.95<00:02:27.330> ever<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:29.400> typically

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
slingshot with 4.95 ever I typically

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160 
slingshot with 4.95 ever I typically
leave<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.000> little<00:02:31.180> bit<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> tank<00:02:31.690> though<00:02:31.900> so

leave a little bit in the tank though so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.360 
leave a little bit in the tank though so
you<00:02:32.350> know<00:02:32.530> I've<00:02:32.620> never<00:02:32.740> really<00:02:32.860> gone<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:33.340> out
