some<00:01:24.869> decks<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.680> options<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
some decks have a lot more options but

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
some decks have a lot more options but
the<00:01:26.700> most<00:01:26.850> part<00:01:27.119> Beltran<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.570> basically<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the most part Beltran is basically the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
the most part Beltran is basically the
main<00:01:28.590> rank<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> comes<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:29.970> play<00:01:30.090> as

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
main rank a that comes out into play as

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
main rank a that comes out into play as
far<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> metagame<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> not

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
far as the metagame right now and not

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.920 
far as the metagame right now and not
only<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.909> able<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
only are going to be able to make this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
only are going to be able to make this
get<00:01:34.860> rid<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> something<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.020> able

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
get rid of something and it also be able

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.649 
get rid of something and it also be able
to<00:01:37.229> attack<00:01:37.439> directly<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> stun<00:01:39.090> aspect

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to attack directly but as a stun aspect

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.420 
to attack directly but as a stun aspect
to<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.960> when<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> comes<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.470> basically<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to it and when it comes out basically it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.770 
to it and when it comes out basically it
has<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.759> ability<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.570> protect

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
has this ability to kind of protect

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
has this ability to kind of protect
itself<00:01:43.229> already<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.009> mean<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> can

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
itself already I mean you know it can

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
itself already I mean you know it can
stop<00:01:45.270> anything<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.869> spell<00:01:46.079> trap<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.320> monster

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
stop anything to spell trap or monster

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.260 
stop anything to spell trap or monster
effect<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
effect and I think that that it is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.370 
effect and I think that that it is
really<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> touch<00:01:49.200> one

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
really good you have you touch one

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.520 
really good you have you touch one
material<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:51.090> downside<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.290> card

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
material but one downside that this card

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.499 
material but one downside that this card
has<00:01:52.649> no<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> does<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.399> destroy<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> car<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
has no it does not destroy the car that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.690 
has no it does not destroy the car that
it<00:01:54.600> has<00:01:54.780> negating<00:01:55.439> basically<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.250> bone<00:01:56.460> trap

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it has negating basically this bone trap

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.889 
it has negating basically this bone trap
yeah<00:01:56.969> you're<00:01:57.119> beginning<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> activations

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
yeah you're beginning the activations

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.980 
yeah you're beginning the activations
basically<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> same<00:01:58.530> thing

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
basically the same thing

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.630 
basically the same thing
it<00:01:59.320> gets<00:01:59.500> rid<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> car<00:01:59.979> when<00:02:00.490> you're

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
it gets rid of the car when you're

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.069 
it gets rid of the car when you're
stopping<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.030> monstrous<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.659> something<00:02:01.930> like<00:02:02.020> a

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
stopping a monstrous I something like a

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.780 
stopping a monstrous I something like a
driver<00:02:02.320> dragon<00:02:02.710> let's<00:02:02.829> say<00:02:02.950> grandma<00:02:03.460> dragon

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
driver dragon let's say grandma dragon

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.190 
driver dragon let's say grandma dragon
comes<00:02:03.970> out<00:02:04.090> after<00:02:04.240> you've<00:02:04.659> already<00:02:04.930> made<00:02:05.049> this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
comes out after you've already made this

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.469 
comes out after you've already made this
card<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.530> got<00:02:05.649> overrun<00:02:05.950> dragon<00:02:06.549> well<00:02:06.970> you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
card you got overrun dragon well you

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.210 
card you got overrun dragon well you
will<00:02:07.630> need<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.050> activation<00:02:08.619> gun<00:02:08.800> from<00:02:08.920> Dragon

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
will need the activation gun from Dragon

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.610 
will need the activation gun from Dragon
King<00:02:09.340> then<00:02:09.759> attack<00:02:10.030> over<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.479> but<00:02:11.170> still<00:02:11.380> it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
King then attack over you but still it's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.960 
King then attack over you but still it's
a<00:02:11.680> really<00:02:11.890> good<00:02:12.099> card<00:02:12.340> nonetheless<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.940> think

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
a really good card nonetheless I think

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.610 
a really good card nonetheless I think
that<00:02:13.209> this<00:02:13.330> car<00:02:13.540> definitely<00:02:13.989> has<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> lot<00:02:14.590> of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that this car definitely has a lot of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
that this car definitely has a lot of
potential<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.310> other<00:02:15.730> random<00:02:16.330> decks<00:02:16.540> that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
potential for other random decks that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.830 
potential for other random decks that
could<00:02:16.930> make<00:02:17.260> use<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.819> high-level<00:02:18.840> xyz's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
could make use of high-level xyz's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.449 
could make use of high-level xyz's
something<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.800> think<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> top<00:02:21.340> I

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
something that can think about the top I

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.190 
something that can think about the top I
had<00:02:21.580> some<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:21.880> gimmick<00:02:22.209> puppets<00:02:22.599> something

like that or I've even seen some

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.430 
like that or I've even seen some
different<00:02:24.880> builds<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.300> skill<00:02:25.780> drain<00:02:25.930> malefics

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.680 
you can all use effect of him once per
turn<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.579> pretty<00:03:58.180> good<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.540> ads

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
turn so that's pretty good that the ads

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.910 
turn so that's pretty good that the ads
that<00:03:58.810> otherwise<00:03:59.139> it<00:03:59.380> might<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.650> for<00:03:59.799> some

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
that otherwise it might be for some

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.349 
that otherwise it might be for some
potential<00:04:00.400> crazy<00:04:00.639> little<00:04:00.910> loop<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.239> can

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
potential crazy little loop so you can

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.059 
potential crazy little loop so you can
do<00:04:01.450> keep<00:04:01.930> on<00:04:02.049> popping<00:04:02.260> your<00:04:02.500> own<00:04:02.650> stuff<00:04:02.920> and

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
do keep on popping your own stuff and

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.640 
do keep on popping your own stuff and
keep<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.489> remaking<00:04:03.910> him<00:04:04.350> although<00:04:05.350> if<00:04:05.530> you're

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
keep on remaking him although if you're

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.990 
keep on remaking him although if you're
playing<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:05.950> deck<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.190> real<00:04:06.340> life<00:04:06.489> that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
playing that deck in real life that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.939 
playing that deck in real life that
would<00:04:07.209> be<00:04:07.269> very<00:04:07.299> very<00:04:08.079> expensive<00:04:08.440> but

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
would be very very expensive but

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.710 
would be very very expensive but
nonetheless<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.609> was<00:04:10.060> thinking<00:04:10.329> about<00:04:10.540> how

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
nonetheless I was thinking about how

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.650 
nonetheless I was thinking about how
this<00:04:10.900> car<00:04:11.109> can<00:04:11.260> be<00:04:11.350> good

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
this car can be good

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660 
this car can be good
mean<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.590> me<00:04:12.710> it's<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:13.010> decent<00:04:13.430> card

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
mean to me it's a decent card

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.490 
mean to me it's a decent card
nonetheless<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.600> be<00:04:14.690> able<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.960> survive

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
nonetheless just to be able to survive

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.350 
nonetheless just to be able to survive
if<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.550> want<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.760> throw<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:16.940> up<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.060> defense

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
if you want to throw it up in defense

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.490 
if you want to throw it up in defense
let's<00:04:17.510> say<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.690> don't<00:04:17.810> have<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.050> many<00:04:18.140> cards

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
let's say you don't have that many cards

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.530 
let's say you don't have that many cards
in<00:04:18.590> your<00:04:18.650> hand<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.730> you're<00:04:20.060> gonna<00:04:20.180> make<00:04:20.390> this

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
in your hand and you're gonna make this

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.480 
in your hand and you're gonna make this
card<00:04:20.780> basically<00:04:21.140> you're<00:04:21.680> gonna<00:04:21.769> use<00:04:22.040> maybe

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
card basically you're gonna use maybe

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.340 
card basically you're gonna use maybe
two<00:04:22.760> cards<00:04:23.150> maybe<00:04:23.270> three<00:04:23.630> cards<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.110> then<00:04:24.230> are

two cards maybe three cards and then are

his like marshmallow or some other cars
that<00:04:31.250> can't<00:04:31.490> beat<00:04:31.610> us<00:04:31.670> from<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.850> battle<00:04:32.120> has

some other utility like a card trooper

some other utility like a card trooper
wear<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.030> once<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.570> destroying<00:04:35.780> a

wear it once that is destroying a
drawcard<00:04:36.410> no<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.800> visited<00:04:37.550> its<00:04:38.000> effects<00:04:38.240> are

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
drawcard no I visited its effects are

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.000 
drawcard no I visited its effects are
negated<00:04:38.690> but<00:04:39.020> if<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.200> obviously<00:04:39.620> goes<00:04:39.890> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
negated but if it obviously goes the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.990 
negated but if it obviously goes the
grave<00:04:40.190> rather<00:04:40.370> than<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.640> us<00:04:40.730> by<00:04:40.850> our

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
grave rather than you get us by our

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.640 
grave rather than you get us by our
Danny<00:04:41.300> lion<00:04:41.540> or<00:04:41.690> something<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.020> that's

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
Danny lion or something like that that's

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.630 
Danny lion or something like that that's
why<00:04:42.800> I'm<00:04:42.890> really<00:04:43.100> thinking<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:43.460> has<00:04:43.610> a

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
why I'm really thinking that this has a

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.760 
why I'm really thinking that this has a
lot<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:43.940> potential<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:45.020> open<00:04:45.320> up<00:04:45.380> plays

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
lot of potential to just open up plays

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.190 
lot of potential to just open up plays
to<00:04:46.220> basically<00:04:46.550> survive<00:04:47.030> as<00:04:47.600> far<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.110> a

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
to basically survive as far as it's a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.620 
to basically survive as far as it's a
fat<00:04:48.410> goes<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.770> gains<00:04:49.010> 800<00:04:49.280> attack<00:04:49.670> I<00:04:50.090> mean<00:04:50.480> if

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
fat goes it gains 800 attack I mean if

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.480 
fat goes it gains 800 attack I mean if
you<00:04:50.960> have<00:04:51.200> like<00:04:51.440> 30<00:04:51.740> cards<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.220> your<00:04:52.310> hand

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
you have like 30 cards in your hand

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.460 
you have like 30 cards in your hand
which<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.480> can't<00:04:53.690> actually<00:04:53.870> do<00:04:54.140> in<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.320> deck

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
which you can't actually do in the deck

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.280 
which you can't actually do in the deck
that<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:55.070> showed<00:04:55.730> off<00:04:55.880> how<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.390> actually<00:04:56.870> you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
that I showed off how to actually you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.290 
that I showed off how to actually you
know<00:04:57.320> use<00:04:57.740> this<00:04:58.220> card<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.850> pull<00:04:59.030> off<00:04:59.120> some

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
know use this card and pull off some

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.940 
know use this card and pull off some
crazy<00:04:59.510> Oh<00:04:59.630> decays<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.470> thing<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.680> if<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:00.920> have

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
crazy Oh decays the thing is if you have

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.800 
crazy Oh decays the thing is if you have
like<00:05:01.220> 10<00:05:01.460> cards<00:05:01.760> in<00:05:01.850> your<00:05:01.910> hand<00:05:02.090> at<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.600> point

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
like 10 cards in your hand at that point

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.360 
like 10 cards in your hand at that point
you<00:05:03.080> should<00:05:03.470> be<00:05:03.770> able<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:03.950> make<00:05:04.010> a<00:05:04.070> play<00:05:04.340> I

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
you should be able to make a play I

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.650 
you should be able to make a play I
don't<00:05:04.610> know<00:05:04.760> what<00:05:04.910> deck<00:05:05.090> you're<00:05:05.240> playing<00:05:05.510> that

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
don't know what deck you're playing that

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.910 
don't know what deck you're playing that
just<00:05:05.840> draws<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.080> bunch<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.410> cards<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.830> then

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
just draws a bunch of cards and then

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.340 
just draws a bunch of cards and then
can't<00:05:07.220> use<00:05:07.520> them<00:05:07.790> but<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.300> know<00:05:08.420> for<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.320> most

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
can't use them but you know for the most

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.110 
can't use them but you know for the most
part<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.830> think<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.100> secondary<00:05:10.670> effect<00:05:11.000> is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
part I think the secondary effect is

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.240 
part I think the secondary effect is
just<00:05:11.510> really<00:05:11.960> really<00:05:12.140> good<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.650> mean<00:05:12.980> at<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
just really really good I mean at the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
just really really good I mean at the
moment<00:05:13.520> what<00:05:13.700> good<00:05:13.940> level<00:05:14.660> tens<00:05:14.900> are<00:05:15.140> there<00:05:15.320> in

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
moment what good level tens are there in

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.530 
moment what good level tens are there in
the<00:05:15.440> game<00:05:15.560> other<00:05:15.830> than<00:05:16.070> like<00:05:16.250> maybe<00:05:16.460> Leo<00:05:16.760> um<00:05:17.030> I

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
the game other than like maybe Leo um I

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.790 
the game other than like maybe Leo um I
think<00:05:17.570> that's<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> most<00:05:18.020> meta<00:05:18.290> one<00:05:18.500> right<00:05:18.680> now

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
think that's the most meta one right now

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.590 
think that's the most meta one right now
in<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.130> game<00:05:19.280> but<00:05:19.430> unless<00:05:19.760> it's<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.360> pretty

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
in the game but unless it's a pretty

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.500 
in the game but unless it's a pretty
cool<00:05:20.900> ycs<00:05:21.500> or<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.770> prize<00:05:22.130> card<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.580> general<00:05:22.910> just

cool ycs or a prize card in general just
because<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.720> lot<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:23.900> these<00:05:24.020> prize<00:05:24.320> cards<00:05:24.650> to

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.880 
think it's cool that you get to see some
of<00:06:35.030> these<00:06:35.120> cards<00:06:35.420> in<00:06:35.690> play<00:06:35.720> that<00:06:36.440> are<00:06:36.590> pretty

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
of these cards in play that are pretty

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.770 
of these cards in play that are pretty
good<00:06:37.220> but<00:06:37.580> in<00:06:37.670> the<00:06:38.060> sense<00:06:38.240> it's<00:06:38.390> not<00:06:38.510> like<00:06:38.660> you

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
good but in the sense it's not like you

good but in the sense it's not like you
have<00:06:39.050> to<00:06:39.080> be<00:06:39.350> playing<00:06:39.590> that<00:06:39.770> card<00:06:39.920> if<00:06:40.160> you<00:06:40.190> want
