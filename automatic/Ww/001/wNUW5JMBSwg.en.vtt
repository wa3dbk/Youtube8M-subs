00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 sometimes 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.219
 and now let's do the calibration of 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.529
 the leading edge of the machine when 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.260
 we need to do this task when 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.680
 he hears a thumping inside the machine 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.810
 produced by the rocker against 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.910
 valve where the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.840
 of our machine in the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.300
 sides of the engine we have on this side 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.850
 aim 1 and 2 to calibrate the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.059
 we need to lift the car from this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.630
 part when calibrating the monterías 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 from side 3 4 it is necessary to raise the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.510
 car of this part 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 to facilitate this task we are going to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 do it in a disassembled engine 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.149
 very well now let's calibrate or 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.100
 adjust the monterías of our machine 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.770
 for this first we need 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.750
 identify the marks on the pulley of the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.050
 crankshaft we have two brands 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.480
 we have one on the left side of the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.360
 pulley and I is on the right side 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.910
 the biggest one helps us to know the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.590
 Top dead center and the little extra 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.390
 the right side is to put the time 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.050
 the engine is a 7 degree mark and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.090
 months in this case we occupy the brand of 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.740
 top dead center which is the most 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 big and we put it 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 the union of the two parts of the blog that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.680
 is perfectly aligned there we have 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.190
 already our crankshaft mark we proceed 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.320
 now to remove the distributor cap 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.110
 to make sure that our brush 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.229
 is indicating the spark plug wire 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.630
 number 1 the number 1 is this one that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.509
 let's calibrate first very well now 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.380
 remove the staple with the screwdriver 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.380
 hold the lid 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.490
 and with a 15-millimeter wrench or 13 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.140
 according to the case since these nuts 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 come the two measures depending on the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.210
 engine 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.210
 let's loosen the 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:19.359
 we introduce our line of 6 thousandths 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.359
 inch or 15 millimeter point 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.750
 with the screwdriver 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.650
 we adjust the way you can move 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.650
 slightly 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.820
 with the same screwdriver we stop and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.820
 we press with the key 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.770
 we squeeze hard and make sure 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.210
 that is perfectly that does not have 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.300
 a lot of game and that of just the line to not 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.270
 stop anything game we repeat the same 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 operation 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.830
 with the next aim or adjuster 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.830
 we squeeze 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:08.920
 we are the nut and we squeeze it with the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.770
 key again we check the attention 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.400
 and so we have calibrated the aim 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.400
 number 1 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.580
 very good now to continue with the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.630
 cylinder aim calibration 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.239
 number 2 we need this brand 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.160
 is exactly 180 degrees or half 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.520
 turn to the left 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.140
 to get the brush to point us 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.620
 to cylinder number 2 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.760
 parakeet with the help of the city do 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.080
 remember that the return is to the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.610
 left 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.569
 in the opposite direction of the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.980
 clock hands 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.500
 we put it more or less 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.760
 to the same union of the monoblock 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.650
 and points us to the brush 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.989
 at number 2 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.019
 very well we calibrate the cylinder 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.450
 number 2 with the previous procedure 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.230
 now let's give way to calibration 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 or cylinder setting number 3 for that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.780
 we have to turn again towards 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.030
 Left remember that it is important 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.060
 crankshaft pulley to make it appear 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.920
 again the brand that tells us the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.280
 top dead center which is the brand 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.160
 which must be aligned between 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.500
 the two unions of the blog the brush 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.830
 points us now 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.930
 towards the spark plug on floor number 3 and 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.340
 we calibrate the number 2 that is 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.730
 in the back 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 have done the calibration 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.950
 we proceed to piston number 4 again 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.650
 we turn to the left 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.160
 another half-turn our policy of 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.160
 crankshaft 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.880
 we selected that the brush 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.320
 points to the spark plug wire number 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.780
 4 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.420
 and here we release the spark plug number 4 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.389
 very well once the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.730
 procedure to calibrate the aim 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.120
 we proceed to place the lid and review 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.340
 board 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.560
 do the stage of the monterías in the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.720
 which presents a board that is a 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.300
 packing to prevent leakage if it 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.190
 Find damaged is recommended 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.199
 change it to a new one by applying a 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.960
 little fat if it is in good 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.639
 the state can keep let 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.639
 proceed to place it in its place 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.190
 we select who agrees 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.380
 perfectly in the head 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.500
 we lift the staple and with the help of a 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.590
 screwdriver we press until we hung the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.800
 clip and we apply a couple of strokes with 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.040
 this we finalized the entire process 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.040
 calibration
