and that's really unfortunate but that's

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.170 
and that's really unfortunate but that's
just<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.650> way<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.580> in<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.940> scenario

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

gameplay I went full out objective like

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.969 
gameplay I went full out objective like
you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.289> getting<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> lot<00:01:19.649> of<00:01:19.710> kills

too<00:01:20.249> and<00:01:20.579> you<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:20.999> that's<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.509> about

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
too and you know that's really it about

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.760 
too and you know that's really it about
the<00:01:21.810> gameplay<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> thought<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.469> was<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> pretty

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the gameplay I thought it was a pretty

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
the gameplay I thought it was a pretty
solid<00:01:23.069> and<00:01:23.340> unique<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.509> not

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
solid and unique one because it's not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
solid and unique one because it's not
one<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.079> my<00:01:25.229> typical<00:01:25.530> gameplays<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.639> it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.819> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
one of my typical gameplays but it is a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
one of my typical gameplays but it is a
97<00:01:27.600> kill<00:01:27.780> gameplay<00:01:28.200> against<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> clan<00:01:28.889> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
97 kill gameplay against the clan and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.309 
97 kill gameplay against the clan and
they<00:01:29.249> are<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.819> theory<00:01:30.179> actually<00:01:30.719> stronger

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
they are in theory actually stronger

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.649 
they are in theory actually stronger
than<00:01:31.469> your<00:01:31.619> own<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.920> pubstomp<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.659> stronger

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
than your own will pubstomp or stronger

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.599 
than your own will pubstomp or stronger
than<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:33.959> average<00:01:34.109> casual<00:01:34.979> player<00:01:35.249> I<00:01:35.280> should

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
than your average casual player I should

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.760 
than your average casual player I should
say<00:01:35.819> so<00:01:35.880> hopefully<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.079> guys<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.259> enjoy<00:01:37.469> the

matchmaking<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.749> Reverse<00:01:46.109> boosting<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:47.429> think

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
matchmaking in Reverse boosting I think

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
matchmaking in Reverse boosting I think
reverse<00:01:48.119> boosting<00:01:48.539> is<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.079> ridiculous<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
reverse boosting is just ridiculous I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.559 
reverse boosting is just ridiculous I
mean<00:01:50.069> I've<00:01:50.159> said<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.359> they

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
mean I've said this a lot but they

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.269 
mean I've said this a lot but they
should<00:01:51.749> match<00:01:51.899> people<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.439> first<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
should match people up first and

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.870 
should match people up first and
foremost<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:54.779> care<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
foremost I don't care what kind of

like<00:01:58.469> Jesus<00:01:58.920> Christ<00:01:58.979> himself<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.909> enjoy<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
like Jesus Christ himself I enjoy a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.849

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
challenge every now and then but I

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.260 
challenge every now and then but I
really<00:02:02.279> just<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.639> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.880> matched<00:02:03.060> up

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really just don't want to be matched up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.239 
really just don't want to be matched up
with<00:02:03.329> players<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.319> are<00:02:04.469> absolutely

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
with players that are absolutely

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.679 
with players that are absolutely
horrible<00:02:05.639> it<00:02:05.789> doesn't<00:02:06.060> help<00:02:06.209> me

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
horrible it doesn't help me

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
horrible it doesn't help me
it<00:02:06.990> doesn't<00:02:07.289> help<00:02:07.409> them<00:02:07.709> because<00:02:07.979> they're

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it doesn't help them because they're

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
it doesn't help them because they're
just<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> sell<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.880> game<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.209> whatever

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just going to sell the game or whatever

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.850 
just going to sell the game or whatever
and<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> no<00:02:09.959> fun<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.170> anybody<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and that's just no fun for anybody and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.920 
and that's just no fun for anybody and
if<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.880> take<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> out<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.420> advanced

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
if they don't take it out of advanced

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.809 
if they don't take it out of advanced
warfare<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.650> don't<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> why<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.430> put<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.640> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
warfare I don't see why they put it in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.250 
warfare I don't see why they put it in
the<00:02:15.030> first<00:02:15.239> place<00:02:15.420> because<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.930> failed

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the first place because it failed

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
the first place because it failed
massively<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.370> black<00:02:17.579> ops<00:02:17.819> 2<00:02:17.909> and<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:18.239> pretty

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
massively in black ops 2 and I'm pretty

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.720 
massively in black ops 2 and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:18.629> Treyarch<00:02:19.230> actually<00:02:20.069> two<00:02:20.220> stomachs

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
sure Treyarch actually two stomachs

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.180 
sure Treyarch actually two stomachs
took<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.330> even<00:02:21.690> slightly<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> game<00:02:23.069> I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
took it even slightly out of the game I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
took it even slightly out of the game I
know<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.900> know<00:02:25.019> they

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
know not all the way but I know they

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290 
know not all the way but I know they
took<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.739> partially<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.730> that'll<00:02:27.209> be

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
took it out partially and that'll be

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.880 
took it out partially and that'll be
great<00:02:27.629> advanced<00:02:27.989> warfare<00:02:28.410> could<00:02:28.530> even<00:02:28.680> take

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
great advanced warfare could even take

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.080 
great advanced warfare could even take
it<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.400> bit<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:29.940> now

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it out a little bit because right now

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.360 
it out a little bit because right now
it's<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.300> way<00:02:30.629> too<00:02:30.660> much<00:02:31.050> over<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.440> edge<00:02:31.560> but

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
it's just way too much over the edge but

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's just way too much over the edge but
um<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.870> really<00:02:33.870> hope<00:02:34.170> Treyarch<00:02:34.739> learns<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
um I really hope Treyarch learns a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.850 
um I really hope Treyarch learns a
lesson<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.330> does<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:37.019> put<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> into<00:02:37.769> their

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
lesson and does not put it into their

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.440 
lesson and does not put it into their
next<00:02:38.160> Call<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> Duty<00:02:38.489> game<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.269> be<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
next Call of Duty game that would be a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.290 
next Call of Duty game that would be a
killer<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.640> no<00:02:41.819> fun<00:02:42.090> because

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
killer it's just it's no fun because

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.140 
killer it's just it's no fun because
