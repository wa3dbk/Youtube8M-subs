00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
vertices right here bring those down

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.599 
vertices right here bring those down
grab<00:00:16.920> these<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.400> bring<00:00:17.760> them<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:19.340> grab<00:00:20.340> these

don't want to take up you know too much
time<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> tutorial<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:56.149> just<00:00:57.149> bring

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.660 

and<00:01:01.600> since<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:02.780> did<00:01:02.990> that<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.830> actually<00:01:04.190> like

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
and since we did that I actually like

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.940 
and since we did that I actually like
the<00:01:04.910> way<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.390> curve<00:01:05.750> is<00:01:05.960> going<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.860> I'm

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
the way that that curve is going so I'm

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.170 
the way that that curve is going so I'm
going<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.130> leave<00:01:07.250> mine<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:07.970> if<00:01:08.090> you

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
going to leave mine like that but if you

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.150 
going to leave mine like that but if you
guys<00:01:08.330> don't<00:01:08.540> like<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.230> can<00:01:09.290> just<00:01:09.440> grab<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
guys don't like it you can just grab and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.360 
guys don't like it you can just grab and
then<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.550> know<00:01:10.700> take<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.370> so

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
then you know take it in like that so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.790 
then you know take it in like that so
that<00:01:13.520> it's<00:01:13.700> not<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.480> not<00:01:14.630> curving<00:01:15.110> like<00:01:15.470> mine

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
that it's not it's not curving like mine

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.890 
that it's not it's not curving like mine
is<00:01:16.900> so<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:22.580> know<00:01:22.730> what<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.030> top<00:01:23.390> row<00:01:23.660> right

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
is so you know what this top row right

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.570 
is so you know what this top row right
here<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:25.450> loops<00:01:26.450> all<00:01:27.440> right<00:01:27.980> click<00:01:28.280> on<00:01:28.430> that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
here and loops all right click on that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
here and loops all right click on that
top<00:01:28.880> row<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:32.360> line<00:01:32.780> right<00:01:33.140> here<00:01:34.600> because

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
top row and this line right here because

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.680 
top row and this line right here because
I<00:01:35.780> feel<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:37.119> these<00:01:38.410> should<00:01:39.410> actually<00:01:43.690> you

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
I feel that these should actually you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.899 
I feel that these should actually you
see<00:01:44.960> going<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:46.040> deselect<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.300> over<00:01:48.020> here

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
see going to deselect this over here

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.690 
see going to deselect this over here
it's<00:01:50.509> really<00:01:50.869> hard<00:01:51.200> once<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.829> get<00:01:52.189> in<00:01:52.340> here

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's really hard once you get in here

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.429 
it's really hard once you get in here
and<00:01:52.729> start<00:01:53.619> d<00:01:54.619> select<00:01:55.039> these<00:01:58.240> 27<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.840> go<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.079> top

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
and start d select these 27 to go to top

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.300 
and start d select these 27 to go to top
view<00:02:00.770> over<00:02:01.130> here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.400 

and<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.930> feel<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:06.920> should<00:02:06.950> actually

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and I feel that they should actually

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.680 
and I feel that they should actually
rotate<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> little<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:13.180> see<00:02:14.180> how<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.450> do

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
rotate a little bit see how I can do

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:28.860 
rotate a little bit see how I can do
this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:03:05.430 

ok

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.920 

we're<00:03:06.190> going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.460> rotate<00:03:06.820> them<00:03:07.240> on<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.630> z-axis

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
we're going to rotate them on the z-axis

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.050 
we're going to rotate them on the z-axis
that's<00:03:10.930> about<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.470> best<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.920> could<00:03:11.980> get<00:03:12.310> yeah

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
that's about the best I could get yeah

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.010 
that's about the best I could get yeah
really<00:03:13.600> like<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.320> right<00:03:14.530> there<00:03:14.590> looks<00:03:16.020> it's

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
really like that right there looks it's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.420 
really like that right there looks it's
pretty<00:03:17.260> good<00:03:19.110> can't<00:03:20.110> go<00:03:20.260> out<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.530> edit<00:03:20.800> mode<00:03:21.100> um

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
pretty good can't go out of edit mode um

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.640 
pretty good can't go out of edit mode um
check<00:03:22.060> out<00:03:22.210> your<00:03:22.420> wings<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.870> got<00:03:23.020> here<00:03:23.350> if<00:03:23.530> you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
check out your wings you got here if you

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.920 
check out your wings you got here if you
don't<00:03:23.800> like<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.250> I'm<00:03:24.430> go<00:03:25.060> back<00:03:25.240> in<00:03:25.480> mess<00:03:25.720> with

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
don't like it I'm go back in mess with

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.800 
don't like it I'm go back in mess with
the<00:03:26.020> vertices<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.920> bit<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.570> think<00:03:28.570> that

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the vertices a little bit I think that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:44.600 
the vertices a little bit I think that
this<00:03:28.990> should

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.180 

alright<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.900> right<00:03:46.110> there<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:47.070> know

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
alright I like that right there you know

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.890 
alright I like that right there you know
just<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.730> go<00:03:47.880> back<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.270> mess<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.720> your

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
just just go back in mess with your

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.390 
just just go back in mess with your
vertices<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:51.140> see<00:03:52.140> if<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.410> can<00:03:52.770> touch<00:03:53.220> them

on<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.660> videos<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.200> read<00:04:58.380> all<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.590> those<00:04:58.860> once

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
on the videos I read all of those once

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.219 
on the videos I read all of those once
they<00:04:59.370> go<00:04:59.580> up<00:04:59.760> when<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.540> get<00:05:00.690> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> computer

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
they go up when I get on the computer

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.969 
they go up when I get on the computer
and<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:02.520> answer<00:05:02.850> questions<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.510> there<00:05:03.750> as<00:05:03.900> well

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
and I answer questions on there as well

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.850 
and I answer questions on there as well
so<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.600> guess<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.870> till<00:05:07.080> next<00:05:07.320> time<00:05:07.380> just<00:05:07.530> have

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.070
