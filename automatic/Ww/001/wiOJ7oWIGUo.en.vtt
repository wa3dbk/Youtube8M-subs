00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.800
 I have his songs now 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.750
 have a little rest and have some people 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.419
 I asked if I turn video again 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.070
 That's why they can be old-fashioned 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.599
 I know that 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.219
 it's a big secret or why 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.280
 there hardly any videos try as possible 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.620
 I would also like to explain again 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.430
 if people stop constructive contributions 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.860
 bring 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.600
 You are welcome to leave out the negative ones 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.890
 someone to their own video it better 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.680
 I try makes it so I can 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.379
 me about this old story 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.399
 I have to teach myself 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.120
 masterfully follow bought the ugly 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.789
 4 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.739
 the cost I do not know what 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.230
 now it costs half a year 34 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.719
 Just tasted the years before 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.609
 advantage that you speak to the a 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.760
 you can learn the calculator correctly 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.499
 connect remote control and the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.239
 Material wear it does not hold so high 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.989
 because then, for example, two of this 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.569
 helicopter dx from blade of the stop and 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.440
 there comes a bit of the mass 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:07.670
 behind and he then breaks up 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.469
 what an uncomfortable if you then 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.159
 that has africa on it 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.630
 every case 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.159
 I do not have it and that's why I am 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.960
 this program bought in surprise 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.549
 and in the end I have it with me 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.119
 I do not know how many probably 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.530
 1000 euro saved because I have that 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.740
 stop in practice then stop 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.600
 have made but just computer 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.759
 so to speak, the helicopter cent not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 So that's how we're with now 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.829
 at times 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.570
 So that would be the so to speak 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.490
 normal position how to get hold off 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.810
 would 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.390
 Of course it always depends on it now 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.060
 like me now as awesome as I am now 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 Remote control has programmed so there 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.229
 yes there are different attitude 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.570
 if you fly in normal mode right now 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.850
 how to stop again until it starts 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.299
 so that if you are this hard 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.740
 upwards, catching leaves or leaves 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.960
 then advise of a negative 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.710
 attitude to the neutral position now 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.789
 for example, in this middle position 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.460
 and the further I go up 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.590
 the more positive attitude go 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.180
 I then scroll down and also 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.060
 at the same time the speed of the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.860
 motors and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
 the further the sector goes up 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.110
 so now because of this old story 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 this is the chorus too 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.380
 no matter 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.590
 I would now purely theoretical in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.140
 I would be with that position 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.420
 helicopter floating in the air 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.640
 what I do now is I would this 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.630
 beat 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.680
 provided of course you have that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.170
 Helicopter under control and is not 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.819
 too windy so at least a start if 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.739
 you stop that does not matter 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.780
 you can still fly in the wind 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.640
 something like that actually happened now 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.130
 if you assume it is correct 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.410
 programmed here would be the engine 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.260
 so to speak, to 100 percent go to the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
 means he is running for joy 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.220
 no matter if I go down now or 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.049
 after somehow the engine runs on 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.220
 100 percent 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.140
 and that's sort of the trick to the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.760
 whole thing the only thing I have here 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.410
 now, so to speak, is changing this movement 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.790
 that is still in the background that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.420
 the rotor blades of the fish, so to speak 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.980
 it changes and it would be 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.510
 just like that is before the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.140
 helicopter would have stood 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.260
 so to speak, the tale adapts to me 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 So last time I'll do it that way 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.359
 I would have in holders before me 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.810
 then hovering as a beginner at 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.180
 the easiest would be the position 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.430
 yes, so would screw , so to speak 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 turn back to me when 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.019
 there would be the nose up, so to speak 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.319
 I would come then 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.810
 start and put this here in the negative 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.049
 stop holding down the engine 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.670
 runs at 100% which is now, so to speak 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.380
 I will now both of them 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.870
 it would be like that now 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.200
 helicopter get together with this 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.000
 and he would then increase 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.889
 then was once again on to tell me 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780
 50 percent would bring and would over head 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.859
 you have to hover your neck so to speak 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.450
 yes correct 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.720
 which is of course how much it 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.100
 wind is or how much and not 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.660
 everything about us puts us exactly that 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.889
 same as when I make it up 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.780
 and I have to fly over head then 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.230
 he would stop 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.210
 well and as I said around the country 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.470
 then you would stop again 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.630
 again, so to speak 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.770
 Let me just go this way 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.810
 put it back in the back 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.460
 helicopter turns again and in 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.020
 the normal position is that he will go then 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.060
 just turn around again and like now 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.230
 is held in the air are then 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.410
 could you make that out again and 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.880
 could back to normal fever that was 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.440
 It's one of the theory maybe 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.060
 I should go out before winter 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.139
 would be something practical 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.139
 thank you first
