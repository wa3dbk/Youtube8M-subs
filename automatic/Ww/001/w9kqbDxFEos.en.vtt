00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
say that but I do find that a huge

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.710 
say that but I do find that a huge
problem<00:03:31.699> on<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:31.849> own<00:03:32.120> because<00:03:32.329> when<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:32.689> have

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
problem on my own because when you have

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.999 
problem on my own because when you have
sometimes<00:03:33.139> you<00:03:33.199> have<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.379> change<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.650> item

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:34.009 
sometimes you have to change the item

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.110 
sometimes you have to change the item
ids<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.669> in<00:03:35.479> doing<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> you'd<00:03:36.759> destroy<00:03:37.759> some

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
ids and in doing that you'd destroy some

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.670 
ids and in doing that you'd destroy some
like<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.449> think<00:03:38.689> like<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.019> when<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.290> map

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
like to think like that when the map

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.259 
like to think like that when the map
loads<00:03:39.949> it<00:03:40.129> doesn't<00:03:40.370> go<00:03:40.459> off<00:03:40.579> names<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.150> goes

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
loads it doesn't go off names it goes

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.050 
loads it doesn't go off names it goes
off<00:03:41.419> IDs<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.379> when<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.829> ID<00:03:43.009> changes<00:03:43.669> it<00:03:43.879> just

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
off IDs and when the ID changes it just

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.869 
off IDs and when the ID changes it just
completely<00:03:44.389> destroys<00:03:44.930> your<00:03:45.169> map<00:03:45.409> and<00:03:45.879> you

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
completely destroys your map and you

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.789 
completely destroys your map and you
can't<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.509> can't<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.109> i<00:03:48.169> mean<00:03:48.379> i

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799
