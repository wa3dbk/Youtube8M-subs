up break them down and throw them inside
the<00:01:35.190> compactor<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.300> not<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.660> cause<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.320> block

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
machine from compacting when that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
machine from compacting when that
happens<00:01:43.080> then<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.800> trash<00:01:44.040> starts<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
come out here and it becomes a mess and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.890 
come out here and it becomes a mess and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
just let go close and the machine won't

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.250 
just let go close and the machine won't
start<00:02:00.470> compacting<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.460> its<00:02:01.640> own<00:02:02.110> once<00:02:03.110> it
