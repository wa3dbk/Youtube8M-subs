we're going to start with the journal of
two<00:01:11.420> sisters<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.530> said<00:01:12.590> with<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
two sisters so like I said with the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.710 
two sisters so like I said with the
artwork<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.090> way<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.420> book<00:01:14.540> is

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
artwork and just the way the book is

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.450 
artwork and just the way the book is
represented<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.560> very<00:01:15.890> similar<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
represented it's very similar to the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.430 
represented it's very similar to the
elements<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.850> harmony<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.330> however<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:18.320> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
elements of harmony but however it's a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.930 
elements of harmony but however it's a
fraction<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.010> size<00:01:19.159> it's<00:01:19.370> actually<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> lot

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
fraction of the size it's actually a lot

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.980 
fraction of the size it's actually a lot
smaller<00:01:20.299> than<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.600> elements<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:20.930> harmony

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
smaller than the elements of harmony

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.440 
smaller than the elements of harmony
because<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.979> true<00:01:22.759> book<00:01:23.180> it's

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
because this is a true book it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.330 
because this is a true book it's
actually<00:01:23.780> got<00:01:23.930> chapters<00:01:24.619> essentially<00:01:25.189> and

anyone who watches the show knows the

only<00:04:14.170> complaint<00:04:14.770> would<00:04:14.890> have<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.280> that

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
only complaint would have is that

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.060 
only complaint would have is that
because<00:04:15.760> it's<00:04:16.330> 40<00:04:16.870> posters<00:04:17.410> which<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.770> a<00:04:17.799> lot

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
because it's 40 posters which is a lot

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.039 
because it's 40 posters which is a lot
but<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> biggest<00:04:18.609> problem<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.720> have<00:04:19.900> to

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
but the biggest problem is you have to

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.630 
but the biggest problem is you have to
be<00:04:20.169> very<00:04:20.200> choosy<00:04:20.830> if<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.070> want<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.400> remove

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
be very choosy if you want to remove

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.830 
be very choosy if you want to remove
these<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.060> put<00:04:22.090> them<00:04:22.270> up<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.600> your<00:04:22.720> wall

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
these and put them up on your wall

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.320 
these and put them up on your wall
because<00:04:23.169> they<00:04:23.710> are<00:04:23.890> double-sided<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.850> instead

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
because they are double-sided so instead

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.620 
because they are double-sided so instead
of<00:04:25.390> having<00:04:25.660> separate<00:04:26.320> pages<00:04:26.680> its<00:04:27.270> poster<00:04:28.270> side

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
of having separate pages its poster side

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.270 
of having separate pages its poster side
