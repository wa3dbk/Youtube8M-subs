00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.220
 This Hello days pond 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:12.080
 Today is also the end of the year 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.350
 I would like to talk about windows 8 or macbook pro 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.350
 I will 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:25.150
 or a not that many want to enter the world do not you this in quite a lot of people in the country that is suffering 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:31.810
 I think so 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:34.840
 I'm also seriously worried about what I can buy for Christmas 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.040
 But in I'm using now windows 7 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.940
 The so we pretty backlash is coming 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.510
 Just a personal computer for your company 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 I think I would like to carry or use snacks next time 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.320
 It is Truly dance to refer to the touch panel to be announced during this time windows 8 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.650
 Ne 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 I thought it would be better to buy a fast-paced India weight 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.040
 It is and that Cub's during this time youtube partner fellow 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.440
 I did a training shot with Gina together 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:19.070
 I think I'm a bring the air of the Tokima mac 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 Bring in the air and let me show you all sorts of software, and this is better with Mac too 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.909
 Nato 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.810
 Have a hair? 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.979
 I'm going to go back to book pro now-this time out 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.979
 windows 8 is softening 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.320
 So much recently 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.950
 Nde have heard say well no 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.600
 Let's make it a macbook pro completely 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.140
 I think the Fu say 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:53.360
 After all various sound propaganda 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:56.860
 I think that there are effects of advertising, but people who are very good at people who are close 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.330
 I think I'm not good at using windows 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.710
 I think it is not expressive 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.159
 If I use windows, I already feel like I'm going to be a fossil 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.910
 I just started out recently 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.170
 If you use an apple 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 I can say that I can do creative things 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.740
 It becomes such an image now 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.900
 Anything completely macbook pro 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.140
 I think I will buy it 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.710
 How are you guys Christmas 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.319
 Which one is better 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.240
 I have a good Mac mac 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.100
 Well, until now 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.250
 i didn't have iphone life 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.280
 Now my PC 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.959
 It has become a Mac 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.540
 Now to be able to be And editing and peony of great video it is not necessary to have a white board 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.220
 I think I guess 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.950
 This is actually that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.590
 It is on the screen of the video 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.470
 As we can not put out letter 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.300
 In the current situation 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.450
 I'm using windows 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.260
 With mac 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.440
 It's soft on the back and it's such a great soft on windows 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 I can use it, but I 'm thinking of trying to make it a fuck 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:21.920
 I think that a great tool from Dub will be sleeping from next year on Mac's list 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:27.990
 Let's also buy Macs by all means it should be creative 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.680
 Though I'm a postscript of Thank was wearing now moving thank you is more than 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.770
 Speaking of mac 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.750
 I have been a salesperson in the IT industry before 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.420

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.330

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.340
 It's heavy had been Neme wearing Center screen you do not know well you're using 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.349
 Oh dear 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.349
 I do not know whether it is good or not 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.620
 If Ya will be buying back 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.310
 Because I did not think 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.490
 Maybe I too 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.750
 It 's now possible to put out a mask that you don't understand why 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.920
 Naa might make a good thing, such as unaccountable 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.990
 We are or think 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.509
 windows 8 may be good too 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:33.400
 Apart from I not think that I want to ask to show someone I is If anyone is buying a little 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.139
 I do not dislike windows but 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.139
 For work 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:44.520
 Well, when the work department does not work Kurete without a Mac 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.180
 I do maybe you buy 2 units in windows when you office work a normal work 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.750
 It might be 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.560
 Hmm 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.280
 If it's the previous video, I'm stuck pushing the mac 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.740
 It also windows 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:01.030
 With two curtain of windows with everyone two Nde I think good depending on how 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.750
