into<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> starting<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> gear<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.789> off

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
into it starting with the gear first off

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
into it starting with the gear first off
the<00:00:24.090> gladiator<00:00:24.660> gear<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.260> its<00:00:25.439> real<00:00:25.769> skin

the gladiator gear now has its real skin
and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> looks<00:00:27.029> pretty<00:00:27.269> awesome

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and I think that it looks pretty awesome

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
and I think that it looks pretty awesome
at<00:00:27.869> least<00:00:28.019> considering<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
at least considering and that this is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.189 
at least considering and that this is
the<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.609> pvp<00:00:29.880> set<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> warlords<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
now moving on to these set bonuses you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
now moving on to these set bonuses you
can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> our<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.239> set<00:00:42.480> bonus<00:00:42.809> still

example but it is a pretty big book and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
example but it is a pretty big book and
when<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> surprised<00:01:20.850> havoc<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
when I was kind of surprised havoc in in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
when I was kind of surprised havoc in in
the<00:01:21.570> form<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.020> set<00:01:22.259> once<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.920> next<00:01:23.159> change

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the form of a set once the next change

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
the form of a set once the next change
which<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> slight<00:01:24.090> near<00:01:24.450> Phi<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
which is a slight near Phi think is to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
which is a slight near Phi think is to

so<00:02:11.810> what<00:02:11.960> are<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.170> changes<00:02:12.320> short<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.010> sweet

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
so what are the changes short and sweet

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.560 
so what are the changes short and sweet
and<00:02:13.400> they<00:02:13.490> have<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> say<00:02:13.970> I'm<00:02:14.300> actually

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
changes to come rolling in the cips that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.960 
changes to come rolling in the cips that
we<00:02:21.080> at<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:21.530> I'm<00:02:22.160> feeling<00:02:22.400> pretty<00:02:22.700> good

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
we at right now I'm feeling pretty good

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.030 
we at right now I'm feeling pretty good
about<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.300> world<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:24.170> with<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.650> said<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
about this world but with that said I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550 
about this world but with that said I
will<00:02:25.340> say<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> overall<00:02:26.300> feel<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.720> pvb

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
will say that the overall feel of pvb

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.320 
will say that the overall feel of pvb
isn't<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.310> great<00:02:28.550> at<00:02:28.820> least<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.090> my<00:02:29.210> opinion

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
isn't so great at least in my opinion

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.050 
isn't so great at least in my opinion
and<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.470> mean<00:02:30.680> by<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.460> pace<00:02:31.730> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
and what I mean by that is the pace of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.400 
and what I mean by that is the pace of
things<00:02:32.240> i<00:02:32.570> guess<00:02:32.780> i've<00:02:33.020> actually<00:02:33.230> been

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
things i guess i've actually been

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.170 
things i guess i've actually been
waiting<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> past<00:02:34.370> month<00:02:34.610> or<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:34.880> for

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
waiting for the past month or so for

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
waiting for the past month or so for
destructions<00:02:35.630> back<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.930> get<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.230> damage<00:02:36.680> both

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060

about Blizzard wanting to slow things
down<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.780> PvP<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.260> I'm<00:03:21.470> sure<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.920> is

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
down in PvP and I'm sure that that is

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.190 
down in PvP and I'm sure that that is
what<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.310> aiming<00:03:22.580> for<00:03:22.970> in-wall<00:03:23.360> odds<00:03:23.570> but<00:03:24.050> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
what they aiming for in-wall odds but it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.020 
what they aiming for in-wall odds but it
is<00:03:24.320> weird<00:03:24.770> too<00:03:25.040> much<00:03:25.250> at<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.460> moment<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
is weird too much at the moment so I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.430 
is weird too much at the moment so I
thought<00:03:26.180> I'd<00:03:26.330> just<00:03:26.450> voice<00:03:26.750> those<00:03:26.990> concerns

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
thought I'd just voice those concerns

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720 
thought I'd just voice those concerns
I'm<00:03:27.650> sure<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.920> thing's<00:03:28.100> gonna<00:03:28.220> get<00:03:28.460> a<00:03:28.490> little

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
I'm sure that thing's gonna get a little

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.100 
I'm sure that thing's gonna get a little
bit<00:03:28.880> better<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.720> guess<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.960> was<00:03:30.050> just

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
bit better I but I guess I was just

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.020 
bit better I but I guess I was just
hoping<00:03:30.260> for<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.740> lot<00:03:31.130> more<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.520> health<00:03:31.790> cool

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
hoping for a lot more of a health cool

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.910 
hoping for a lot more of a health cool
squish<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.510> think<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.780> wasn't<00:03:33.020> alone<00:03:33.290> when<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.770> was

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
squish I think I wasn't alone when I was

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.410 
squish I think I wasn't alone when I was
expecting<00:03:34.250> somewhere<00:03:34.670> around<00:03:34.820> wrath<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.390> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
expecting somewhere around wrath of the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.330 
expecting somewhere around wrath of the
lich<00:03:35.660> king<00:03:35.780> numbers<00:03:36.260> yeah<00:03:36.530> but<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.040> hasn't
