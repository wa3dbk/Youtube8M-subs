00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I now have the great happiness in 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.270
 kasteler was actually india 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 kind of a distance from that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 media world 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.509
 yes in any case so I'm in front 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 seven years because I was there 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.960
 after my job with sat 1 i have one 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.289
 daily live broadcast for sat 1 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.300
 moderated accordingly made me very 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 moved in a superficial world 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 Although boulevardmagazin and that has such a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.560
 bit of colliding with mine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.539
 At that time, he had been doing it for ten years 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 I have been doing yoga since then 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.380
 17 years in total and that has one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.469
 a little bit of coal so these 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 spiritual and profound and these 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.530
 superficial glittering world it was back then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 too much for me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 yes and you would believe it neudeutsch 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 I call burnout what then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.289
 i just was just 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.030
 depressed and somehow totally exhausted 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.129
 and said so you are running here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
 Something wrong and I'll take it now 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.210
 distance and have a first time out 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.829
 took 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.789
 if then because of yoga in india 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 landed and out of a year off 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.229
 have become seven which was very good 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 So did it my life 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.420
 really a very different and very much 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.520
 healthier and much nicer 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 direction I'm already 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 curious how does it look on such a day 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 it is somehow different if you are 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.400
 yoga is ok because so many madonna 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 for example the stands at 5 o'clock 30 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.710
 and she says that makes her first 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.240
 should be great as that looks for the yahoo 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 the way I actually have two 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 So if I am filming then live 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.689
 I have to get up at 5 o'clock anyway because 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 I have to sit in the mask at 6 o'clock 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.460
 and that's where I really practice 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.930
 a stripped-down yoga program so me 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.630
 have a program that the ten since 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.610
 years consistently through that is already 15 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.470
 minute program no matter where I am if it is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 in the plane in the hotel or elsewhere 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.530
 I pull that through that's just the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.479
 labor kerstin yes because there is such a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 a bit shorter the whole yoga program 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.240
 But I also go to axams regularly 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.979
 and take time out over the year and there 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.600
 then I only experienced yoga 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.119
 program so there I am in five 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.770
 then open in the morning but then one 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.350
 hour breathing exercises not hour 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.050
 meditation many many hours yoga office 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.810
 Mark and I share so on now so 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 Then I charge my jogi battery 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.380
 and of course when I'm filming 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.030
 then with my moderation stories 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.190
 sees the everyday to the Central differently 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.280
 but that's one hour 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.610
 Breath exercises one hour of meditation 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.590
 Charging batteries at 5 o'clock up 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.800
 the stupid life with me the blanket or 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 so i think i will be her 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.530
 somehow work but we have 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.460
 just talked about was when he 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.200
 also somehow different 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.150
 what's your philosophy behind it 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.590
 yes it is true you think so first over 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.000
 that sounds exhausting yes so close 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.910
 Write life of Kinzel to super 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.230
 but it is also a lot of discipline 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.450
 to get there very quickly in such 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.650
 a flea pure that means you come 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 sometime with four five hours sleep 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 out not bad at all or 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.160
 exhausting at five o'clock in the morning 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.440
 get up 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.440
 but you get more energy than you 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.750
 So give that works and yes 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
 I wish you my way of life 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.740
 I've been nourishing myself for a long time 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.900
 ten years vegetarian that is too 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.090
 even come through 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.560
 pay close attention to a healthy diet 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.510
 and many people always think that way 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.850
 good as boring and it is such a 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.620
 Ã–ko mÃ¸li do it but I believe I 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.340
 I'm the best example of that 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.260
 that too in modern fun western ones 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.180
 So lifestyle can integrate 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.770
 everyone who knows me knows I drink 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.380
 also like to have champagne or two or 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.060
 three yes and I like to run in times 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.070
 a designer dress over the red 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.660
 carpet 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.970
 but this includes spiritual and spiritual 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.960
 healthy life does not matter I would say 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 that I make up 70 percent of my life 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.190
 live really healthy and totally pay attention 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.070
 what I eat and drink and that 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.810
 the remaining 30% I treat myself with good 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.640
 At least it was me too 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.170
 Chocolate and I have one 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.870
 Pizza so I'm not so crazy 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.260
 militant cramped but it is in 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.690
 the very healthy balance and I feel 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.340
 I'm very good with this in your book 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.190
 you actually also diet tips or 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.250
 This book is all about Yoga 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.609
 yes I give some nutrition tips 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.510
 I had to be there with the publisher 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.520
 so 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.470
 but I'm actually negotiating partially 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.200
 wanted so many things in this book 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.940
 because yoga is not for me 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.140
 only what happens on the mat here 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.570
 in the west many think that 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.860
 Body exercises are yoga on the subject 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.990
 of course, there is still a lot of much left over 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.220
 There is more meditation than breathing and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.960
 Nutrition is also important 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.290
 cornerstone 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.390
 I have my three special pages for 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.790
 Topic nutrition durchgeboxt at the publishing house 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.070
 in fact we can do the subject 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.230
 Of course only scratching would be otherwise 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.910
 the book is a whole encyclopedia 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.450
 but not 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.550
 but I give the principles or the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.380
 basic tips what a logical diet 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.570
 The book also takes place in the book 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.030
 the book comes on the second of september 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.650
 I'm really looking forward to it and the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.650
 Many thanks to kerstin
