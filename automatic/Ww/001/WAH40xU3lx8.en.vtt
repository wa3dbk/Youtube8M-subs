00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 eintracht chefrainer roland seitz der 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.299
 sent his boys on friday evening 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.359
 on safari on the hunt and the goods 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.800
 successful 1 0 0 against the lions that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.449
 after all, only the second 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.830
 away defeat of the season for the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 guests from kassel 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 Of course, we interviewed him 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.900
 chief coach of the concord roland seitz 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 but also be yourself 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 opposite uwe wolf and the only one 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.870
 scorers of the lot 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 marco quotschalla to meet what the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.390
 had three to say look and listen 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 we just go in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.100
 have fun with me microphones allowed 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 I now welcome you visibly 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 pleased head coach eintracht roland 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.829
 seitz if you're a statistician and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 looked at this game in advance 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 then there was a team first 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 a single time this season away 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 lost to a team at home 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 not always acting like happy 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 Today you are happy that your team 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.220
 1 0 won very glad because the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 guys did a really great job 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 I think in advance we clarified that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 some players are not available today 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 have different reasons 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 suspended players injured players 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 important players and we have the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'm doing a great job 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 very happy at the hard fight 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 against a good team many 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.040
 ambition has and yes just beautiful here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 opposite uwe wolf has in the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 press conference just announced 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.610
 this victory was pretty happy though 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.540
 jakobus they vote him to now a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.280
 team and above all else 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 defend and of course have one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 Maybe so yes so statement 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.220
 that he too the team 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.210
 I think so that they can protect 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.340
 more than deserved 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.990
 because the chances were on relationships 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.880
 our side there was not much 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 because very intense game was midfield 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.509
 but chance was on our side 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.399
 We've done that for a long time 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.439
 nice train with the ahlener sg and 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.820
 The marco makes the thing in and it was 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.710
 but just like everybody said, everybody deserves it 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 has his opinion and that's why 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.180
 ok as well as much satisfaction for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.399
 you also in their tones 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 out when I see that the last one 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.270
 weeks are not necessarily the easiest 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 as a trainer of harmony trier was 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.569
 because it's easy for me 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.300
 What is covered here in your environment 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.590
 it happens that you are permanently negative here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.239
 mood brings in and it has 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.190
 Nobody deserves any topic 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.819
 teams work great 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.530
 together 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.030
 Of course we were partly not 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.769
 happy with certain games that he 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.660
 not a topic but if the results of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.890
 complete league look there is not 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.420
 so that we lose intention but 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.709
 also develop the other teams 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 Abstieges con six teams 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.290
 rising up 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.519
 place one and two entitled to the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.840
 you can climb as well as you can 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.310
 seven eight teams still place 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.049
 therefore it is for me 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 incomprehensible that the great 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.870
 mood has been made here and me 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'm just happy for the guys that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.319
 they continue to work well with us 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.900
 and that 's also the result 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.060
 implement punctually if we look 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.310
 look how it went after the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 13 0 defeat of concord against idar 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.870
 oberstein and then the last weeks 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.970
 straight as well as the favorites on the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.230
 they have lost the first places 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.239
 personally you have the last weeks 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.950
 experience that we have forgotten them 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.269
 that we also recently idar oberstein 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.069
 have won in morgans and if we have 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.660
 achieves what worms meanwhile for the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.060
 series plays they cut themselves out 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.650
 35 points now it was already 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.480
 a great achievement that was idar before 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.040
 oberstein that's why we last six 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.239
 play a game lost the game was 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.310
 not okay because you do not need it over there 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.900
 talk so I lay remain hot 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.639
 You can not lose the game but 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 the team believed in itself 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.250
 given gas and now have against 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.049
 absolute top team the ten 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.850
 brought points 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.850
 next week is on the program 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.549
 visit at Elversberg a very complete 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.109
 hot derby is then with how much 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.310
 now you are ready to take on the task 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.190
 next days in the preparation 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.500
 Enjoy this game at first 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.639
 we still have it for so long 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.389
 have played on the first wants 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.549
 I really should say that 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.290
 Saturday / Sunday enjoy this victory the 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.849

 On sunday you hope all that would be too 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.380
 a hot match for the tip of it 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.090
 I think I have more peace of mind there 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.230
 would prepare the team and we 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.489
 We want to get back to higher pressure 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.989
 will be at ebersberg 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.310
 you have a few problems now 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.540
 and we look forward to it, I think so 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.590
 is a nice game i hope that 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.630
 many fans come along 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.889
 who support us as well I hope 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.209
 thank you very much for the interview 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.290
 a nice earned quiet 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.640
 weekend 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.340
 I have my side now welcome the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.750
 guests coach uwe wolf r wolf they have in 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.090
 just a press conference 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.220
 happy victory for trier talked like 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.139
 they are unhappy with this 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.759
 defeat tonight that was already 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.880
 very unhappy if you ask the 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.930
 entire gameplay we do that 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.150
 compensation strike is denied 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.630
 then it was a tough situation 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 gabriel gallus at least something 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.740
 lazy if it leaves something within the 16er 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.139
 argue but at least had the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.850
 foul and i think throughout 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.460
 Gameplay will be here at least 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.250
 had earned a point and how 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.630
 It was a very intense game 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.320
 but we had just before the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.789
 half-time to more good opportunities 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 unfortunately we have no capital from it 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.169
 beaten and then, of course, was bitter 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.190
 for the team right in the 47 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.810
 minute the 0 1 from our view and from 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.430
 so of course that was later but the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.830
 team has everything until the end 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.080
 given and again with free kicks 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.580
 my chance sebastian schmeer pictures 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 From acute angle we shoot there 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.690
 maybe the ball has been better 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.000
 but still know where 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.680
 you stand the table is bigger than 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.099
 parades in the game against Kaiserslautern 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.199
 so everything is very close we have 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.690
 even less games and therefore look 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.610
 we are positive about it if we go now 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.430
 take a look at them personally 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.500
 Your team has this season on 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.250
 strangers race only once 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.560
 lost 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.030
 and if it was observed correctly then 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.500
 they had just been in the first time 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.180
 the game was set and at once 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.889
 she again like a hb male in the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.530
 air gives how does she have this part 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.689
 personally taken 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:49.320
 I lived on emotions and 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:52.140
 I'm not one of the 90 minutes down 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.940
 I can sit quietly on the sidelines 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.320
 expect my team to live and work 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.120
 I am actually experienced a coach 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.950
 is always with and is natural 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.890
 later, when zones become debris 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.660
 device must push the team number 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.280
 and there are simply part we can just 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.710
 a corresponding body language 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.200
 shows and that the boys also after the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.970
 error yes so one makes ball loss since 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.950
 no reproach , of course, later 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.250
 and victor is that even on 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.690
 he disappointed everyone but that means 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.550
 we win together loses together 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.010
 you have to raise the guys and that 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.450
 is just ok fact it wishes you 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.920
 Now a lot of success and first time 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.410
 I have nice weeks with me now 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.390
 Welcome the scorer the only one 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.520
 the lot marco "qualla 1 0 wins 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.370
 the harmony yes how satisfied are you 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.070
 are you happy that you are, so to speak 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.810
 play decisions today so I am 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.700
 had to be very happy about my goal 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.630
 also and only very much 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.240
 happier but that we are the three 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.830
 have left their points and yes me 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.540
 say so we think game by game 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.460
 and yes it can go on 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.010
 the last few weeks were with security 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.990
 not the simplest than the 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.880
 were a bit mixed like that 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.400
 It was hard for you personally 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.470
 to deal with them 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.430
 that means mixed so we say so 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.170
 Team does not have that 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.550
 let in what happens in the environment we 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.080
 As I said, we try to play 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.610
 to think and try each other's game 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.050
 play our performance 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.600
 yes and that succeeded today with the three 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.160
 score how hard this game was 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.020
 against the hessen one has sometimes the 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.150
 impression that's pretty rough 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.490
 and I fight to go to the square 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.020
 yes absolutely so they were very very 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.540
 robust the battles have the goods 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.430
 very strong, however, in the first half 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.770
 we have to say we have a bit 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.170
 offensive the punch was missing 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.640
 has little offensive action in the 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.400
 second half the system then at 10 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.750
 44 23 11 worked better for me, too 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.440
 viewed with the ones with the clear ones 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.290
 chances 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.880
 ok how many condition units 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.110
 Are you actually completing the week? 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.210
 we saw you sometimes 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.120
 to the own 16er sums up the balls 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.260
 get out ok as a condition 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.600
 units so I'm one anyway 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.250
 Player type that comes over the run 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.030
 the runner is very strong yes and 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.560
 no it is are believed to go 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.060

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.840

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.189
