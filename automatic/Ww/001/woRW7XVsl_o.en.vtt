it's a reverse flow style that means all
the<00:00:23.390> there's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> plate<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.779> goes<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
way across so all the heat and smoke

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.870 
way across so all the heat and smoke
goes<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.470> across<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.279> then<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.609> and

two sliding over it kind of a heat sink
barrier<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.610> hides<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.300> damper<00:00:51.690> controls

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
barrier it also hides my damper controls

barrier it also hides my damper controls
down<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:58.250> which<00:00:59.250> work<00:00:59.570> works<00:01:00.570> pretty<00:01:00.750> good

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
down here which work works pretty good

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:12.859 
down here which work works pretty good
my<00:01:02.609> firebox<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:05.030> 24<00:01:06.030> by<00:01:06.180> 24<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:07.110> 18<00:01:11.869> my

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
my firebox it's a 24 by 24 by 18 my

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
my firebox it's a 24 by 24 by 18 my
handle<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.799> chipping<00:01:14.070> hammer<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
handle is just chipping hammer I use the

is the first time I've fired it up my

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.640 
is the first time I've fired it up my
dampener<00:01:37.100> pretty<00:01:38.100> simple<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.380> got<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
dampener pretty simple I got a lot of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.469 
dampener pretty simple I got a lot of
calculations<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.490> line<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.880> hole<00:01:44.880> size<00:01:45.180> on

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
calculations on line for my hole size on

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
calculations on line for my hole size on
my<00:01:45.509> dampeners<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.960> size<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> firebox<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
my dampeners and size the firebox and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.050 
my dampeners and size the firebox and
stuff<00:01:50.960> pick<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.350> toolbox<00:01:53.280> has<00:01:53.729> swapped

table

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:19.960 

so<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.120> didn't<00:02:11.300> work<00:02:11.420> out<00:02:11.540> too<00:02:11.750> bad<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:18.970> so

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so I didn't work out too bad it's a so

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.020 
so I didn't work out too bad it's a so
not<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.780> heavy<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> tongues<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:22.070> still

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
not that heavy on the tongues I still

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.900 
not that heavy on the tongues I still
pick<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.330> up<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.600> move<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.840> around<00:02:24.760> which<00:02:25.760> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
pick it up and move it around which is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.900 
pick it up and move it around which is
what<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.090> wanted<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.100> did<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.220> my<00:02:28.400> second<00:02:28.820> one

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
what I wanted I did this my second one

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.130 
what I wanted I did this my second one
I've<00:02:29.060> built<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> other<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> bill<00:02:29.990> is

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
I've built the other one I bill is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.310 
I've built the other one I bill is
actually<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> 300<00:02:32.090> gallon<00:02:32.240> tank<00:02:32.720> it's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
actually on it's a 300 gallon tank it's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.360 
actually on it's a 300 gallon tank it's
an<00:02:33.410> upright<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> pickup<00:02:35.240> frame<00:02:35.540> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
an upright one on a pickup frame and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
an upright one on a pickup frame and
surprisingly<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.580> one<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.880> easy<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.270> move

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
surprisingly that one is easy to move

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.610 
surprisingly that one is easy to move
around<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.550> one<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.760> don't<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.120> no

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
around but this one I don't have no

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.570 
around but this one I don't have no
counterbalance<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.830> door<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.340> didn't

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
counterbalance on the door I didn't

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.460 
counterbalance on the door I didn't
think<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.760> needed<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:44.240> it's<00:02:45.110> really<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.410> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
think I needed one it's really not that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.590 
think I needed one it's really not that
heavy

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
heavy

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.200 
heavy
so<00:02:47.600> far<00:02:47.840> my<00:02:48.050> handle<00:02:48.410> she's<00:02:48.560> pipe<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.940> staying

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
so far my handle she's pipe it's staying

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:58.540 
so far my handle she's pipe it's staying
fairly<00:02:51.370> cool<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:55.670> two<00:02:55.880> racks<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.360> there<00:02:57.550> I'm

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
fairly cool have two racks in there I'm
