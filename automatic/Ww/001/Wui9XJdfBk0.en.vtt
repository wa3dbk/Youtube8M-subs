00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
pretty cool idea by a construction boy

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.960 
pretty cool idea by a construction boy
101<00:01:52.050> where<00:01:53.050> he<00:01:53.440> built<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.950> actual<00:01:54.400> roof<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
101 where he built the actual roof and

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.750 
101 where he built the actual roof and
then<00:01:55.380> punched<00:01:56.380> holes<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.220> replaced

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
then punched holes in it and replaced

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.340 
then punched holes in it and replaced
with<00:01:57.910> glass<00:01:58.330> instead<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.869> building<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
with glass instead of building the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.430 
with glass instead of building the
entire<00:01:59.650> thing<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.070> glass<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.869> still

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
entire thing in a glass and it still

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.160 
entire thing in a glass and it still
made<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.680> very<00:02:03.100> very<00:02:04.000> very<00:02:04.210> good<00:02:04.360> plated

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.090 
levels of the scene decks they're very
hard<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.220> me<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> sense<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.890> they're

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
hard to me not in the sense that they're

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.660 
hard to me not in the sense that they're
too<00:02:48.250> harsh

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
too harsh

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.090 
too harsh
I'm<00:02:49.120> trying<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.390> make<00:02:49.540> them<00:02:49.690> all<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.840> same<00:02:50.100> and
