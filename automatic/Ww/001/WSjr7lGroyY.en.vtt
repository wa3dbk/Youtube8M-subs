wrong with this game this game is not
well<00:06:49.870> written<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.500> felt<00:06:50.920> like<00:06:50.950> for<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.340> megabyte

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
well written it felt like for a megabyte

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.220 
well written it felt like for a megabyte
as<00:06:52.000> well<00:06:52.180> that<00:06:52.420> was<00:06:52.540> a<00:06:52.570> terrible<00:06:52.780> maneuver

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
as well that was a terrible maneuver

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.320 
as well that was a terrible maneuver
hell<00:06:53.980> because<00:06:54.160> the<00:06:54.370> games<00:06:54.550> look<00:06:54.760> for<00:06:54.940> megabyte

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
hell because the games look for megabyte

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.420 
hell because the games look for megabyte
isn't<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:55.750> think<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:56.200> on<00:06:56.560> a<00:06:56.590> double<00:06:57.010> check<00:06:57.220> see

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
isn't I think so on a double check see

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.250 
isn't I think so on a double check see
when<00:06:57.580> I<00:06:57.610> gave<00:06:57.850> us<00:06:58.000> for<00:06:58.270> megabyte<00:06:58.780> you<00:06:59.020> know

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
when I gave us for megabyte you know

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.350 
when I gave us for megabyte you know
it's<00:06:59.530> probably<00:06:59.770> not<00:07:00.070> going<00:07:00.250> to<00:07:00.310> get<00:07:00.460> even

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
it's probably not going to get even

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.160 
it's probably not going to get even
pac-man<00:07:02.050> is<00:07:02.260> probably<00:07:02.560> pushing<00:07:02.770> sex
