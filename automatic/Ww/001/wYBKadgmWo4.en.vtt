darkest corner of the cage at the moment

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.399 
darkest corner of the cage at the moment
I<00:01:26.729> definitely<00:01:27.450> would<00:01:27.600> recommend<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.110> cage

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
I definitely would recommend this cage

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
I definitely would recommend this cage
I've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.549> carefresh<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> floor<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:32.060> one

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of the bags of carefresh like the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the bags of carefresh like the
smaller<00:01:36.689> bags<00:01:36.960> does<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> whole<00:01:38.070> cage<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.640> you
