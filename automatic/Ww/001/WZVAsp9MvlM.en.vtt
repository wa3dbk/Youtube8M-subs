there<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.820> skins<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.870> tanks<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
there are skins for some tanks that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
there are skins for some tanks that
don't<00:01:08.190> have<00:01:08.430> skins<00:01:08.760> searches<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> tour<00:01:09.900> toys

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
don't have skins searches the tour toys
and<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.810> Elector<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.070> lower-tier<00:01:14.340> ones<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and the Elector the lower-tier ones is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
and the Elector the lower-tier ones is
because<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> lower<00:01:16.409> tier

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
because there's not a lot of lower tier

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
because there's not a lot of lower tier
skins<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.430> they're<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> hard<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> find

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
skins and they're kind of hard to find

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
skins and they're kind of hard to find
maybe<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.440> future<00:01:19.650> pack<00:01:19.979> i'll<00:01:20.190> have<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
maybe in a future pack i'll have all of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.810 
maybe in a future pack i'll have all of
the<00:01:21.240> tanks<00:01:21.540> available<00:01:22.050> but<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.160> now<00:01:23.190> it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the tanks available but for now it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
the tanks available but for now it's
gonna<00:01:24.000> remain<00:01:24.330> late<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> left<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.509> ptas<00:01:27.990> not

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
gonna remain late and left with ptas not

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.940 
gonna remain late and left with ptas not
ghosts<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.979> either<00:01:29.100> huh<00:01:30.530> before<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.830> i

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
ghosts get either huh before i think i

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.210 
ghosts get either huh before i think i
would<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.159> had<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> skin<00:01:32.610> by<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.290> anyways<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
would have had a skin by now anyways and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
would have had a skin by now anyways and
the<00:01:35.400> other<00:01:35.580> reason<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.330> HD

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the other reason is because of HD

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.710 
the other reason is because of HD
textures<00:01:37.789> because<00:01:38.789> it's<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.539> lot<00:01:39.690> harder

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
textures because it's just a lot harder

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.950 
textures because it's just a lot harder
to<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.440> skin<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.950> HD<00:01:41.340> textures<00:01:41.910> so<00:01:42.660> it's<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to do skin to HD textures so it's not a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.650 
to do skin to HD textures so it's not a
lot<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:43.979> any<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.550> all<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.450> something

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
lot of them if any at all but something

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.560 
lot of them if any at all but something
the<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.440> HD<00:01:46.770> takes<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.550> HD<00:01:48.240> texts

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the some HD takes do have two HD texts

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.710 
the some HD takes do have two HD texts
such<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.130> spa<00:01:50.130> panzer<00:01:50.670> ii<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:55.160> the
