00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
match up where the stock swing arm is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.750 
match up where the stock swing arm is
that<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.149> welding<00:00:46.190> has<00:00:47.190> done<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> all

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
data was all they did was get run stock

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.910 
data was all they did was get run stock
which<00:01:54.789> you<00:01:55.000> see<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.509> middle<00:01:55.840> still<00:01:56.679> around

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
tubing put it in a vise clamp it down

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.350 
tubing put it in a vise clamp it down
till<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.010> turns<00:02:12.160> over<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:13.030> take<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.209> little

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
till it turns over just take a little

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.199 
till it turns over just take a little
bit<00:02:13.569> at<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> time<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> matches<00:02:15.849> up<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
bit at a time so the matches up to the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.680 
bit at a time so the matches up to the
size<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.690> stock<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:19.060> wouldn't<00:02:19.480> either

would not recommend doing it with your
swing<00:02:23.170> arm<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.709> get<00:02:23.860> an<00:02:23.950> extra<00:02:24.250> swing<00:02:24.459> arm

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
swing arm just get an extra swing arm

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.500 
swing arm just get an extra swing arm
and<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:25.959> from<00:02:26.140> there<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:30.239> have<00:02:31.239> somebody
