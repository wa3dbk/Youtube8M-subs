00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 which is used when finishing the panels 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 there is already possible to put on the decorative 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 plaster or also on paint 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.149
 lacquer which contains glitter but 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 the cost of this varnish is about 30 dollars 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.910
 we go two I took the usual varnish 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 acrylic 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 can be panel can be front 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.350
 water based varnish 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.909
 I took glitter and I add it to a liter of varnish 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.540
 about 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.630
 Well, half a spoon somewhere here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 here is the amount but 220 times take on 1 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.390
 liter street and then here it is so loose this 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.280
 glitter 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.080
 after we poured the gripper into varnish 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.530
 lacquer binding at every pouring 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.530
 mix 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 because the flu itself can land on 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.070
 the bottom of the tank and will be roughly distributed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.950
 la fer and so I'll show you how much I have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.509
 it is already drawn 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 if you look here I poured a little 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.590
 I think it will be seen a little shimmer 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.880
 at the bottom of the cuvette 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 himself slabs 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.650
 when applying varnish with glitter also to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.250
 you need to mix 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.590
 why because when applied to the wall 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.020
 if you have glitter donkey benefits and it is even 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.120
 As regards factory varnish you can if 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.890
 roller and more where are you 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.989
 stayed on the roller just to be seen 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.630
 follow you inflicted 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.010
 more clitter strong movements roller 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.170
 strongly we are not home Komi 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.239
 Vlad so that there is no leakage fee 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 a little white drying issues he 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.660
 becomes with us if our covered 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.980
 just to look like that 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.650
 after applying varnish with 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.620
 additional glitter appears 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.100
 brilliance and if you see something appear 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 small sparkles 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.430
 I would like to pay attention when 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.650
 adding a liter does not mean at all that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.140
 the more give it will be more beautiful to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.160
 wo n't take the whole wall 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.440
 pour silver 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.310
 I add just enough to 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.680
 passing 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.579
 along the wall when the light changes 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.430
 appears 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.110
 where neither where such small sparkles in 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 In this case, we used glitter with 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.360
 varnish for decorative coating 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.280
 plaster 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.280
 thanks for watching up new videos 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.690
 I forgot to tell you 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.690
 varnish can be diluted with water by 30 percent
