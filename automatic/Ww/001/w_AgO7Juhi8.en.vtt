the idea is the only way you get to the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.340 
the idea is the only way you get to the
afterlife<00:01:25.730> is<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.510> die<00:01:26.750> right<00:01:27.430> yes<00:01:29.170> no<00:01:30.170> one

afterlife is to die right yes no one

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.770 
afterlife is to die right yes no one
ever<00:01:30.500> came<00:01:30.740> back<00:01:30.800> from<00:01:31.100> being<00:01:31.370> dead<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:32.720> is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
ever came back from being dead so how is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480 
ever came back from being dead so how is
it<00:01:32.960> possible<00:01:33.410> for<00:01:33.470> us<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.740> know<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.220> there<00:01:34.370> is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
it possible for us to know that there is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.030 
it possible for us to know that there is
such<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.760> thing<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.510> I<00:01:35.810> figured<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:36.920> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
such a thing so I figured it's just a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.130 
such a thing so I figured it's just a
way<00:01:37.160> for<00:01:37.610> us<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> comfort<00:01:38.540> each<00:01:38.630> other<00:01:38.840> when

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
way for us to comfort each other when

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.250 
way for us to comfort each other when
our<00:01:39.500> loved<00:01:39.710> ones<00:01:39.890> pass<00:01:40.100> away<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.990> passed

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
our loved ones pass away it's passed

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.140 
our loved ones pass away it's passed
down<00:01:42.410> from<00:01:42.890> ancestor<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:46.220> see<00:01:46.430> there'd<00:01:46.850> be<00:01:46.970> no

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
down from ancestor you see there'd be no

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.030 
down from ancestor you see there'd be no
way<00:01:47.330> from<00:01:47.570> our<00:01:47.660> ancestors<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.620> know<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:48.980> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
way from our ancestors to know for the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.330 
way from our ancestors to know for the
same<00:01:49.250> reasons<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.990> respect<00:01:51.500> ancestor

doing<00:02:44.810> we're<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:45.140> making<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.620> up<00:02:45.709> as<00:02:45.890> we<00:02:45.950> go

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
doing we're just making it up as we go

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.009 
doing we're just making it up as we go
along<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:50.420> be<00:02:50.600> ancestor<00:02:51.230> someday<00:02:52.690> when<00:02:53.690> we<00:02:53.870> go

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
along we be ancestor someday when we go

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.630 
along we be ancestor someday when we go
to<00:02:54.050> afterlife<00:02:57.160> okay<00:02:58.160> see<00:02:59.470> the<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.709> we

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
to afterlife okay see the thing is we

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400 
to afterlife okay see the thing is we
spend<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.269> time<00:03:02.330> trying<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.019> appease

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
spend all this time trying to appease

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.650 
spend all this time trying to appease
the<00:03:03.590> Mountain<00:03:03.920> spirit<00:03:04.280> but<00:03:05.060> nobody<00:03:05.510> ever

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the Mountain spirit but nobody ever

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.809 
the Mountain spirit but nobody ever
asked<00:03:06.080> if<00:03:07.010> there<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:08.360> Mountain<00:03:08.720> spirit

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
asked if there is the Mountain spirit

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.740 
asked if there is the Mountain spirit
there<00:03:10.819> is<00:03:11.060> meltin<00:03:11.540> spirit<00:03:13.269> I'm<00:03:14.269> thinking

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
there is meltin spirit I'm thinking

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.140 
there is meltin spirit I'm thinking
maybe<00:03:14.959> it's<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.650> tides<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.400> mean<00:03:17.030> we

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
maybe it's like the tides I mean we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.399 
maybe it's like the tides I mean we
don't<00:03:17.239> have<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:17.629> a<00:03:17.659> dance<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.170> make<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
don't have to do a dance to make the

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.949 
don't have to do a dance to make the
cards<00:03:18.799> come<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:19.609> tides<00:03:19.909> come<00:03:20.239> in<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
cards come in the tides come in the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.860 
cards come in the tides come in the
tides<00:03:21.230> go<00:03:21.469> out<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.980> no<00:03:22.310> amount<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.730> dancing<00:03:23.540> or

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
tides go out and no amount of dancing or

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.509 
tides go out and no amount of dancing or
throwing<00:03:24.170> food<00:03:24.530> away<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.920> going<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.129> stop<00:03:25.340> that

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
throwing food away is going to stop that

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.920 
throwing food away is going to stop that
tide<00:03:28.519> come<00:03:28.879> because<00:03:29.450> moon<00:03:31.209> yeah<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:32.569> I

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
tide come because moon yeah I know I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.490 
tide come because moon yeah I know I
know<00:03:33.730> that's<00:03:34.730> my<00:03:34.879> point<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.659> tides<00:03:35.959> are

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
know that's my point the tides are

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.849 
know that's my point the tides are
natural<00:03:37.129> maybe<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.870> ground<00:03:39.139> shakes<00:03:39.560> because

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
natural maybe the ground shakes because

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.099 
natural maybe the ground shakes because
of<00:03:40.250> some<00:03:40.489> natural<00:03:40.879> process<00:03:41.629> that<00:03:41.870> we<00:03:41.959> don't

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
of some natural process that we don't

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.280 
of some natural process that we don't
understand<00:03:42.650> maybe<00:03:43.459> it's<00:03:43.870> not<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.049> obvious

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
understand maybe it's not as obvious

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.750 
understand maybe it's not as obvious
because<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.980> doesn't<00:03:46.280> happen<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.669> regular

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
because it doesn't happen on a regular

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.300 
because it doesn't happen on a regular
cycle<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.720> times<00:03:47.989> maybe<00:03:48.769> there's<00:03:49.099> some

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
cycle like the times maybe there's some

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.670 
cycle like the times maybe there's some
huge<00:03:49.519> underground<00:03:49.939> fire<00:03:50.419> or<00:03:50.689> something<00:03:50.840> if

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
huge underground fire or something if

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.640 
huge underground fire or something if
that's<00:03:52.220> true<00:03:52.489> in<00:03:52.970> burnt<00:03:53.599> offerings<00:03:53.840> aren't

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
that's true in burnt offerings aren't

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.979 
that's true in burnt offerings aren't
going<00:03:54.829> to<00:03:54.950> help<00:03:57.159> maybe<00:03:58.159> but<00:03:58.609> what<00:03:58.879> hard<00:04:00.579> well

resources are pretty scarce and we don't

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.670 
resources are pretty scarce and we don't
want<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.430> waste<00:04:05.120> them<00:04:05.480> throw<00:04:06.260> them<00:04:06.409> down<00:04:06.560> the
