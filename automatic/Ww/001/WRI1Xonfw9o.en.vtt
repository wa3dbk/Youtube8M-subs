00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello dear friends, Swami Sea 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.570
 no cat and today we talk again 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 of such as many Easter eggs 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.179
 springtrape 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.279
 knew one pass and the rest 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.050
 Easter eggs on fnaf but let's talk a little 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.340
 well without further ado let's begin 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.429
 so we all know that in the trailer fnaf 3 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.590
 there were three animatronics old 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:37.969
 we all know and chica freddie and baths 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 To many Easter eggs they were years old should be 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.300
 they had to be full of us 3 they 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 there is but not all for example they are 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 phantoms 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.070
 but the carnage somehow I do not see why so 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.739
 same scott laid out in their trailer here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 maybe he meant that he see you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 will update the version and maybe there will be these 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.229
 old animatronics 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.140
 or it is quite possible that the battle will not 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.840
 also a phantom well who knows and we 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.500
 go further as you know fnaf 3 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 the main office has a box with 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.530
 animatronics from the second part well and hook 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.280
 Foxy from the first part so if 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 look closer you can see blood 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 streaks 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.380
 but I still lean that it drips 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 blood and take a look 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 the truth is very similar perhaps there are children in 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.149
 boxed in animatronics by 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.290
 past easter but I don't think so 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.560
 what do children like with costumes here 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.200
 fit yourself think there is still 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.960
 guess how costumes there 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.409
 fit a petro below huge against 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.799
 children and the box is so small but 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.569
 who knows and how according to the theory speak 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.160
 that these are all costumes and their endoskeleton 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.540
 disassemble and in order to 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.230
 again collect springtrap why was 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 take out 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.420
 endoskeleton after all as we know by 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 springtrap sits inside no endoskeleton 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.360
 purple man but if you look closely 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 yalu sprintrapa then you can see sticking 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.840
 right up until you look carefully 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.940
 take a closer look you can see that of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.290
 some places near springtrap 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 especially of the head sticking out of one wire 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.110
 out of ears 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.630
 2 of the head but if but if very 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.500
 take a close look inside this 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.440
 see a hole under his head 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.770
 notice that he has something inside 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.040
 very similar to a purple person but 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.160
 very much like wires 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.490
 but if there is nothing inside the springtrap 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.360
 then there is no skeleton so why with these 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.290
 costumes taken out indis endoskeletons and where 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.600
 they hit 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.420
 maybe they got into this new 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.370
 pizzeria where they sent these old 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.310
 broken by one motronic of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.000
 Well, who knows, but still a fact 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.470
 It remains a fact so now let's 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.800
 let's talk about fnaf1 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.560
 as you know the famous animatronic 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.440
 freddie phaseber is true he's a little 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.790
 different remember the second part all 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 old animatronics cleaned once tattered 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.200
 especially bonny but city 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.140
 its main upper part that is 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.800
 head torso and arms seem to be whole 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.050
 just holes, but look at this gleb 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.209
 Freddie fazber look at the first 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.810
 picture now look awarded 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.690
 I will disassemble from the second part see some 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.900
 ground holes still you stay so 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.970
 do you look at the first picture 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.770
 freddie fazber a little different first 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.440
 look closely at his cheeks on 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.930
 the first photo he had them 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.380
 big enough 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.190
 and here they are something small or 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:36.500
 I don't see them at all and his eyes 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.870
 some other ones are also worth it 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.130
 notice that the old in the parliament in the first 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.979
 parts are like points 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.979
 You see three dots on the cheeks near the nose 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.270
 same Freddy these points near the nose 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.180
 no maybe it's in communication this frege 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.380
 because he doesn't look like much 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.320
 except that color and only 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:12.500
 it's also worth noting that eyebrow so they 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.570
 also look like it is not dense 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:21.979
 and see how thin they are with 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:25.639
 the second part it can prove it 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.789
 it's not at all thats pass it just with 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.919
 similar suit but maybe inside him 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.289
 same on the skeleton who knows what 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.030
 can say from golden easter 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.389
 go through 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:44.630
 look at him in the first part he 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:49.370
 looks like he has no eyes 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:53.000
 no endoskeleton and a little bit 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.300
 changing some points from the eyes this 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.020
 just a point now look at 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.720
 golden radio operator fnaf2 take a look out of it 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.740
 stick wires he has enda skeleton 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:12.520
 if you look at his legs you see there 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:15.620
 there are some some traces 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.699
 look closely and color 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:23.240
 he has changed a little even eat it so 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:26.870
 and how does this fraga look 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:31.070
 carefully again on its shades the same 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.779
 most and Freddie disappeared again the same 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.270
 the very points of the nose 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.690
 they are present in gold 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:42.440
 from the first part and like this enemies 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:46.220
 some is missing in the second part of the same 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:50.720
 the story itself and his eyebrows and his eyes 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.710
 some others in general can actually 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.320
 also 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:07:01.130
 confirm that this is also not golden 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:04.070
 freddie and one more note i remember 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.910
 shadow enemies from the second part this too 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.760
 some easter egg many said it 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.670
 the golden city â€‹â€‹is very similar from its 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.540
 also sticking wires and golden enemies and 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:20.090
 he has no right ear like gold 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.630
 freddy instead because of this instead 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:28.670
 too, the wires stick out I still tend to 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:31.580
 to the fact that it is only that it is a phantom 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.970
 enemies from the third part are very similar and 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.340
 he is also missing his right ear is 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.850
 may well be just like 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:44.930
 the wires stick out from the same places 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:47.780
 Yes, and look closely By the way similar 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.480
 that's all dear friends thanks for 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:54.310
 view and forget to sign 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.310
 likes bye bye
