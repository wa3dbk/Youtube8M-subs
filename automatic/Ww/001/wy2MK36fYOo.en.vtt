mechanism so basically there's a lot of

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.980 
mechanism so basically there's a lot of
movement<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.840> could<00:02:47.080> do<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.800> chair

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
of course the the heart and once you get

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.650 
of course the the heart and once you get
a<00:02:55.810> lot<00:02:56.020> better<00:02:56.170> fabric<00:02:56.770> more<00:02:57.310> softer<00:02:58.150> feel<00:02:58.360> but
