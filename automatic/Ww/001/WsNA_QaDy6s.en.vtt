00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.670
 Medica 2010 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.920
 this presents his parents about the clinic staff flexible and in 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.519
 Real-time access to hospital information systems receives 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.009
 especially because we all appeal 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.820
 which I can quickly see their information, for example, diagnoses 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.939
 Laboratory findings that allow patients to view orders 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.279
 A rental car can be operated easily and intuitively 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.260
 In addition, the doctor receives much too happy to the desired data 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580
 if he starts the user the ERC has first a survey over 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.290
 Department of outpatient clinics that means he goes beyond the so-called 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.880
 Organizational units in the application and Francis Crippen heats 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.129
 with is the user login 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.419
 to his stations for example from Axway 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 active in data communication so that only the data is ensured 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639
 can see who are entitled to 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.499
 the first point is to and security only on registered users and 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.930
 Registered rescues are allowed at 21 degrees the second point 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.410
 is encryption 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.330
 the suffering of traffic but also Aladag 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.030
 who often did not express themselves by doing so 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.070
 reasonable 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.060
 Here was developed a winning together with the Knappschaftskrankenhaus 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.170
 Bochum that she presented the force of the Medica 7000 points for the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.369
 Hospital, it is a useful supplement 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.490
 the background of the act are enthusiastic about the peaceful but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.190
 you can tell that 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.490
 because she actually 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.550
 mobile requirement we brought with us to the talk has not one 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.390
 Overloaded is the serious car accident 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 Eating a rental car is a logical progression for her 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 app development is a strategic fusion of the two for us 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 Areas of Telecommunications and Healthcare 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 Here comes both components for the first time both 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.380
 Areas are very strong our company 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.140
 Here he was for the sake of ours 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.170
 push this further 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.200
 while the application is mineralized only the first step in the future will be too 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.089
 to be able to inform patient safety with goods 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.479
 Fidelity together with in hospital pull the patient as common 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.329
 founder time 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.469
 Our solutions should also be there for the patients at the end of the day 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.549
 Patient should be able to inform about his stay 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.669
 Patient should have the possibilities 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.719
 Percent on time bank for him planned the intervention that the 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 Patient should also be informed at home Hundt also technically goes the 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.859
 Development continues so will soon follow an app for the iPad 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 if not need 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.760
 in this sense
