00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
then jack that's it for theory number
one<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.680> these<00:01:22.890> theories<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.369> do

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
one but in all these theories I do

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
one but in all these theories I do

have the ace of hearts who is trafalgar
law<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> why<00:02:06.780> his<00:02:07.020> crew<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.350> called<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
law which is why his crew is called the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
law which is why his crew is called the
heart<00:02:08.489> pirates<00:02:08.970> also<00:02:09.420> maybe<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.899> he's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
heart pirates also maybe because he's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.720 
heart pirates also maybe because he's
famous<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.379> ripping<00:02:10.830> people's<00:02:11.099> hearts<00:02:11.459> out

of<00:02:12.000> their<00:02:12.120> chests<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.720> might<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
of their chests but that might be the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.520 
of their chests but that might be the
reason

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
reason

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
reason
why<00:02:13.620> he<00:02:13.830> was<00:02:13.920> given<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> position<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.819> heart

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
why he was given the position of heart

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.760 
why he was given the position of heart
now<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.690> third<00:02:15.959> theory<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> Don

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
now this third theory is that the Don

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.620 
now this third theory is that the Don

doflamingo is the Joker wild card which

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390 
doflamingo is the Joker wild card which
is<00:02:30.569> why<00:02:30.810> he<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.050> pretty<00:02:31.319> much<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> head<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
is why he is pretty much the head of the
