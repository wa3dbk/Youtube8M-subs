 become a power in this 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.809
 discipline yes the truth we come from the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.940
 selective was a very competitive 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.100
 strong at the national level and now 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.510
 we were selected several and we are going to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 give all 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.909
 in the world cup as it says is a very team 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.860
 strong and draw the claw to give what 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.200
 best of us after the medal 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.759
 Alejandra at the Olympic Games of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.680
 london this life of change ended up 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.880
 soon many cases but also because 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.549
 also the commitment to follow 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.930
 growing keep harvesting wins 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.350
 for the Barcelona World Cup, what is the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.740
 Personal goal for me after 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.780
 games and things have changed but I at 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.580
 otherwise I feel motivated did not offer 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.740
 or nothing I feel quiet motivated and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.360
 eager to make a good paper 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.979
 in the in the world 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 just enjoy it and give your best 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.630
 from me today at some point you can 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.630
 lose focus when so young you 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.960
 comes such an important result together 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.640
 with paola in the Olympiad you can 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.840
 losing that focus it was difficult to try to 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.149
 stay focused on what you should 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490
 do in having people that you want to be 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.590
 what helped you or you once you finished 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.390
 the competition of the other Olympians 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.120
 then you continued with your clear objective that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.110
 wants to continue growing as an athlete 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.270
 I still did not have time to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.970
 analyze everything after games I had 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.970
 more competitions right then yes 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.380
 it was like that olympic games something that 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 I will remember that he is always with me but 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 I also know that it 's something that happened and I 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 as you say I want to continue growing 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.370
 sportingly then it's something that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.850
 reason 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.790
 I want to continue giving results and because 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.440
 in the future let's see what happens we know that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 you have a great relationship with paola 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.060
 espinoza that is what you said it is your 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.500
 idol and that obviously keeps growing 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.570
 next to and now opportunities have 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.310
 a world championship will be she 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.860
 also there we already said several 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.690
 important the Mexicans what it means 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.630
 for you to keep growing next to it 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.580
 of an icon of Mexican sport 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.760
 I am really happy and excited 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.850
 of returning to the platform with her was 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.460
 a decision that we make very quickly 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.050
 before the selective one we already achieved 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.600
 classify so now we're going to be 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.360
 focused on in this competition for 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.830
 have a good comeback and give the best today 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.240
 you have to be many competitions to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.590
 international level and as you said 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.990
 after you finished the games 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160
 olympics, well, it's a hard ride 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.510
 the one that you have in different 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.000
 parts of the world in different parts of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.570
 Mexico you feel as a team what has 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.490
 noticed pressure to be in a certain way 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.990
 favorites because I told you it's a 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.820
 pride for us who follow 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.950
 the sport then that in the dives 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.750
 mexico is power is a reality is a 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.730
 country that constantly goes to different 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.530
 competitions and gets very good 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 results do you feel that pressure or 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.000
 On the contrary, it is a motivation that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.260
 got hand in hand with what happened 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.060
 many years ago what they are 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.740
 making you place mexico as 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.510
 high a difficult discipline 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.890
 discipline in which it is demanded as much as 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.620
 are the jobs 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.020
 if as I said I think more motivation 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.970
 because like mexico is going up 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.090
 the level in all countries today too 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.380
 is very strong in good more in men and 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.590
 is rising too the degree of 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.360
 difficulty all countries are already 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.280
 pulling everyone wants the first 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.680
 places then I think that this 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.500
 competition is an important one to go 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.420
 watching how to start the Olympic cycle 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.239
 as the other countries are going to draw faces 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.980
 new new talents that are going to be 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.410
 all the all four years not 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.790
 then that's where this competition 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.680
 it may be the opportunity for us 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.110
 Keep meeting the other athletes 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.060
 as well the level is clear that mexico 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.770
 it is already a world power in this subject 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.970
 of the dives and shows it with great 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.430
 different competence in which he has 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.620
 participated you and the entire national team 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.660
 nailed but also how far is 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.340
 of those of that power that China that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.320
 many speak of being invincible and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.280
 another planet is appearing 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.440
 and I think as the Chinese say and it's 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.120
 point and apart from that it seems that 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.890
 they were born for shots and dunks and almost 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:55.490
 it's almost very hard very strong they have a 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.830
 Very strict discipline work 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.900
 but where it is impossible not all 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.120
 countries and we also Mexicans 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.040
 then on that we go we are not going for 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.590
 meet our own goals for 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.870
 our own dreams like that and then there 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.210
 all destinations are being withdrawn 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.890
 the countries are going to look for the first 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.750
 Clear places, well, there they go 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.070
 approach or give us much pride that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.050
