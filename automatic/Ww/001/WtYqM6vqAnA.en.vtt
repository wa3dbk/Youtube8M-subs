basically a turbo mode you can do a lot

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.200 
basically a turbo mode you can do a lot
of<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> course<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
hit some awesome stunts we can catch up

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.499 
hit some awesome stunts we can catch up
with<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> police<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:53.909> rival<00:01:54.149> police

with the police you could rival police

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
with the police you could rival police
officer<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.470> basically<00:01:56.369> guys

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
officer there we go and basically guys

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
officer there we go and basically guys
when<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> RAM<00:01:57.240> someone<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> also<00:01:58.110> activate

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
when you RAM someone you also activate

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.249 
when you RAM someone you also activate
the<00:01:58.619> slow<00:01:58.860> motion<00:01:59.189> mode<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.930> initially<00:02:00.930> or

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the slow motion mode which initially or

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.670 
the slow motion mode which initially or
and<00:02:01.979> results<00:02:02.549> stops<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.210> turbo<00:02:03.630> mode<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.469> guys

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and results stops the turbo mode so guys

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
and results stops the turbo mode so guys
if<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> collision<00:02:05.820> with

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
if you like have a collision with

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.210 
if you like have a collision with
something<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.840> basically<00:02:07.229> stops<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.950> entire

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
something it basically stops the entire

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.169 
something it basically stops the entire
time<00:02:08.489> across

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
time across

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.179 
time across
so<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> bottom<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.769> see<00:02:10.859> it<00:02:11.039> there's

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
so at the bottom you can see it there's

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.709 
so at the bottom you can see it there's
a<00:02:11.250> red<00:02:11.459> bar<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.909> of<00:02:11.969> filling<00:02:12.269> up<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.569> that's

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
a red bar kind of filling up and that's

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.209 
a red bar kind of filling up and that's
basically<00:02:12.930> your<00:02:13.260> cooldown<00:02:13.799> time<00:02:14.040> for

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
basically your cooldown time for

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.520 
basically your cooldown time for
activating<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.849> turbo<00:02:15.120> system<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:16.290> about

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
activating the turbo system it's about

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500 
activating the turbo system it's about
five<00:02:16.799> seconds<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.340> would<00:02:17.489> say<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.969> after<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
five seconds I would say and after that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.670 
five seconds I would say and after that
time<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.930> basically<00:02:19.079> hit<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.469> turbo

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
time you can basically hit the turbo

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.429 
time you can basically hit the turbo
again<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:21.030> full<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:22.200> full

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
again and it will be full in full

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.050 
again and it will be full in full
capacity<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.189> could<00:02:23.340> go<00:02:23.430> ahead<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.879> use

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
capacity so you could go ahead and use

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
capacity so you could go ahead and use
it<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.239> your<00:02:24.480> liking<00:02:24.659> so<00:02:25.500> let's<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.739> ahead<00:02:25.769> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
turn it around and possibly try to hit a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.199 
turn it around and possibly try to hit a
stunt<00:02:28.139> using<00:02:28.590> Arturo<00:02:29.159> mode<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.939> I'm<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.180> to
