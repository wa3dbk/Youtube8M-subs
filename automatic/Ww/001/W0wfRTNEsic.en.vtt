I'm sure a lot of you noticed that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
I'm sure a lot of you noticed that
tactical<00:00:31.050> insertions<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.920> still<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
tactical insertions are still in the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.930 
tactical insertions are still in the
game<00:00:32.820> which<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.750> somewhat<00:00:34.710> baffling<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.579> um

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
game which is somewhat baffling to me um

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270 
game which is somewhat baffling to me um
and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:37.230> could<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> three<00:00:37.980> things

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and it could be one of three things

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.240 
and it could be one of three things
either<00:00:39.260> Trant<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.590> enjoys<00:00:40.920> watching

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
either Trant really enjoys watching

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.290 
either Trant really enjoys watching
sandy<00:00:42.120> ravaged<00:00:42.480> booster<00:00:42.899> justice<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:44.300> they're

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
sandy ravaged booster justice or they're

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950 
sandy ravaged booster justice or they're
just<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:46.020> stupid<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:47.270> they<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.539> added

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
just really stupid or they have added

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
just really stupid or they have added
some<00:00:49.260> sort<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.739> new<00:00:50.610> feature<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
some sort of new feature to it to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
some sort of new feature to it to
balance<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.199> prevent<00:00:52.680> boosters<00:00:53.190> from

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
balance it and prevent boosters from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
balance it and prevent boosters from
doing<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.629> their<00:00:54.870> shenanigans<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.890> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
doing all their shenanigans and I really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700 
doing all their shenanigans and I really
hope<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> third<00:00:57.059> option<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
hope it's the third option because as of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
hope it's the third option because as of
right<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.579> can't<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.570> any

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
right now I just can't really see any

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
right now I just can't really see any
logical<00:01:01.350> reasoning<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.039> why<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.579> would

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
logical reasoning for why they would

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
logical reasoning for why they would
include<00:01:03.000> tactical<00:01:03.660> insertions<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
include tactical insertions back in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
include tactical insertions back in
black<00:01:05.519> ops<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.030> no<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.750> uses

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
black ops because no one really uses

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.670 
black ops because no one really uses
them<00:01:07.260> except<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.860> boosters<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.409> mean

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
them except for boosters but I mean

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.310 
them except for boosters but I mean
anyway<00:01:11.040> we'll<00:01:11.970> we'll<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> wait<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
anyway we'll we'll just have to wait and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.920 
anyway we'll we'll just have to wait and
see<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.460> problem<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.869> people

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

may<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:11.890> seen<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.370> video<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.640> posted<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.660> month

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
may have seen the video I posted a month

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.339 
may have seen the video I posted a month
ago<00:02:14.290> or<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.790> basically<00:02:16.510> had<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:17.140> little

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
ago or so that basically had a little

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.619 
ago or so that basically had a little
segment<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:18.010> me<00:02:18.160> wishing<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.940> stopping

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
segment of me wishing that stopping

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.960 
segment of me wishing that stopping
power<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.349> juggernaut<00:02:21.190> we'd<00:02:21.430> both<00:02:21.640> be

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
power and juggernaut we'd both be

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.630 
power and juggernaut we'd both be
removed<00:02:22.390> from<00:02:22.660> future<00:02:22.989> Call<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.200> Duty's<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:24.610> I

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
removed from future Call of Duty's now I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.610 
removed from future Call of Duty's now I
don't<00:02:24.970> think<00:02:25.209> Treyarch<00:02:25.599> saw<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.989> video<00:02:26.200> but

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
don't think Treyarch saw that video but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.190 
don't think Treyarch saw that video but
we<00:02:27.160> must<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.549> had<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.849> same<00:02:28.120> sort<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.690> train

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
we must have had the same sort of train

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.289 
we must have had the same sort of train
of<00:02:29.349> thought<00:02:29.560> because<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.280> turns<00:02:30.819> out<00:02:31.030> there

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
of thought because it turns out there

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.970 
of thought because it turns out there
will<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.480> no<00:02:31.750> stopping<00:02:32.080> power<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.739> no

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
will be no stopping power and no

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.190 
will be no stopping power and no
juggernaut<00:02:33.549> which<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:34.000> sort<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> dream<00:02:35.140> come

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
juggernaut which is sort of a dream come

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.619 
juggernaut which is sort of a dream come
true<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.769> it's<00:02:36.040> awesome<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.730> free<00:02:37.450> up

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
true I think it's awesome to free up

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.979 
true I think it's awesome to free up
that<00:02:37.900> second<00:02:38.560> perk<00:02:38.769> slot<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.750> can

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
that second perk slot so that you can

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.479 
that second perk slot so that you can
have<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.500> variety<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.160> game<00:02:42.310> it's

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
have more variety in the game it's

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.789 
have more variety in the game it's
pretty<00:02:42.970> cool<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:44.110> only<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.680> they

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
pretty cool and not only that but they

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.949 
pretty cool and not only that but they
really<00:02:45.190> switched<00:02:45.610> around<00:02:46.030> all<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.480> perks<00:02:46.720> in

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
really switched around all the perks in

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.869 
really switched around all the perks in
the<00:02:47.079> game<00:02:47.260> likes<00:02:47.530> steady<00:02:48.340> aim<00:02:48.549> is<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:48.849> a

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
the game likes steady aim is now a

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.740 
the game likes steady aim is now a
second<00:02:49.420> perk<00:02:50.459> hardline<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.730> first<00:02:52.030> perk<00:02:52.420> it's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
second perk hardline is first perk it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.420 
second perk hardline is first perk it's
it's<00:02:53.319> just<00:02:53.590> totally<00:02:53.980> flipped

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's just totally flipped

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.220 
it's just totally flipped
I<00:02:54.459> think<00:02:54.700> it'll<00:02:54.819> add<00:02:55.000> some<00:02:55.030> new<00:02:55.450> dynamics<00:02:56.079> to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
I think it'll add some new dynamics to

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.589 
I think it'll add some new dynamics to
the<00:02:56.349> game<00:02:56.530> at<00:02:56.890> least<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.250> hope<00:02:57.430> so

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
the game at least I hope so

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.339 
the game at least I hope so
and<00:02:58.870> also<00:02:59.730> well<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.450> wager<00:03:01.690> matches

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
and also well we have the wager matches

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.440 
and also well we have the wager matches
which<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.799> think<00:03:03.099> are<00:03:03.220> very<00:03:03.250> very<00:03:03.849> cool<00:03:04.180> I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
which I think are very very cool I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.000 
which I think are very very cool I
didn't<00:03:05.109> know<00:03:05.230> they<00:03:05.379> were<00:03:05.410> taken<00:03:05.859> out<00:03:05.980> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
didn't know they were taken out of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130 
didn't know they were taken out of
Counter<00:03:06.400> Strike<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.299> am<00:03:07.420> NOT<00:03:07.629> a<00:03:07.660> PC

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
Counter Strike because I am NOT a PC

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.949 
Counter Strike because I am NOT a PC
player<00:03:08.319> at<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:08.950> apparently<00:03:09.900> they<00:03:10.900> were

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
player at all but apparently they were

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.500 
player at all but apparently they were
taken<00:03:11.680> directly<00:03:12.099> out<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.819> certain<00:03:13.060> Counter

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
taken directly out of a certain Counter

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.420 
taken directly out of a certain Counter
Strike<00:03:13.540> game-mode<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.739> everyone<00:03:15.250> loves

Counter<00:03:15.790> Strike<00:03:15.819> I've<00:03:16.150> never<00:03:16.359> heard<00:03:16.540> anyone

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
Counter Strike I've never heard anyone

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.589 
Counter Strike I've never heard anyone
ever<00:03:17.319> in<00:03:17.920> history<00:03:18.250> complain<00:03:18.910> about<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.359> game

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
ever in history complain about that game

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.289 
ever in history complain about that game
so<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.959> take<00:03:20.349> something<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.130> is

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
so to take something out of it is

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.599 
so to take something out of it is
probably<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.389> good<00:03:22.660> move<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:23.230> Treyarch<00:03:24.099> part

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
probably a good move on Treyarch part

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.020 
probably a good move on Treyarch part
and<00:03:24.910> i<00:03:25.419> think<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.139> was<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.919> cool<00:03:27.310> idea<00:03:27.760> all

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and i think it was a very cool idea all

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.180 
and i think it was a very cool idea all
these<00:03:28.239> various<00:03:28.840> game<00:03:29.139> modes<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:30.010> wager

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
hickey mod there was another one where

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.710 
hickey mod there was another one where
you<00:03:44.950> all<00:03:45.130> start<00:03:45.459> off<00:03:45.579> with<00:03:45.790> scorpions<00:03:46.419> it

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
you all start off with scorpions it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.089 
you all start off with scorpions it
seemed<00:03:46.989> kind<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:47.290> old<00:03:47.560> school<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.010> then

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
seemed kind of like old school and then

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.890 
seemed kind of like old school and then
your<00:03:48.190> guns<00:03:48.400> just<00:03:48.910> switch<00:03:49.150> around<00:03:49.450> at<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.690> same

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
your guns just switch around at the same

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.710 
your guns just switch around at the same
time<00:03:50.169> very<00:03:50.980> cool<00:03:51.340> stuff<00:03:51.639> I'm<00:03:51.910> looking<00:03:52.359> forward

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
time very cool stuff I'm looking forward

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.159 
time very cool stuff I'm looking forward
to<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.410> unfortunately<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:55.660> looked<00:03:55.959> like

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
to that but unfortunately it looked like

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.990 
to that but unfortunately it looked like
on<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.380> other<00:03:56.500> hand<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.950> kill<00:03:57.220> streak<00:03:57.519> system

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
on the other hand the kill streak system

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.319 
on the other hand the kill streak system
is<00:03:58.269> still<00:03:58.720> kind<00:03:59.109> of<00:03:59.230> over-the-top<00:03:59.769> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
is still kind of over-the-top and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.879 
is still kind of over-the-top and
overpowered<00:04:01.329> there's<00:04:02.109> still<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.380> chopper

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
overpowered there's still a chopper

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.780 
overpowered there's still a chopper
gunner<00:04:03.180> dogs<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:05.049> RC<00:04:05.829> car<00:04:05.859> seems<00:04:06.430> really

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
gunner dogs the RC car seems really

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.449 
gunner dogs the RC car seems really
ridiculous<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.540> me<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:08.470> might<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:08.859> be<00:04:08.919> me<00:04:09.220> I

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
ridiculous to me that might just be me I

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.640 
ridiculous to me that might just be me I
don't<00:04:10.209> know<00:04:10.269> what<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.510> guys<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.989> about<00:04:11.139> it

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
don't know what you guys think about it

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.530 
don't know what you guys think about it
we'll<00:04:11.889> just<00:04:12.129> have<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.430> see<00:04:12.579> how<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.760> goes<00:04:12.940> I'm

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
we'll just have to see how that goes I'm

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.870 
we'll just have to see how that goes I'm
not<00:04:13.989> particularly<00:04:14.680> looking<00:04:15.280> forward<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.759> it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
not particularly looking forward to it

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.279 
not particularly looking forward to it
though<00:04:16.030> after<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:16.449> seeing<00:04:16.690> what<00:04:16.810> Hotch<00:04:16.989> said

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
though after it seeing what Hotch said

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.180 
though after it seeing what Hotch said
in<00:04:17.440> his<00:04:17.590> videos

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
in his videos

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.819 
in his videos
it<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.850> seems<00:04:19.090> super<00:04:19.810> overpowered

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
it just seems super overpowered

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.559 
it just seems super overpowered
and<00:04:20.919> annoying<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:21.729> everyone<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.330> team

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569 
and annoying if everyone on the team

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.749 
and annoying if everyone on the team
hasn't<00:04:22.810> said<00:04:23.169> is<00:04:23.319> their<00:04:23.530> third<00:04:23.770> killstreak<00:04:24.340> or

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
hasn't said is their third killstreak or

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.469 
hasn't said is their third killstreak or
excuse<00:04:25.210> me

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
excuse me

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.779 
excuse me
obtaining<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.289> getting<00:04:27.129> three<00:04:27.370> kills<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.729> a

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
obtaining it on getting three kills in a

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.990 
obtaining it on getting three kills in a
row<00:04:27.909> that<00:04:28.840> would<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.229> get<00:04:29.409> really<00:04:29.919> crazy<00:04:30.550> I

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
row that would just get really crazy I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.159 
row that would just get really crazy I
I'm<00:04:31.599> just<00:04:32.080> imagining<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.949> all<00:04:33.099> right<00:04:33.759> now<00:04:34.169> but

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
I'm just imagining it all right now but

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.850 
I'm just imagining it all right now but
finally<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.680> think<00:04:35.830> that's<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:37.360> whole

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
finally I think that's the the whole

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.040 
finally I think that's the the whole
system<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:39.039> unlocking<00:04:39.789> things<00:04:40.090> with<00:04:40.599> money

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
system of unlocking things with money

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.740 
system of unlocking things with money
instead<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.620> by<00:04:41.800> leveling<00:04:42.250> up<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.610> very<00:04:43.479> cool

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
instead of by leveling up is very cool

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.649 
instead of by leveling up is very cool
so<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:45.009> sort<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.310> rewards<00:04:45.879> you<00:04:46.060> for<00:04:46.330> being<00:04:46.539> a

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
so it sort of rewards you for being a

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.899 
so it sort of rewards you for being a
good<00:04:46.870> player<00:04:47.080> as<00:04:47.469> opposed<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.699> just

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
good player as opposed for to just

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.490 
good player as opposed for to just
playing<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.509> game<00:04:49.689> for<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.960> certain<00:04:50.229> amount<00:04:50.349> of

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
playing the game for a certain amount of

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.559 
playing the game for a certain amount of
time<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.830> level<00:04:51.009> up<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.400> actually<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.360> do

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
time to level up you actually if you do

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.089 
time to level up you actually if you do
well<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.810> get<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:53.169> good<00:04:53.379> kill<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.800> death<00:04:53.949> ratio

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
well you get a good kill to death ratio

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.790 
well you get a good kill to death ratio
play<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.879> objective<00:04:55.000> go<00:04:55.719> for<00:04:55.930> contracts<00:04:56.650> and
