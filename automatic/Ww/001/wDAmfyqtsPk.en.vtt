00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.130
We take approximately 2m of knitted i-cord and leave a 16cm margin

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.010
And we start knitting

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.190
We knit always towards the same direction

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120
We pass the first ring through

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.230
In case that it won't fit, we slightly burn the edge of the cord

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.020
We pass the second ring through 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.130
And the third one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.120
We continue knitting

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.120
We center the position of the rings

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.120
We pass the cord through and stretch it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.130
We measure 16cm

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:33.130
And we cut and burn the edge

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:47.130
We pass the big rings through

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:15.130
And we cement the terminals using super glue

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:42.130
We put a small hoop on each ring

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.130
And we also put the clasp on

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.130
And finally it's ready!
