00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.450
 let's solve the equation x square plus x 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.580
 5 equal to 0 in c 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.230
 solve it in c the process is the same 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.809
 to solve the nr but 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.250
 what you have to do is calculate 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.250
 the solutions in c 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.810
 let's see how to make x square 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.949
 x + 5 equal to 0 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.790
 x would be equal to minus b coefficient nothing 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:38.440
 x is 1 - 1 - square root must to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:41.379
 square 1 squared minus 4 times 1 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.680
 five matches of 2 per 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.579
 we have less 1 less root 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.449
 square 1 block 21 minus 4 times 1 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 five minus twenty matches of 2 this 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:00.549
 there is less 1 more minus square root of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.129
 120 minus 19 match for 2 let's watch 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.340
 that we have a negative root that 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.090
 means that this has no solution in 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.430
 r because as we know in r the roots of 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.640
 Negative numbers can not be made 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.310
 nevertheless we work in ence 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.190
 any equation with coefficients 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.990
 Polynomials can be solved with 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.410
 coefficients in January teo can be 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.410
 solve 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.370
 in our case 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 are more that can be resolved is going to 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.740
 have a solution 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.590
 in our case minus one plus minus root 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 square minus 19 matches if this 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 would have adapted a square root of a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.470
 positive number in the solutions 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 would have been real and as we know 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 all real numbers all cee number 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.040
 that would be resolved in this case 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.800
 to get the complex solutions 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 since real does not have we will have less 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.570
 1 + less square root of minus 19 than 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.070
 what we have inside we can put it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.070
 19 x minus 1 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.399
 and this minus one plus minus something that does not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.710
 can be done in 19 you can not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.350
 because we are martin manipulating things 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.160
 that do not make sense now let's remember 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.010
 that y is the imaginary unit and this is 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.650
 root of minus 1 then this would be less 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.890
 one more minus root of 19 that has 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
 total sense for it seems less one that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.610
 is the unit 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.030
 date imagine the match 2 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 and this remains for a part minus 1 + 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.620
 root of 19 and split by 2 and now less 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.620
 1 less 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.890
 the top minus one more half root of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.060
 19 match for 2 and the one below 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.940
 less a means now more less root than 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.830
 19 match by two for and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.050
 then we have the solutions 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.890
 complex numbers that satisfy the 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.500
 equation 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.280
 raised therefore we have solved 11 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.280
 of that equation 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.430
 as I said in the case that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.100
 we were solving on r when 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.930
 we come to this step we will say no 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.400
 solution and we would finish everything down 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.409
 surplus 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.450
 in the case to be solved lance 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.209
 you will always be able to follow 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.480
 you get to these two solutions in this 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.480
 case
