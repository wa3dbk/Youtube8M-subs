breather<00:00:45.899> thing<00:00:46.320> doesn't<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
breather thing doesn't look like it's it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.950 
breather thing doesn't look like it's it
has<00:00:48.120> been<00:00:49.430> used<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.700> much<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.360> upper<00:00:51.719> part

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
