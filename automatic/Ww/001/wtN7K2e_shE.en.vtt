hey guys
Glasgow<00:00:20.350> survival<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:20.950> today<00:00:21.160> we're<00:00:21.760> going

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
Glasgow survival and today we're going

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.000 
Glasgow survival and today we're going
to<00:00:21.970> demonstrate<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.720> primitive<00:00:23.560> fire-making

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
to demonstrate a primitive fire-making

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.530 
to demonstrate a primitive fire-making
technique<00:00:24.640> known<00:00:24.820> as<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.150> flint<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.510> steel

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
technique known as the flint and steel

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.650 
technique known as the flint and steel
and<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.619> lot<00:00:27.610> of<00:00:27.700> people<00:00:27.880> say<00:00:28.090> that<00:00:28.330> this<00:00:28.450> said

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
and a lot of people say that this said

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.790 
and a lot of people say that this said
'no<00:00:28.750> primitive<00:00:29.080> technique<00:00:29.349> because<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.710> was

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
'no primitive technique because it was

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.890 
'no primitive technique because it was
used<00:00:30.040> for<00:00:30.099> such<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.340> long<00:00:30.550> time<00:00:30.580> but<00:00:31.090> if<00:00:31.630> you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
used for such a long time but if you

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.840 
used for such a long time but if you
think<00:00:32.169> about<00:00:32.260> it<00:00:32.559> in<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:33.010> sense<00:00:33.220> that<00:00:33.340> Native

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
think about it in the sense that Native

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.729 
think about it in the sense that Native
Americans<00:00:33.910> were<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.989> know<00:00:35.110> doing<00:00:35.379> friction

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
Americans were you know doing friction

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.890 
Americans were you know doing friction
fires<00:00:36.010> well<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:36.879> know<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.330> couple<00:00:37.809> hundred

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
fires well you know a couple hundred

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.619 
fires well you know a couple hundred
years<00:00:38.110> before<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:38.590> across<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.790> water<00:00:40.059> you

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
years before that across the water you

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.080 
years before that across the water you
know<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:41.050> Romans<00:00:41.710> were<00:00:42.129> using<00:00:42.370> flint<00:00:43.000> and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
know the Romans were using flint and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.350 
know the Romans were using flint and
steel

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
steel

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.620

you<00:00:43.870> know<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.140> Vikings<00:00:44.650> so<00:00:45.269> it's<00:00:46.269> considered

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
you know the Vikings so it's considered

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.960 
you know the Vikings so it's considered
a<00:00:46.780> primitive<00:00:47.380> fire-making<00:00:47.559> technique<00:00:48.220> but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
a primitive fire-making technique but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.400 
a primitive fire-making technique but
I'm<00:00:49.420> go<00:00:49.630> ahead<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:49.840> show<00:00:49.930> you<00:00:50.020> what<00:00:50.110> semi

similar to like an Altoids ten I got a

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.400 
similar to like an Altoids ten I got a
hole<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.850> top<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.449> make<00:01:04.660> users<00:01:05.259> from

have my actual steel and you need to use

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.190 
have my actual steel and you need to use
a<00:01:22.509> high<00:01:23.110> carbon<00:01:23.649> steel<00:01:23.890> nice<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.399> is<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
a high carbon steel nice so this is you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.630 
a high carbon steel nice so this is you
can<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.500> your<00:01:26.619> knife<00:01:26.890> or<00:01:27.160> whatever<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.580> I'll

onto your tender file let me go and get

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:25.590 
onto your tender file let me go and get
some<00:04:16.380> charcoal

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.810 

and<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.530> reason<00:04:26.890> why<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.040> have<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.250> use<00:04:27.370> char

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
and the reason why you have to use char

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.320 
and the reason why you have to use char
cloth<00:04:28.030> for<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:28.840> or<00:04:29.110> char<00:04:29.320> material<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.330> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
cloth for this or char material is that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.840 
cloth for this or char material is that
the<00:04:31.690> sparks<00:04:32.230> off<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.070> only<00:04:33.250> about<00:04:33.520> 800

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
the sparks off this is only about 800

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.200 
the sparks off this is only about 800
degrees<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.560> know<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.950> fair<00:04:36.700> cm<00:04:37.030> rod

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
degrees and you know like a fair cm rod

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.340 
degrees and you know like a fair cm rod
throws<00:04:37.480> 54<00:04:38.050> 400<00:04:38.650> degree<00:04:39.180> sparks<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:41.230> is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
throws 54 400 degree sparks so this is

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.110 
throws 54 400 degree sparks so this is
very<00:04:41.500> low<00:04:41.740> temperature<00:04:42.130> spark<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:42.790> need

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
very low temperature spark so you need

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.370 
very low temperature spark so you need
something<00:04:43.540> that's<00:04:43.570> already<00:04:43.810> charred<00:04:44.170> that

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
something that's already charred that

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.230 
something that's already charred that
will<00:04:44.500> take<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> spark<00:04:45.220> easily<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.000> can

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
will take a spark easily but you can

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.140 
will take a spark easily but you can
either<00:04:46.390> put<00:04:46.720> your<00:04:47.050> char<00:04:47.290> cloth<00:04:47.440> on<00:04:47.770> top<00:04:48.120> or<00:04:49.120> on

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
either put your char cloth on top or on

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.210 
either put your char cloth on top or on
bottom<00:04:49.300> I've<00:04:50.230> actually<00:04:50.470> seen<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.070> work<00:04:51.190> just

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
bottom I've actually seen it work just

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.830 
bottom I've actually seen it work just
as<00:04:51.610> good<00:04:51.700> both<00:04:52.120> ways

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
as good both ways

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.710 
as good both ways
so<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:54.190> really<00:04:54.520> doesn't<00:04:54.730> matter<00:04:54.850> now<00:04:55.390> let's<00:04:55.570> go

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
so it really doesn't matter now let's go

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.210 
so it really doesn't matter now let's go
ahead<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.020> do<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.500> basically<00:04:56.680> just<00:04:57.010> sit

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
ahead and do this and basically just sit

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.550 
ahead and do this and basically just sit
it<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.370> top<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.700> your<00:04:57.940> stone<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.350> your

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
it on top of your stone like that your
