hug me but as you can see there there's
the<00:00:19.380> 200<00:00:20.130> millimeter<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.330> spam<00:00:21.570> filter<00:00:21.920> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the 200 millimeter the spam filter this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.490 
the 200 millimeter the spam filter this
is<00:00:23.160> touched<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:23.939> magnets<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.199> really

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is touched by magnets so it's really

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.670 
is touched by magnets so it's really
convenient<00:00:26.000> dhoni<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.180> those<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.680> adhesive

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
convenient dhoni for those the adhesive

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
convenient dhoni for those the adhesive
tapes<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.310> stick<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.570> goes<00:00:30.720> on

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
tapes so stick on there and it goes on

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
tapes so stick on there and it goes on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
see dust building up there that if you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
see dust building up there that if you
see<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> well<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.250> days

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
see that you see that well two days

see that you see that well two days
leave<00:00:41.940> two<00:00:42.270> days<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.989> having<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.350> actually

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
leave two days so having this actually

leave two days so having this actually
helps<00:00:44.660> even<00:00:45.660> though<00:00:45.780> I've<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.379> front

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
helps even though I've got my front

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
helps even though I've got my front
panel<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.600> caked

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
panel there and you can see that's caked

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.650 
panel there and you can see that's caked
with<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.379> lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> dust<00:00:50.070> I've<00:00:50.820> also<00:00:51.030> amounts<00:00:51.510> one

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
with a lot of dust I've also amounts one

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.189 
with a lot of dust I've also amounts one
of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.199> well<00:00:52.910> 220<00:00:53.910> million<00:00:54.090> fans<00:00:54.510> dust

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of the top as well 220 million fans dust

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.760 
of the top as well 220 million fans dust
filters<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.760> stuck<00:00:57.120> by<00:00:57.329> magnets<00:00:57.780> because

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
filters it's stuck by magnets because

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
filters it's stuck by magnets because
the<00:00:59.129> way<00:00:59.280> i<00:00:59.309> mounted<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.899> bolts<00:01:01.289> are

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the way i mounted it the bolts are

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
the way i mounted it the bolts are
coming<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.980> rooting<00:01:02.640> through<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.570> had

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
coming up and rooting through so I had

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.490 
coming up and rooting through so I had
to<00:01:04.220> use<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.060> adapter<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to use the the the adapter or what we

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
to use the the the adapter or what we
call<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.860> basically<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
call it's basically this side is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
call it's basically this side is
adhesive<00:01:12.840> tape<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
adhesive tape and what you do is you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
adhesive tape and what you do is you
stick<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.909> top<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> fan<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> back

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
stick it on top of the fan or the back

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
stick it on top of the fan or the back
of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> case<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.860> wherever<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> plastic<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of the case or wherever is plastic and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
of the case or wherever is plastic and
what<00:01:18.689> happens<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> magnet

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
what happens is you just use that magnet

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.789 
what happens is you just use that magnet
strip<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.420> attach<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
strip there to attach it to that it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.719 
strip there to attach it to that it
should<00:01:23.100> work<00:01:23.520> automatically<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.729> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
should work automatically like that so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.319 
should work automatically like that so
yeah<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.720> stuck<00:01:28.100> so

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
yeah so as you can see it's stuck so

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.350 
yeah so as you can see it's stuck so
yeah<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> goes<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.799> quite<00:01:32.009> nicely

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
yeah so it goes on there quite nicely

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
yeah so it goes on there quite nicely
sticks<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.509> there<00:01:33.689> doesn't<00:01:33.960> move<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.829> that's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
sticks on there doesn't move and that's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.910 
sticks on there doesn't move and that's
it<00:01:35.189> firmly<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.350> amount<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> dust

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it firmly on there the amount of dust

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
it firmly on there the amount of dust
it's<00:01:38.159> picked<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.060> last<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:39.479> days<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's picked up in the last two days of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's picked up in the last two days of
having<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.850> incredible

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.780 

obviously<00:01:46.570> that's<00:01:46.720> inside<00:01:46.990> my<00:01:47.110> system

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
obviously that's inside my system

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.830 
obviously that's inside my system
nothing's<00:01:48.790> changed<00:01:49.330> like<00:01:49.480> I<00:01:49.510> said<00:01:49.720> I've

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
nothing's changed like I said I've

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.590 
nothing's changed like I said I've
melted<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.290> fan<00:01:50.530> there<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.040> blow<00:01:51.420> give<00:01:52.420> give

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
melted that fan there to blow give give

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.240 
melted that fan there to blow give give
good<00:01:52.810> airflow<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.350> graphics<00:01:53.800> card<00:01:54.010> so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
good airflow to the graphics card so

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.220 
good airflow to the graphics card so
it's<00:01:54.400> pushing<00:01:54.580> through<00:01:54.940> handle<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:55.900> bank

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
it's pushing through handle to the bank

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's pushing through handle to the bank
which<00:01:56.770> allows<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.160> another<00:01:57.400> one<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.550> well

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
which allows it another one as well

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.180 
which allows it another one as well
using<00:01:58.510> some<00:01:58.890> double-sided<00:01:59.890> adhesive<00:02:00.280> pads

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.040 

when<00:02:06.190> sort<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.490> state<00:02:06.610> drives<00:02:06.940> while<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:07.900> was

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
when sort of state drives while I was

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.450 
when sort of state drives while I was
pretty<00:02:08.410> dusty<00:02:10.200> obviously<00:02:11.200> all<00:02:11.350> have<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.740> clean

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
pretty dusty obviously all have to clean

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.760 
pretty dusty obviously all have to clean
at<00:02:12.610> some<00:02:12.880> point<00:02:13.150> but<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.750> was<00:02:13.990> before<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.710> was

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770

at some point but this was before I was
using<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:16.030> hopefully<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.510> will

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
using this so hopefully this will

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.430 
using this so hopefully this will
probably<00:02:17.590> help<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:19.780> bit<00:02:19.900> better<00:02:20.110> I
