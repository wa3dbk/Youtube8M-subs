looking at the bottom menu you can see
we<00:00:14.230> have<00:00:14.380> various<00:00:14.770> parameters<00:00:15.370> if<00:00:15.610> we<00:00:15.790> go<00:00:15.969> to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
we have various parameters if we go to

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.240 
we have various parameters if we go to

setup it comes to expose sub menus now
the<00:00:21.310> first<00:00:21.580> one<00:00:21.730> we'll<00:00:21.910> look<00:00:21.939> at<00:00:22.240> is<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.930> spans

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
the first one we'll look at is the spans

menu which is here this is a quick way
to<00:00:27.220> change<00:00:27.669> what's<00:00:28.000> on<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.360> screen<00:00:28.599> without

having to go through the various other

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.420 
having to go through the various other
methods<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:32.140> for<00:00:32.470> example<00:00:32.980> if<00:00:33.130> we<00:00:33.250> want<00:00:33.400> to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
methods so for example if we want to

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.810 
methods so for example if we want to
look<00:00:33.520> at<00:00:33.670> 8<00:00:33.850> gigahertz<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:35.350> 100<00:00:35.950> megahertz

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
look at 8 gigahertz to 100 megahertz

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.139 
look at 8 gigahertz to 100 megahertz
waking<00:00:37.480> Hertz<00:00:37.720> we<00:00:38.140> just<00:00:38.350> click<00:00:38.560> on<00:00:38.739> that

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
waking Hertz we just click on that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.990 
waking Hertz we just click on that
select<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.930> shuts<00:00:41.170> down<00:00:41.289> to<00:00:41.620> there<00:00:42.000> same

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
select and it shuts down to there same

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.360 
select and it shuts down to there same
thing<00:00:43.030> goes<00:00:43.480> if<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:43.960> want<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.199> look<00:00:44.289> at<00:00:44.469> up<00:00:44.769> to<00:00:45.070> 3

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
thing goes if we want to look at up to 3

thing goes if we want to look at up to 3
gig<00:00:45.670> which<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.090> probably<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:47.109> thing<00:00:47.320> that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
gig which is probably the thing that

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.069 
gig which is probably the thing that
will<00:00:47.590> be<00:00:47.710> doing<00:00:47.890> most<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.429> all<00:00:48.660> press<00:00:49.660> select

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
will be doing most of all press select

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.919 
will be doing most of all press select
and<00:00:50.320> 3<00:00:50.920> K<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.879> minute<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.300> come<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.629> here<00:00:52.839> you

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
and 3 K the minute you come to here you

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.660 
and 3 K the minute you come to here you
can<00:00:53.109> see<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.379> activity<00:00:53.949> now<00:00:54.219> we're<00:00:54.460> doing

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
can see the activity now we're doing

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.700 
can see the activity now we're doing
this<00:00:54.820> in<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> center<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.539> London<00:00:55.710> so

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
this in the center of London so

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.439 
this in the center of London so
obviously<00:00:57.219> there's<00:00:57.460> tremendous<00:00:57.670> cellular

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
obviously there's tremendous cellular

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.869 
obviously there's tremendous cellular
activity<00:00:58.989> going<00:00:59.289> on<00:00:59.410> here<00:00:59.519> the<00:01:00.519> red<00:01:00.730> is

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
activity going on here the red is

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.360 
activity going on here the red is
showing<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.539> historic<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.469> that's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
showing you the historic and that's

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.720 
showing you the historic and that's
literally<00:01:04.330> covering<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.080> peak<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:06.159> yellow

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
literally covering the peak the yellow

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.399 
literally covering the peak the yellow
is<00:01:07.000> showing<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.450> what's<00:01:07.630> actually<00:01:07.870> happening

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
is showing you what's actually happening

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.010 
is showing you what's actually happening
at<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.710> moment<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.240> come<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.750> top

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
at this moment if you come to the top

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440 
at this moment if you come to the top
here<00:01:11.490> let's<00:01:12.490> give<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.760> an<00:01:12.850> example<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
here let's give you an example of the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.830 
here let's give you an example of the
speed<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.530> going<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:15.790> is<00:01:16.540> how

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
speed that this is going that is how

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.630 
speed that this is going that is how
many<00:01:17.020> sweeps<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.680> done<00:01:17.920> in<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.400> short

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
many sweeps it's done in just a short

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.700 
many sweeps it's done in just a short
time<00:01:18.880> I've<00:01:19.120> been<00:01:19.270> speaking<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.410> it's<00:01:20.590> a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
time I've been speaking and it's a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
time I've been speaking and it's a
moment<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.870> 1,200<00:01:22.870> sweeps<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.730> already

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
moment it's 1,200 sweeps and already

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.770 
moment it's 1,200 sweeps and already
it's<00:01:24.970> now<00:01:25.470> 1,300<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.850> roughly<00:01:28.210> going

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
it's now 1,300 so that is roughly going

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.540 
it's now 1,300 so that is roughly going
across<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.640> spectrum<00:01:30.660> up<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.960> 3<00:01:32.200> gig

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
across that spectrum up to 3 gig

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.940 
across that spectrum up to 3 gig
probably<00:01:33.550> 3<00:01:33.790> or<00:01:33.820> 4<00:01:34.060> times<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.510> second<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.680> we

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
probably 3 or 4 times a second then we

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.070 
probably 3 or 4 times a second then we
go<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.400> second<00:01:39.820> item<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.540> submenu

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
go to the second item of the submenu

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.860 
go to the second item of the submenu
which<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.440> detailed<00:01:41.920> zoom<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:43.150> allows<00:01:43.540> you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
which is detailed zoom this allows you

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.970 
which is detailed zoom this allows you
to<00:01:44.560> place<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:46.000> zoom<00:01:46.630> here<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.560> complete

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
to place the zoom here of the complete

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.580 
to place the zoom here of the complete
range<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.550> you've<00:01:48.730> already<00:01:49.440> depicted<00:01:50.440> up

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
range that you've already depicted up

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.470 
range that you've already depicted up
here<00:01:50.890> for<00:01:51.460> example<00:01:51.850> at<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> moment<00:01:52.360> we're

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
here for example at the moment we're

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.080 
here for example at the moment we're
going<00:01:52.660> from<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.990> hundred<00:01:53.320> kilohertz<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.220> 20<00:01:54.640> for

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
going from a hundred kilohertz to 20 for

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.540 
going from a hundred kilohertz to 20 for
geeks'<00:01:55.360> over<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.900> whole<00:01:55.930> spectrum<00:01:56.550> but

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
geeks' over going the whole spectrum but

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.840 
geeks' over going the whole spectrum but
at<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.090> same<00:01:58.300> time<00:01:58.660> we<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.800> narrow<00:02:00.130> down<00:02:00.220> our

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
at the same time we can narrow down our

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.570 
at the same time we can narrow down our
search<00:02:01.630> by<00:02:02.350> using<00:02:02.590> this<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.190> then<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.400> can

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
search by using this and then we can

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.300 
search by using this and then we can
move<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:03.940> along<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.440> for<00:02:05.620> example<00:02:06.040> when<00:02:06.160> we

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
move this along so for example when we

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.729 
move this along so for example when we
come<00:02:06.550> here<00:02:06.940> we're<00:02:07.780> looking<00:02:07.900> at<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.259> whole<00:02:08.440> load

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
come here we're looking at a whole load

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.949 
come here we're looking at a whole load
of<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:09.369> mean<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.819> is<00:02:10.000> obviously<00:02:10.119> cellular

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
of I mean this is obviously cellular

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.440 
of I mean this is obviously cellular
frequencies<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.980> again<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.120> still<00:02:13.300> in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
frequencies and again we are still in
