00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.529
 national athletics authorities and 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.330
 international visited the stadium 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.400
 heriberto jara corona as part of the 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.110
 inspections at the technical level that each 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400
 Mexican federation is performing in 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.160
 the state heading to the games 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.380
 Central American and Caribbean 2014 has 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 surprised the great quality of 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.759
 functionality that has 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.130
 was a good stadium a nice stadium 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.980
 but it had some some shortcomings 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.270
 the heating areas that has 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 solved and has been solved of the best 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.910
 way there are very few states in the world 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 where they have that facility that the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.489
 athletes warm up and a few meters 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.470
 distance and there is the competition area 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.629
 then there are other challenges the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.370
 work facilities that have to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 have stadiums in the stadium 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 almost all of them are among the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.500
 tribunes and the floor space where there are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.780
 many offices 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
 there are work offices for the press 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 work offices for technicians 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.570
 work offices for doctors 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 for anti-doping tests to those who do not 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.720
 exist here they are going to have to adapt 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.040
 we are taking care of the environment the stadium 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 will continue to have the same 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 artistic personality that I had now 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 not only will it be a monument it will be 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.820
 a monument that works with benefit 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.020
 social because we want the paintings 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.009
 that are formed for the others 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.929
 Central Americans 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.479
 serve for athletics to be 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.689
 running every day for the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 athletics of the venue according to the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 project plans the areas of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.850
 warming will be built on what 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 today we know as the annex field and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 quirasco will expand the degraded areas 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.920
 and a parking lot will be built to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 500 cars in the grandstand area of ​​the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000
 quirasco of work in athletics 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.939
 national course to the fair the maximum 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.700
 leader says we are about two 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.189
 years of the event and I think that they are 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.530
 taking the relevant measures to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.929
 have the best games I the truth 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.330
 I am convinced that just like today 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.930
 we are sitting here talking about what 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.289
 what is the event 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.119
 the adjustments that have to be made 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.740
 and the disposition that you have is 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.170
 guaranteed the best games of the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.790
 history because the soul of all 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.180
 games is athletics then the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.640
 true if it was worrying that they were taken 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.110
 already these measures and good to two years and the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 commitment that possibly in October 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.870
 of the year that enters we are already talking about 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.180
 probably from events of the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.540
 nature of the previous games as 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.790
 to qualify them as 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.590
 federation my concern goes to a 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.680
 little wider in the sense that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.540
 I wish everyone were from Veracruz but I 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.300
 I hope that really in the 35 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 associations have an important contribution 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.680
 from the technical point of view and that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.989
 be a selection not only the biggest 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.880
 but it is the most competitive that has 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.620
 had better history the stadium 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.720
 jalapeño will suffer its modifications to 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.030
 from January 2013 and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.400
 approximately it will take 10 months in 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.270
 leave it ready for more sports 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.270
