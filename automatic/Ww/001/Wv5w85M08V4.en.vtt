 inspired by kim kashashian so I 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 fell on pictures of her she was 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.059
 a parade with his granddaughter and his 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.600

 usually on your face with my 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.080
 fingers I love to apply it with my 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 rights I find that rendering is very 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.000
 natural if you prefer to use a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.350
 brush of course go ahead I'm going next 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 use my stick from maybelline's 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.680
 the range made me agree coconut that I 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.000
 will apply so to do my 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 account or ring ie under the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 cheekbones under the jaw on the sides 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 nose on the pines higher up the forehead 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 and I'll put a little bit under it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 the lower lip for peace recessions 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 to occupy your students I will then 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 come to blur all with a brush 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 from sigma I then apply my 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.070
 anti-dark circles at home maybelline shooting 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.750
 smooth minerals in hues medium seems 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
 so on my dark circles and where I want 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 illuminated my face ie on 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 the nose between the eyebrows on the bow 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.700
 of cupid 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 I will get there and then I 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.250
 will apply a stern from home 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 maybelline still in the process of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 know this time it's the powder that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 is going to be the stick actually that I have 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 applied just before I'm going to apply 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 on top of that stick there for so that he 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390
 stay well all day long to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.189
 add a little more than two 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.680
 colors to my face I then come 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.700
 do my eyebrows and I'm going I wanted 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.170
 to make a little thicker than 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 usually because kim kardashian of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 to really very thick eyebrows and I 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.689
 really wanted this look very eyebrows 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.549
 thick so 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.750
 so that's what I did I 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.259
 think that to sting a home base 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 maybelline 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 I do not remember the color but I 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.960
 put it in info bar and get 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.619
 to deceive everything with a chebbi brush and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 cosmetics 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.450
 with this same brush I will take the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.369
 sun and saturn color from home 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.810
 galaxy chic palette from be exposed 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.259
 meetic that I'm going to apply will be any 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 my eyelid 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.120
 following with a brush a little more precise 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.560
 I will apply the color March so 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.600
 on the outer corner of the eye I'm going 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.100
 stay in fact on the simple and then 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.220
 and on the outer part of the eye 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.840
 removed I applied it roughly enough 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.360
 sorry but we'll come blured it's okay 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 really make a nice rendering in the end 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.420
 you'll see and I then spent 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.800
 the most important part for for 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.480
 that kind of make up so wanted to take 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 a fluffy brush and will come to fade 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.990
 all really I will spend the time 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.730
 that it takes but I want it to be 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.750
 really well dimmed that is not of 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.750
 demarcation between lighthouses 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.160
 I then regain color in March 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.470
 and apply it on their lower he 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.350
 staying on the outer corner always 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.210
 I take my gel liner from home 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.980
 brown bobby so with a flat brush 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.560
 beveled at home cosmetics and I 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.670
 always apply them on the corner 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 external of the eye on their he has 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.260
 lower for just to step up the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.880
 look in fact and I then faded 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.800
 with the precise brush of bh 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.500
 cosmetics I came to mind and 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.090
 so fossils and in a forceps to 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.640
 to wax is really very very 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.320
 very very useful so here I go 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.420
 then come and apply an eye created 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.530
 liner so above but possible 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.730
 really staying closest 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.770
 possible of the death line did he 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.780
 higher and that's how we'll hide 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.840
 a little bit the band the band of 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.010
 fossils here I have applied myself no 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.720
 I think that's too much said 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.459
 in this video I'm really sorry 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.260
 I have to resume the slow pace 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.370
 it stings a little mascara and I'm going 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
 to go to the lips so I'm going to take 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.989
 a lip pencil from home and drowning 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.560
 are dyed words that I come to support 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.430
 so on them on my lips 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.830
 they then take a brush a 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.030
 slightly darker in the brown tones of 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.440
 in monkeys this time I will 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.810
 really apply very slightly so 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.250
 always around the lips 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.459
 I was then faded with my 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.620
 fingers I sell this carpet that a whole 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.690
 little bit of the lip gloss leap of 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.280
 cosmetics shediac always as 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.720
 that author crush on my lips and 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.019
 I have just faded again with 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.019
 my fingers 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.650
 and as the color was a bit more 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.240
 dark as the outline of my lips I 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.070
 rebuke cry fed up by ejecting 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.030
 syfy so the outline of the lips there 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.310
 always think that the outline of 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.280
 lips according to me be darker than 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.780
 the color that but inside I 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.190
 then take a very old voters 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.450
 from gasoline always that I 'm going 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.730
 so put on the cheekbones and that 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.300
 I then applied so squarely on 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.560
 cheeks on fire 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.000
 why do I really find 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.530
 very pretty and I really think you 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.430
 is going very well we also play for 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:59.900
 for that so here is after having 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.220
 paid my black client to have a 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.780
 very very precise tip I'm going 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.640
 so apply it at the end of my stroke 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.190
 to just eyeliner for just for 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.810
 intensify it a little bit more and given 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:22.760
 a little bit more this epic's eyes at 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:24.080
 look from the past to the hairstyle that is 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.310
 really very very simple we can not 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.530
 to do simpler than that and I find 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.020
 how classy it can be 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.370
 really wear with anyone with 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.050
 any outfit in any 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.270
 what an opportunity 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.860
 so here I am going to apply a hairspray 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.820
 I do not like them very much 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.650
 time because I find that it leaves 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.360
 white results on the hair 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.370
 so to change 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.780
 so here I am just going to make sure that 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.550
 my hair is well back 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.720
 there is no that there are no small 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.700
 hair that rebel and I'm going 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.680
 so make a journey to the whirlwind 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.850
 I explained this very simple bun 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.770
 in another video if you want I 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.140
 would put the info bar I would put 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.460
 link bardin so here's people using 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.620
 an elastic to secure this little 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.180
 bun but I think it would have been 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.070
 better to use invisible I 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.110
 did not have on hand at that time 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.070
 but I think if you have them 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.480
 invisible it's a little better 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.340
 because we are sure not to see them 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.870
 so here I go get some lacquer 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.040
 again to secure the 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.570
 little hair because I have 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.490
 a lot 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.940
 and here I think we finished with 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.650
 his looks 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.330
 thank you very much for watching 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.680
 I am really sorry for all this 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.720
 absence that I left you we will be 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.770
 missed a lot there is a video that 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.520
 is coming very soon with a 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.710
 little surprise 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.940
 and here is waiting for a next 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.230
 video I really make you huge 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.230
 kisses and I tell you very quickly
