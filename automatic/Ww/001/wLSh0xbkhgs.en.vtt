00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you dark sarah and today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.049
 we will raise matt with the storm behind 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.630
 8,000 hours to give I saw the whole and cretins 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 Autistic feeders and other evil spirits 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.750
 what I got the other day is already 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.120
 completely different level 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 Well, let's start as always with a peak, I take the kaaba 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 I put mid after what next and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.380
 compiled from the curtains of the same goes the world here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.289
 so coincidence and after i have to 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 go to hardline just say this game we 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.529
 lost but just look against 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.390
 what did we lose it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 against doubles in mid if wide and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 klintsah for a sniper who is 4 minutes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 was the first level in the forest and so you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.440
 probably noticed that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.390
 pb took the curtains 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 let's see how he would do it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 did not storm did the same for cramped 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 cleanse it poured and now from that moment 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 I'm starting to get hot 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 We look at our product, it has level 4 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.170
 pumped out priscilla 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.270
 how is it so here I notice that the cord 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.219
 shouted stats after which we had a dialogue 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.760
 with the only adequate time with 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.070
 abaddon 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.899
 he said that the storm was wrong and did not swing 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 what you need okay so be with 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 who does not happen and now we squander 16 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.549
 minute geek level 10 and foot pumped up 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 already on 4 of course there are many 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.670
 tell in the storm he is but to those who 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 uses this perversion through that to them 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 need to chop off a limb itmembild too 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 perfect guy collects bladstone 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.409
 using only uluta besides he 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 plays against the guilt which will be 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.790
 collect archa fog near the river 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.830
 but who cares okay if 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 that all the problems ended simply 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 guys look at this fucking dolboyeb 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 dies after which redeems arrives 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 on all mana and fucking die again so 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.200
 live from the experience he used the ultimate 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.909
 I just put out this down in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 reminded me of one storm and old 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.270
 rollers man a year ago or a half for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.369
 I played a storm that didn't 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 used or ports and flew all 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.479
 manu creeps and antimag played against us 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.800
 who was waiting for the storm to arrive and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.500
 killed him with 1 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.630
 By the way, yes, it happened on 31 minutes 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 cords rocked snapping many pussies on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.250
 strains that initially deflates 1 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.410
 and 3 but what then can you say about the storm 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 which is pumping a binding to one having 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.890
 Level 18 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.290
 I also really liked this one 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.170
 moment just file on file yes he 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.420
 yuzay orchid arrives on a creep dies and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.250
 again redeem just pizdets not let 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 god to anyone such a team strains 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.630
 you could still write how he flew 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.910
 spontaneously on all mana in five heroes and 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.770
 then I died, but I think that perhaps 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690
 that's enough, but I haven't talked about my 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
 easy line keris 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.790
 38 minutes value is 5000 but 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.790
 the last word I give abaddon 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.690
