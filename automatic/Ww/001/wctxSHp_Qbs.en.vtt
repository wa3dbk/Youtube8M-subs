00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.649
There are some ingredients that I notice in
some DIY recipes for hair and there are some

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:16.231
that aren't going to damage hair but if not
processed properly they can be uh kind of

00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:23.199
difficult to put into hair and wash out of
hair and then there are ingredients that can

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.640
actually potentially be damaging.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.180
One of the ingredients that can be damaging
to hair is vinegar.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:39.800
Vinegar um is sometimes used to clarify hair
and if vinegar is not diluted properly, it's

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.170
not mixed into water in the proper amount
and it ends up being too acidic um depending

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.540
on like you know how it's being used or how
long it's being left in hair or how frequently

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.690
it's being used and then also depending on
how acidic the solution ends up being, like

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.920
how um too acidic it is, it can cause erosion
to hair.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.290
So it can basically eat away at hair and that
is permanent damage.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.880
A few things to consider when using vinegar
or when thinking of about using vinegar is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.091
that even if someone does have a recipe and
the recipe is supposed to be, you know, a

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.350
good recipe, different kinds of vinegar have
different pH levels.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.310
For example, white vinegar is generally more
acidic than apple cider vinegar.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.100
There are various different factors that need
to be controlled in order to get really consistent

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100
results.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.060
I'd still say even if there is a good recipe
for a vinegar and water, like a solution of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.409
vinegar and water to clarify hair I would
recommend that that solution should be tested

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.270
because of the potential damage that can happen
either short term, through short term use

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.829
or long term use depending on how acidic that
solution ends up being and you know how it's

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.159
being used and all that.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.700
So I would say be careful.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.990
Baking soda: Baking soda would be a good cleaner
for something like a porcelain bathtub or

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.719
a sink.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:20.779
Umm but hair, it's generally not, in terms
of cosmetics, an ingredient that is good for

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.220
hair because of how abrasive it is.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.189
It's um alkaline and even if it is, someone
has some sort of recipe to try to bring it

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:36.120
in to balance, you know so that it's um in
balance with hair, it's still an abrasive

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.659
and so that doesn't go away and that's problematic
for something to be abrasive going against

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.659
hair.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.129
The risk to benefit ratio when I think of
baking soda, the risk far outweighs the possible,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.730
potential, perceived benefits of using it.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.809
Umm especially since there are other ingredients
that are just as widely accessible and can

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.209
gently clean hair.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.939
So those are a couple of things, those are
two ingredients that I would say can potentially

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:12.709
cause harm, I would say baking soda is just
a definite no I mean that's just my opinion,

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.909
you know, that's just my opinion that it's
definitely a no because if the alkalinity

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.439
and the abrasiveness.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.569
I've also noticed um the use of vinegar and
baking soda, some sort of mixture or some

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.970
sort of routine and I just think that something
like vinegar, that is too acidic for hair

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.889
and skin with the potential to cause erosion
and then baking soda that is too alkaline

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:50.659
for hair and abrasive and combining them somehow
or putting them into some kind of routine,

00:03:50.659 --> 00:04:02.099
in my opinion, those are very unrefined methods
or attempts to cleanse hair.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.390
That's just my opinion and that's just looking
at risk to benefit, all the potential things

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.699
that can go wrong in terms of balancing those
ingredients and then of course the abrasiveness

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.640
of, of baking soda.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.669
I also notice sometimes people will put honey
on hair um and it has got a lot of really

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.849
good properties in it and it's a humectant.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:34.860
I would say if it is going to be applied to
hair that it be applied to wet hair so that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.370
it has water that it is drawing in.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.430
Yeah and then I am not sure if there are other,
if there are other side effects to using honey,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.680
I'm not sure if there are any others, there
could possibly be some other things that honey

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.280
may do that may no be desirable but I would
check that out just to be careful.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.169
Um non-toxic home ingredients are good for
certain things but it doesn't mean they're

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.370
good for everything and they should be applied
on everything or that they are the optimal

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:14.479
um things to, to use on certain things so
I would just say heads up on some ingredients

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:21.879
um DIY is not always harmless it can, there
can be some harm that is created um in the

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.491
use of certain ingredients if they are not
being used properly and then there are some

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.669
ingredients that shouldn't be used at all.
