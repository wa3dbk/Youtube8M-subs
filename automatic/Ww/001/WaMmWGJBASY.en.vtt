let's have our spins the children will

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.769 
let's have our spins the children will
spin<00:01:53.209> first<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.719> then<00:01:53.840> enter<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.200> chi<00:01:55.779> energy

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
spin first and then enter to chi energy

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.879 
spin first and then enter to chi energy
chi<00:01:57.319> one<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.579> looks<00:01:58.789> like<00:01:58.939> he'll<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.270> moving<00:01:59.450> on

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
chi one it looks like he'll be moving on

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.429 
chi one it looks like he'll be moving on
