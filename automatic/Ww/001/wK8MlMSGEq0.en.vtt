00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.940 
quality than the regular one
if<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.239> see<00:02:14.480> these<00:02:14.900> things<00:02:15.110> pop<00:02:15.440> off<00:02:15.650> very

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
if you can see these things pop off very

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.210 
if you can see these things pop off very
easily<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.870> guess<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.019> one<00:02:18.200> doesn't<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.709> this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
easily I guess this one doesn't is this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.410 
easily I guess this one doesn't is this
other<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.610> think<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:20.030> need<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.269> read

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
other one I think just need to read

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.830 
other one I think just need to read
glued<00:02:22.060> when<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.090> took<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.390> out<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.540> package

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
glued when I took it out of the package

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350 
glued when I took it out of the package
is<00:02:23.959> just<00:02:23.989> kind<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.349> pops<00:02:24.560> off<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.879> can<00:02:26.030> see<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
is just kind of pops off you can see the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
is just kind of pops off you can see the
connectors<00:02:26.900> there<00:02:27.220> there's<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> little

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
connectors there there's a little

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.940 
connectors there there's a little
hexagons<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.409> kind<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.650> sit<00:02:30.860> in

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
hexagons and they just kind of sit in

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.280 
hexagons and they just kind of sit in
there<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:35.180> does<00:02:35.390> stay<00:02:35.629> on<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:35.930> sleeve<00:02:36.200> it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
there but it does stay on my sleeve it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.319 
there but it does stay on my sleeve it
all<00:02:36.409> into<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.680> lumen<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:38.209> make

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
all into the lumen it just to to make

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.000 
all into the lumen it just to to make
sure<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.599> didn't<00:02:38.810> come<00:02:38.930> off<00:02:38.959> because<00:02:39.799> if<00:02:39.950> you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
sure it didn't come off because if you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.660 
sure it didn't come off because if you
glowed<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.430> not<00:02:40.610> going<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:42.489> don't<00:02:43.489> think

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
glowed it's not going to don't think

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.890 
glowed it's not going to don't think
it'll<00:02:43.819> pop<00:02:44.000> off<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.879> then<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.180> guess<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.690> can't

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
it'll pop off and then I guess you can't

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.530 
it'll pop off and then I guess you can't
clued<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.379> just<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.459> little<00:02:49.700> hexagon<00:02:50.209> shape

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
clued it's just a little hexagon shape

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.569 
clued it's just a little hexagon shape
and<00:02:51.079> let's<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.379> a<00:02:51.410> hexagon<00:02:51.829> shape<00:02:52.069> there<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
and let's get a hexagon shape there and

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.880 
and let's get a hexagon shape there and
you<00:02:52.670> turn<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.379> locks<00:02:54.620> into

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you turn it and it kind of locks into

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.979 
you turn it and it kind of locks into
place<00:02:55.099> when<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:56.000> gets<00:02:56.180> into<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:56.780> angles

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
place when it gets into the right angles

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.089 
place when it gets into the right angles
but<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.239> wings<00:03:02.450> look<00:03:02.690> good<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.920> they're

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
but the the wings look good but they're

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.550 
but the the wings look good but they're
definitely<00:03:04.730> not<00:03:05.060> as<00:03:05.269> high-quality<00:03:05.480> as<00:03:06.049> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
definitely not as high-quality as the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.660 
definitely not as high-quality as the
single<00:03:06.859> carded<00:03:07.480> dce<00:03:08.480> Seahawk<00:03:08.989> man<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.670> didn't

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
single carded dce Seahawk man I didn't

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.330 
single carded dce Seahawk man I didn't
bring<00:03:10.819> them<00:03:11.030> here<00:03:11.180> for<00:03:11.390> comparison<00:03:12.019> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
bring them here for comparison and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.380 
bring them here for comparison and
really<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> don't<00:03:13.609> know<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.849> there's<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> lot

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
really I don't know that there's a lot

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.460 
really I don't know that there's a lot
of<00:03:14.420> visual<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.790> comparing<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.940> do<00:03:17.120> because

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
of visual and comparing to do because

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.750 
of visual and comparing to do because
this<00:03:18.470> looks<00:03:18.739> really<00:03:19.010> nice<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.280> they<00:03:19.579> look

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
this it's just a softer plastic I'm just

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.939 
this it's just a softer plastic I'm just
a<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.280> bit<00:03:40.489> more<00:03:40.609> glossy<00:03:40.910> looking<00:03:41.949> so

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
a little bit more glossy looking so

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.159 
a little bit more glossy looking so
really<00:03:43.129> you<00:03:43.970> know<00:03:44.090> not<00:03:44.449> a<00:03:44.510> lot<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.720> visual

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
really you know not a lot of visual

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.960 
really you know not a lot of visual
difference<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:45.829> you<00:03:46.430> can<00:03:46.579> just<00:03:46.730> tell<00:03:46.940> when

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
difference but you can just tell when

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.089 
difference but you can just tell when
you're<00:03:47.239> holding<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.690> um<00:03:48.560> one<00:03:48.949> other

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
differences he doesn't come with all the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.930 
differences he doesn't come with all the
accessories<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.440> he<00:03:51.620> does<00:03:51.799> he<00:03:52.609> comes<00:03:52.730> with
