00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.440 
go grab it the compound effect it talks
about<00:03:40.110> somebody<00:03:40.620> pumping<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.220> water<00:03:41.460> well<00:03:41.760> so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
about somebody pumping a water well so

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.820 
about somebody pumping a water well so
you<00:03:42.510> know<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.050> pump<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.560> lever

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
you know you have to pump that lever

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.320 
you know you have to pump that lever
really<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.460> hard<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.880> really<00:03:45.090> really

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
and water is our results so people and

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.580 
and water is our results so people and
they<00:03:51.390> start<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.690> new<00:03:51.780> endeavor<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.290> they<00:03:52.350> pump

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
they start a new endeavor and they pump

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.260 
they start a new endeavor and they pump
really<00:03:52.740> hard<00:03:53.040> really<00:03:53.280> fast<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.910> they're

working hard they're sacrificing they're
you<00:03:56.190> know<00:03:56.220> they're<00:03:56.520> putting<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.910> lot<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.120> energy

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
you know they're putting a lot of energy

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880 
you know they're putting a lot of energy
and<00:03:57.570> effort<00:03:57.720> into<00:03:57.990> this<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.680> they're<00:03:58.800> not

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
and effort into this and they're not

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.560 
and effort into this and they're not
getting<00:03:59.070> any<00:03:59.280> results<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.060> form<00:04:00.270> of<00:04:00.360> water

getting any results in the form of water

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.050 
getting any results in the form of water
or<00:04:00.990> customers<00:04:01.710> or<00:04:01.740> whatever<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.580> they<00:04:02.700> give<00:04:02.880> up

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
or customers or whatever so they give up

or customers or whatever so they give up
they<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.630> fresh<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.020> they<00:04:04.170> give<00:04:04.350> up<00:04:04.530> then

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
they get fresh in they give up then

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.650 
they get fresh in they give up then
there's<00:04:05.580> another<00:04:05.820> group<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.060> people<00:04:06.270> they're

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
there's another group of people they're

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.390 
there's another group of people they're
pumping<00:04:07.080> hard<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.620> pumping<00:04:07.980> quick<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
pumping hard the pumping quick and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.950 
pumping hard the pumping quick and
they're<00:04:08.520> pumping<00:04:08.850> consistently<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.690> lever

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
they're pumping consistently that lever

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.020 
they're pumping consistently that lever
and<00:04:10.260> then<00:04:10.710> they<00:04:10.860> get<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.190> one<00:04:11.460> or<00:04:11.490> two<00:04:11.610> drops

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and then they get like one or two drops

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.180 
and then they get like one or two drops
they<00:04:12.240> get<00:04:12.360> like<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:12.870> order<00:04:13.290> they're<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.040> oh

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
they get like one order they're like oh

they get like one order they're like oh
my<00:04:14.280> gosh<00:04:14.730> I'm<00:04:14.880> working<00:04:15.210> so<00:04:15.390> hard<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.049> is

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
my gosh I'm working so hard and this is

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
then the third group of people are the

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.430 
then the third group of people are the
people<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.150> see<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.780> the

people that really see that the
magic<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.160> compound<00:04:23.670> effect<00:04:23.760> they've

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
magic of the compound effect they've

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.930 
magic of the compound effect they've
been<00:04:24.660> pumping<00:04:24.900> quick<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.530> pumping<00:04:25.890> hard<00:04:26.130> for

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
been pumping quick and pumping hard for
