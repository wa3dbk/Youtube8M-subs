straight and then I had lift it up and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.140 
straight and then I had lift it up and
it<00:02:45.300> was<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.450> wavy<00:02:45.840> wavy<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.610> was<00:02:47.730> not<00:02:47.880> fun

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
it was just wavy wavy and it was not fun

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.960 
it was just wavy wavy and it was not fun
to<00:02:48.270> work<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:49.050> serger<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.610> mean<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to work with my serger it just I mean I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.840 
to work with my serger it just I mean I
tried<00:02:51.210> everything<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> could<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
tried everything that I could and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.400 
tried everything that I could and
sometimes<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.090> serger<00:02:54.510> edge<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.900> not<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.350> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
sometimes a serger edge is not going to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.670 
sometimes a serger edge is not going to
be<00:02:55.500> appropriate<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.840> Sheerness<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
be appropriate for the the Sheerness of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.990 
be appropriate for the the Sheerness of
a<00:02:58.800> fabric<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.370> that's<00:02:59.760> why<00:02:59.940> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
a fabric I think that's why you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.870 
a fabric I think that's why you
sometimes<00:03:00.510> pay<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:01.020> for<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
sometimes pay more for like a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.090 
sometimes pay more for like a
hand-stitched<00:03:02.880> him<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.530> scarf

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
hand-stitched him on a scarf

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.940 
hand-stitched him on a scarf
now<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.360> were<00:03:06.870> successful<00:03:07.770> by

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
now here we actually were successful by

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.700 
now here we actually were successful by
using<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.460> Hemmer<00:03:08.760> foot<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.530> sewing
