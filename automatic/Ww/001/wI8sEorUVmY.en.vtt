00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
going to be eating and I don't think

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to be eating and I don't think
that's<00:01:16.409> something<00:01:16.619> he'll<00:01:16.830> ever<00:01:17.070> grow<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's something he'll ever grow out of
and<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.390> unfortunately<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.200> probably<00:01:19.439> had<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and so unfortunately he probably had to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
and so unfortunately he probably had to
fight<00:01:20.070> other<00:01:20.220> dogs<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.729> food<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> wild<00:01:21.360> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
fight other dogs for food in the wild so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.240 
fight other dogs for food in the wild so
that's<00:01:22.140> why<00:01:22.320> he<00:01:22.470> needs<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.770> separated<00:01:23.189> from

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
