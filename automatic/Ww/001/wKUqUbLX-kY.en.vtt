00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.889 
looks pretty good here I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.799> lift<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.789> main<00:01:30.030> carriage<00:01:35.899> and

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
ahead and lift up the main carriage and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.930 
ahead and lift up the main carriage and
it's<00:01:37.770> surprisingly<00:01:38.369> pretty<00:01:38.640> lightweight

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
it's surprisingly pretty lightweight

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's surprisingly pretty lightweight
which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> what's<00:01:39.720> always<00:01:39.990> nice<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.149> mean<00:01:48.300> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
which is what's always nice and I mean I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
which is what's always nice and I mean I
can<00:01:48.659> easily<00:01:48.990> lift<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.289> with<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.679> hand<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
can easily lift this with one hand it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850 
can easily lift this with one hand it
looks<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.850> probably<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.860> maybe

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
looks like it's probably about maybe

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100 
looks like it's probably about maybe
three<00:01:53.250> feet<00:01:53.429> wide<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.690> see<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> nice

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
three feet wide and you can see the nice

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
three feet wide and you can see the nice
arch<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.830> have<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.369> built<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.789> so<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
arch that you have here built in so the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.669 
arch that you have here built in so the
carriage<00:01:57.539> inside<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.170> actually<00:01:58.470> going<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
carriage inside is actually going to

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.039 
carriage inside is actually going to
slide<00:01:59.039> around<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.360> idea<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.899> it'll

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
slide around and the idea is that it'll

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.930 
slide around and the idea is that it'll
point<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> exact<00:02:02.009> spot<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.549> focus

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
point at the exact spot that you focus

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.339 
point at the exact spot that you focus
so<00:02:02.970> we'll<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.420> some<00:02:03.600> tests<00:02:03.929> on<00:02:03.989> that<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.289> a

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
so we'll do some tests on that in a

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.469 
so we'll do some tests on that in a
minute<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.220> obviously<00:02:05.849> on<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.060> bottom<00:02:06.330> here

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
minute and obviously on the bottom here

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
minute and obviously on the bottom here
there's<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.780> place<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.440> mount<00:02:07.530> your<00:02:07.709> tripod<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there's a place to mount your tripod it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
there's a place to mount your tripod it
looks<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> accommodates<00:02:09.300> several

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
looks like it accommodates several

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
looks like it accommodates several
different<00:02:10.590> threaded<00:02:11.129> bolts<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.790> should

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
different threaded bolts so that should

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
different threaded bolts so that should
be<00:02:12.239> good<00:02:12.390> no<00:02:12.540> matter<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.870> tripod<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.500> have

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
be good no matter what tripod you have

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
be good no matter what tripod you have
and<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.760> head<00:02:15.450> that's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and over here we have a head that's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.479 
and over here we have a head that's
going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.319> mount<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.709> top<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.459> looks

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
going to mount on top of this it looks

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.270 
going to mount on top of this it looks
like<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> tilt<00:02:18.540> head<00:02:18.860> really<00:02:19.860> robust

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
like this is a tilt head really robust

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
like this is a tilt head really robust
really<00:02:20.670> sturdy<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.209> really<00:02:21.510> nice<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.840> they

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
really sturdy it's really nice that they

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.449 
really sturdy it's really nice that they
give<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> don't<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
give you this so that you don't have to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.210 
give you this so that you don't have to
mix<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.879> match<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.060> other<00:02:24.360> heads<00:02:25.220> perhaps

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mix and match your other heads perhaps

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.800 
mix and match your other heads perhaps
you<00:02:26.400> could<00:02:26.580> put<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:26.879> own<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
you could put your own on there but the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.270 
you could put your own on there but the
way<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.050> looks<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.160> gonna

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
way this looks I think this is gonna

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.580 
way this looks I think this is gonna
stay<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.819> permanently<00:02:30.300> for<00:02:30.510> us<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:31.230> over

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
stay on this permanently for us and over

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.670 
stay on this permanently for us and over
here<00:02:31.950> looks<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.790> power<00:02:33.090> supply<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:34.440> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
here looks like the power supply this is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
here looks like the power supply this is
a<00:02:34.709> motorized<00:02:35.370> system<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:35.940> you're<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a motorized system so you're going to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.970 
a motorized system so you're going to
have<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.750> plug<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.470> looks<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.830> we

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
have to plug it in and it looks like we

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.610 
have to plug it in and it looks like we
have<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.340> right<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.569> unit<00:02:40.080> does<00:02:40.319> work

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
have this right here this unit does work

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.320 
have this right here this unit does work
on<00:02:40.739> battery<00:02:41.129> I'm<00:02:41.310> told<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.819> don't<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.209> if

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
on battery I'm told so I don't know if

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.780 
on battery I'm told so I don't know if
we<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.629> all<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.230> supplies<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.860> parts<00:02:44.519> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we have all of the supplies and parts to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880 
we have all of the supplies and parts to
hook<00:02:45.599> this<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> most

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
hook this up but that's the most

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.410 
hook this up but that's the most
exciting<00:02:47.250> thing<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.760> you're<00:02:47.879> not<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.330> be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
exciting thing is you're not going to be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630 
exciting thing is you're not going to be
stuck<00:02:48.690> having<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.080> plug<00:02:49.349> into<00:02:49.500> AC<00:02:49.709> power<00:02:49.920> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
stuck having to plug into AC power you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.610 
stuck having to plug into AC power you
can<00:02:50.819> run<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.780> location<00:02:52.379> with<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
can run all of this on location with a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.369 
can run all of this on location with a
very<00:02:52.950> simple<00:02:53.250> battery<00:02:53.670> pack<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.870> believe<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
very simple battery pack now believe it

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.290 
very simple battery pack now believe it
or<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.590> there's<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.099> only<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.580> thing<00:02:57.150> you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
or not there's really only one thing you

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.970 
or not there's really only one thing you
have<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.780> set<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.140> up<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.860> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
have to do to set this up and that is to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.330 
have to do to set this up and that is to
take<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.190> tilt<00:03:00.060> head<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.890> screw<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.010> into<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
take the tilt head and screw it into the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
take the tilt head and screw it into the
base<00:03:02.610> now<00:03:02.879> make<00:03:03.120> sure<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.420> take<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.840> bottom

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
base now make sure you take the bottom

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
base now make sure you take the bottom
pin<00:03:04.470> out<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.060> other

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
pin out so you can do that but other

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.870 
pin out so you can do that but other
than<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.659> mean<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.050> literally<00:03:07.440> took<00:03:07.880> 15

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
than that I mean this literally took 15

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.660 
than that I mean this literally took 15
seconds<00:03:09.240> 20<00:03:09.510> seconds<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.110> set<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.440> I'm<00:03:10.980> going

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
seconds 20 seconds to set up I'm going

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.400 
seconds 20 seconds to set up I'm going
to<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.850> ahead<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.210> power<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.840> we're<00:03:13.200> just

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
to go ahead and power this on we're just

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
to go ahead and power this on we're just
plug<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.860> power<00:03:14.010> cord<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.490> here<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.880> then

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
plug the power cord in here and then

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.540 
plug the power cord in here and then
flip<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.660> button<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:19.070> here<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> side

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
flip this button and here on the side

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.190 
flip this button and here on the side
they<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> controls<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.960> set

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
they have the controls that you can set

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.260 
they have the controls that you can set
the<00:03:22.350> speed<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.740> this<00:03:22.920> thing<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.430> now<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> don't

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
the speed of this thing so now I don't

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.760 
the speed of this thing so now I don't
know<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.050> this<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.560> is

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
know that you can see this but this is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.670 
know that you can see this but this is
the<00:03:25.920> fastest<00:03:26.550> speed<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.470> unit<00:03:28.470> moves

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the fastest speed that this unit moves

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
the fastest speed that this unit moves
which<00:03:29.010> seems<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.550> little<00:03:29.670> slow<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.150> me<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.570> I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
which seems a little slow to me but I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.330 
which seems a little slow to me but I
can<00:03:30.810> imagine<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:31.440> we<00:03:31.560> had<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.740> telephoto<00:03:32.220> lens

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
can imagine if we had a telephoto lens

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.000 
can imagine if we had a telephoto lens
on<00:03:32.730> here<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:34.110> effect<00:03:34.410> could<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.650> quite

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
on here the effect could be quite

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.830 
on here the effect could be quite
dramatic<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.120> actually<00:03:36.210> turn<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
dramatic but I can actually turn this

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.230 
dramatic but I can actually turn this
down<00:03:37.080> almost<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> snail's<00:03:38.490> pace<00:03:38.670> where<00:03:39.150> you

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
down almost to a snail's pace where you

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.810 
down almost to a snail's pace where you
would<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.450> barely<00:03:40.170> even<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.950> move<00:03:41.130> which

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
would just barely even see it move which

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.280 
would just barely even see it move which
could<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.150> very<00:03:42.330> useful<00:03:42.420> too<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.140> just

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
could be very useful too if you just

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.160 
could be very useful too if you just
want<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.530> very<00:03:43.560> subtle<00:03:44.280> effect<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.020> do<00:03:46.140> a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
want a very subtle effect I have to do a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.170 
want a very subtle effect I have to do a
little<00:03:46.410> testing<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.730> does<00:03:47.970> have

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
little testing on this but it does have

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.210 
little testing on this but it does have
a<00:03:48.210> laser<00:03:48.660> mode<00:03:49.020> here<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.470> front<00:03:49.710> you're

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
a laser mode here in the front you're

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.340 
a laser mode here in the front you're
gonna<00:03:50.280> have<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.640> use<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.240> align<00:03:51.630> your<00:03:51.840> subject

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
gonna have to use to align your subject

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.480 
gonna have to use to align your subject
so<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.770> can<00:03:52.890> guarantee<00:03:53.130> that

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
so that you can guarantee that

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.010 
so that you can guarantee that
everything's<00:03:54.150> gonna<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.480> nice<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.690> focused

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
everything's gonna be nice and focused

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.710 
everything's gonna be nice and focused
and<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.130> also<00:03:56.310> set<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> limits<00:03:57.270> on<00:03:57.480> how

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
and you can also set the limits on how

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.140 
and you can also set the limits on how
far<00:03:58.050> this<00:03:58.380> unit<00:03:58.710> will<00:03:58.860> go<00:03:58.980> left<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.430> right<00:03:59.490> so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
far this unit will go left and right so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.490 
far this unit will go left and right so
that<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.510> guarantee<00:04:00.750> everything's

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
that you can guarantee everything's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.260 
that you can guarantee everything's
gonna<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.830> nice<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.220> focused<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.820> can<00:04:03.120> actually

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
gonna be nice and focused I can actually

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.930 
gonna be nice and focused I can actually
see<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.870> lasers<00:04:04.260> being<00:04:04.560> shown<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.610> camera

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
see the lasers being shown on the camera

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.090 
see the lasers being shown on the camera
right<00:04:06.120> now<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.510> we're<00:04:07.470> gonna<00:04:07.590> take<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.920> thing

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
right now so we're gonna take this thing

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.530 
right now so we're gonna take this thing
outside<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.670> see<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:09.150> some<00:04:09.330> quick

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
outside and see if we can do some quick

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.570 
outside and see if we can do some quick
tests<00:04:09.960> we're<00:04:10.110> gonna<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.410> maybe<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.980> wide<00:04:11.280> shot

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
tests we're gonna do maybe a wide shot

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.800 
tests we're gonna do maybe a wide shot
and<00:04:11.610> then<00:04:11.880> we're<00:04:11.970> gonna<00:04:12.060> see<00:04:12.360> if<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.630> will

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
and then we're gonna see if this will

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
and then we're gonna see if this will
work<00:04:12.870> with<00:04:13.230> telephoto<00:04:13.710> and<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
work with telephoto and see what the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.210 
work with telephoto and see what the
results<00:04:15.510> are<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.810> I'm<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.620> impressed<00:04:16.950> so

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
results are like I'm really impressed so

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.920 
results are like I'm really impressed so
far<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:18.090> can<00:04:18.270> tell<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.660> thing's

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
far and I can tell you this thing's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.780 
far and I can tell you this thing's
surprisingly<00:04:19.859> quiet<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.400> don't<00:04:20.549> know<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:20.730> you

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
surprisingly quiet I don't know if you

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.580 
surprisingly quiet I don't know if you
can<00:04:20.910> hear<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.180> my<00:04:21.330> mic<00:04:23.810> but<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.990> very<00:04:25.320> very

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
can hear on my mic but it's very very

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.050 
can hear on my mic but it's very very
quiet<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.190> worried<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.730> gonna<00:04:26.880> be

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
quiet I was worried this was gonna be

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.200 
quiet I was worried this was gonna be
very<00:04:27.240> loud<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.720> potentially<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.760> know<00:04:29.790> able

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
very loud and potentially you know able

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.570 
very loud and potentially you know able
to<00:04:30.360> ruin<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.870> audio<00:04:31.200> on<00:04:31.380> our<00:04:31.470> camera<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.040> so

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
to ruin the audio on our camera so so

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.220 
to ruin the audio on our camera so so
far<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.030> good<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.330> thing<00:04:33.390> looks<00:04:33.750> really<00:04:33.840> cool

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
far so good this thing looks really cool

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.110 
far so good this thing looks really cool
let's<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:34.770> take<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.100> outside<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.669> see<00:04:35.970> how<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
let's go take it outside and see how the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.940 
let's go take it outside and see how the
footage<00:04:36.419> looks<00:04:36.660> what<00:04:37.230> we<00:04:37.350> have<00:04:37.500> out<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:37.860> on

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
footage looks what we have out here on

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.440 
footage looks what we have out here on
the<00:04:38.040> field<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.460> we<00:04:38.640> are<00:04:38.730> just<00:04:38.910> plugging<00:04:39.210> this

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the field is we are just plugging this

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.260 
the field is we are just plugging this
into<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.960> pulse<00:04:40.410> II<00:04:40.620> buff<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:41.040> vagabond<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.150> it's

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
into a pulse II buff of vagabond so it's

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.850 
into a pulse II buff of vagabond so it's
a<00:04:42.330> little<00:04:42.450> battery<00:04:42.840> system<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.380> think<00:04:43.410> it's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
a little battery system I think it's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.080 
a little battery system I think it's
like<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.040> hundred<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.430> thirty<00:04:44.550> bucks<00:04:44.820> it's

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
like a hundred and thirty bucks it's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.760 
like a hundred and thirty bucks it's
pretty<00:04:45.300> cheap<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.410> working

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
pretty cheap and this is working

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.680 
pretty cheap and this is working
flawlessly<00:04:46.919> obviously<00:04:47.910> we<00:04:48.090> have<00:04:48.180> no<00:04:48.330> idea<00:04:48.570> how

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
flawlessly obviously we have no idea how

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.720 
flawlessly obviously we have no idea how
long<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.140> gonna<00:04:49.230> work<00:04:49.500> but<00:04:49.830> right<00:04:50.610> now

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
long it's gonna work but right now

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.890 
long it's gonna work but right now
everything<00:04:51.180> looks<00:04:51.210> like<00:04:51.480> it's<00:04:51.630> going<00:04:51.870> pretty

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
everything looks like it's going pretty

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.380 
everything looks like it's going pretty
well<00:04:52.200> one<00:04:52.800> issue<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.190> we<00:04:53.340> did<00:04:53.700> have<00:04:53.910> was<00:04:54.180> we

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
well one issue that we did have was we

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.090 
well one issue that we did have was we
were<00:04:54.540> initially<00:04:54.840> mounting<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.740> entire

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
were initially mounting this entire

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.180 
were initially mounting this entire
system<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.730> top<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.630> video<00:04:58.470> head<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.100> we

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
system on top of a video head and we

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.740 
system on top of a video head and we
just<00:04:59.370> found<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.850> was<00:04:59.940> a<00:04:59.970> little<00:05:00.300> wobbly<00:05:00.540> I

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
just found that it was a little wobbly I

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.780 
just found that it was a little wobbly I
think<00:05:01.140> because<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.650> plate<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.490> what<00:05:02.669> we

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
think because of the plate so what we

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.250 
think because of the plate so what we
did<00:05:02.970> was<00:05:03.120> we<00:05:03.150> went<00:05:03.419> ahead<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.660> mounted<00:05:04.140> the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
did was we went ahead and mounted the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.290 
did was we went ahead and mounted the
whole<00:05:04.440> system<00:05:04.830> directly<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.490> our<00:05:05.580> tripod<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
whole system directly on our tripod and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300 
whole system directly on our tripod and
the<00:05:06.690> results<00:05:07.080> are<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.200> lot<00:05:07.530> more<00:05:07.560> stabilized

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the results are a lot more stabilized

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.430 
the results are a lot more stabilized
now<00:05:08.700> from<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.419> angle<00:05:09.570> right<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.260> can

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
now from this angle right here you can

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.990 
now from this angle right here you can
see<00:05:10.650> we've<00:05:10.830> mounted<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.490> whole<00:05:11.760> system

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
see we've mounted this whole system

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.300 
see we've mounted this whole system
directly<00:05:12.750> onto<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.169> top<00:05:13.350> of<00:05:13.380> our<00:05:13.620> tripod<00:05:13.860> with

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
directly onto the top of our tripod with

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.940 
directly onto the top of our tripod with
no<00:05:14.580> other<00:05:14.910> ball<00:05:15.390> head<00:05:15.600> or<00:05:15.780> moving<00:05:16.080> parts<00:05:16.410> this

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
no other ball head or moving parts this

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.590 
no other ball head or moving parts this
works<00:05:17.250> way<00:05:17.520> better<00:05:17.730> it's<00:05:17.970> much<00:05:18.150> more<00:05:18.330> sturdy

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
works way better it's much more sturdy

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.850 
works way better it's much more sturdy
and<00:05:18.930> in<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.110> case<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.470> we're<00:05:19.560> doing<00:05:19.650> right

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
and in the case that we're doing right

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.650 
and in the case that we're doing right
now<00:05:19.919> we<00:05:20.100> have<00:05:20.370> probably<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.880> heaviest<00:05:21.120> setup

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
now we have probably the heaviest setup

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.600 
now we have probably the heaviest setup
that<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:21.930> would<00:05:22.080> ever<00:05:22.260> run<00:05:22.620> on<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:23.070> system<00:05:23.460> I

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
that you would ever run on the system I

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.040 
that you would ever run on the system I
think<00:05:23.880> right<00:05:24.030> now<00:05:24.120> we're<00:05:24.330> using<00:05:24.360> about<00:05:24.990> a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
think right now we're using about a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.810 
think right now we're using about a
hundred<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.470> thirty<00:05:25.560> millimeters<00:05:26.490> we're<00:05:26.700> on

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
hundred and thirty millimeters we're on

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.200 
hundred and thirty millimeters we're on
the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.360 
the
70<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.080> 200<00:05:28.259> so<00:05:28.710> we're<00:05:28.860> zoomed<00:05:29.070> in<00:05:29.220> pretty

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
70 to 200 so we're zoomed in pretty

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.670 
70 to 200 so we're zoomed in pretty
telephoto<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.840> see<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.169> effect<00:05:31.530> is

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
telephoto and you can see the effect is

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.490 
telephoto and you can see the effect is
rather<00:05:32.100> strong<00:05:33.060> right<00:05:33.360> now<00:05:33.509> even<00:05:33.750> with<00:05:34.050> slight

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
rather strong right now even with slight

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.379 
rather strong right now even with slight
movement<00:05:35.039> right<00:05:35.370> now<00:05:35.520> we're<00:05:35.729> running<00:05:35.940> this<00:05:36.240> at

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
movement right now we're running this at

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.150 
movement right now we're running this at
the<00:05:36.509> fastest<00:05:36.990> speed<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.259> think<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.650> is<00:05:37.770> on<00:05:37.889> 9

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
the fastest speed I think this is on 9

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.770 
the fastest speed I think this is on 9
or<00:05:38.370> 10<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:38.940> this<00:05:39.090> is<00:05:39.150> probably<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.750> most

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
or 10 so this is probably the most

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.930 
or 10 so this is probably the most
dramatic<00:05:40.500> effect<00:05:40.620> you're<00:05:41.009> gonna<00:05:41.160> get<00:05:41.430> with

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
dramatic effect you're gonna get with

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.909 
dramatic effect you're gonna get with
this<00:05:42.180> setup<00:05:42.449> now<00:05:42.810> we're<00:05:43.380> gonna<00:05:43.470> change<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
this setup now we're gonna change the

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.650 
this setup now we're gonna change the
lenses<00:05:44.160> shoot<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.490> little<00:05:44.759> bit<00:05:44.880> wider<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.449> see

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
lenses shoot a little bit wider and see

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.909 
lenses shoot a little bit wider and see
if<00:05:45.750> we<00:05:45.870> can<00:05:45.960> get<00:05:46.080> something<00:05:46.259> that's<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.800> little

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
if we can get something that's a little

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.159 
if we can get something that's a little
slower<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.850> give<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.090> even<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.389> different<00:05:48.780> look

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
slower to give you even a different look

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.900 
slower to give you even a different look
so<00:05:49.770> in<00:05:49.889> this<00:05:49.979> shot<00:05:50.250> we've<00:05:50.430> gone<00:05:50.580> ahead<00:05:50.699> and

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
so in this shot we've gone ahead and

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.600 
so in this shot we've gone ahead and
changed<00:05:51.270> over<00:05:51.389> from<00:05:51.539> a<00:05:51.780> 70<00:05:52.169> to<00:05:52.289> 200<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:52.949> 24

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
changed over from a 70 to 200 to the 24

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.520 
changed over from a 70 to 200 to the 24
to<00:05:53.789> 70<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.360> believe<00:05:54.840> right<00:05:55.020> now<00:05:55.050> we're<00:05:55.350> shooting

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
to 70 I believe right now we're shooting

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.680 
to 70 I believe right now we're shooting
fairly<00:05:56.160> wide<00:05:56.340> we're<00:05:56.580> in<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.759> 30<00:05:57.030> millimeter

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
fairly wide we're in the 30 millimeter

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.629 
fairly wide we're in the 30 millimeter
range<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.320> you<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.680> see<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.130> effect<00:05:59.460> is<00:05:59.610> a

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
range and you can see the effect is a

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.909 
range and you can see the effect is a
lot<00:05:59.940> less<00:06:00.210> pronounced<00:06:00.630> than<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.990> was<00:06:01.169> on<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
lot less pronounced than it was on the

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.070 
lot less pronounced than it was on the
telephoto<00:06:02.400> lens<00:06:02.729> now<00:06:03.090> keep<00:06:03.449> in<00:06:03.599> mind<00:06:03.630> this<00:06:03.900> is

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
telephoto lens now keep in mind this is

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.900 
telephoto lens now keep in mind this is
still<00:06:04.289> set<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.710> fastest<00:06:05.280> setting<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:05.759> this

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
still set to the fastest setting so this

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.850 
still set to the fastest setting so this
is<00:06:06.030> never<00:06:06.270> gonna<00:06:06.479> be<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.720> really<00:06:07.080> dramatic<00:06:07.259> fast

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
is never gonna be a really dramatic fast

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.070 
is never gonna be a really dramatic fast
slider<00:06:08.220> this<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.669> very<00:06:08.910> subtle<00:06:09.300> but<00:06:09.599> that's

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
slider this is very subtle but that's

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.330 
slider this is very subtle but that's
really<00:06:10.349> where<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.650> can<00:06:10.800> use<00:06:10.979> this<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.310> your

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
really where you can use this to your

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.100 
really where you can use this to your
advantage<00:06:11.460> now<00:06:12.150> it's<00:06:12.360> cool<00:06:12.539> with<00:06:12.660> this<00:06:12.810> system

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
advantage now it's cool with this system

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.080 
advantage now it's cool with this system
is<00:06:13.440> it<00:06:13.590> comes<00:06:13.800> with<00:06:13.979> these<00:06:14.099> laser<00:06:14.430> beams<00:06:14.759> check

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
is it comes with these laser beams check

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.180 
is it comes with these laser beams check
this<00:06:15.210> out<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.930> will<00:06:16.110> actually<00:06:16.259> project<00:06:16.949> two

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
this out it will actually project two

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.129 
this out it will actually project two
laser<00:06:17.430> beams<00:06:17.729> and<00:06:18.000> if<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.210> line<00:06:18.509> them<00:06:18.750> up<00:06:18.900> I'm

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
laser beams and if I line them up I'm

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.960 
laser beams and if I line them up I'm
guaranteeing<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.430> camera<00:06:20.789> will<00:06:20.940> be

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
guaranteeing that the camera will be

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.029 
guaranteeing that the camera will be
properly<00:06:21.539> focused<00:06:21.900> at<00:06:22.259> all<00:06:22.289> times

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
properly focused at all times

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.920 
properly focused at all times
basically<00:06:23.490> I'm<00:06:23.759> standing<00:06:24.270> in<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.539> middle<00:06:24.810> of

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
basically I'm standing in the middle of

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.839 
basically I'm standing in the middle of
a<00:06:24.990> huge<00:06:25.169> circle<00:06:25.680> and<00:06:25.860> if<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.280> was<00:06:26.400> off<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.550> one

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
a huge circle and if I was off to one

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.939 
a huge circle and if I was off to one
side<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.479> focus<00:06:27.840> could<00:06:27.990> easily<00:06:28.229> get<00:06:28.560> off<00:06:28.710> as

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
side the focus could easily get off as

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:30.920 
side the focus could easily get off as
the<00:06:29.190> camera<00:06:29.520> travels<00:06:29.940> along<00:06:30.150> this<00:06:30.330> path<00:06:30.630> so

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
the camera travels along this path so

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.990 
the camera travels along this path so
the<00:06:31.260> lasers<00:06:31.680> are<00:06:31.830> a<00:06:31.860> really<00:06:32.280> cool<00:06:32.310> feature<00:06:32.669> and

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
the lasers are a really cool feature and

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.640 
the lasers are a really cool feature and
it's<00:06:33.330> gonna<00:06:33.449> make<00:06:33.720> focusing<00:06:34.289> and<00:06:34.470> getting

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
it's gonna make focusing and getting

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.620 
it's gonna make focusing and getting
those<00:06:34.770> perfect<00:06:35.190> shots<00:06:35.370> a<00:06:35.580> lot<00:06:35.849> easier<00:06:36.210> now

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
those perfect shots a lot easier now

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.710 
those perfect shots a lot easier now
this<00:06:36.840> entire<00:06:37.050> system<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.800> believe<00:06:37.830> is<00:06:38.310> around

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
this entire system I believe is around

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.689 
this entire system I believe is around
$1,500<00:06:39.720> which<00:06:39.900> I<00:06:40.080> find<00:06:40.560> an<00:06:40.800> incredible<00:06:41.430> value

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
$1,500 which I find an incredible value

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.700 
$1,500 which I find an incredible value
to<00:06:42.419> get<00:06:42.570> this<00:06:42.690> sort<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:42.990> production<00:06:43.440> in<00:06:43.560> most

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
to get this sort of production in most

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.430 
to get this sort of production in most
cases<00:06:44.010> can<00:06:44.940> cost<00:06:45.120> upwards<00:06:45.479> of<00:06:45.599> ten<00:06:45.870> thousand

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
cases can cost upwards of ten thousand

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.659 
cases can cost upwards of ten thousand
dollars<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:46.889> the<00:06:47.039> fact<00:06:47.250> that<00:06:47.340> this<00:06:47.490> is<00:06:47.639> a

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
dollars so the fact that this is a

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.700 
dollars so the fact that this is a
pretty<00:06:47.880> consumer<00:06:48.570> based<00:06:48.840> product<00:06:49.289> is<00:06:49.409> really

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
pretty consumer based product is really

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.490 
pretty consumer based product is really
exciting<00:06:50.900> obviously<00:06:51.900> we<00:06:52.020> need<00:06:52.169> to<00:06:52.229> come<00:06:52.380> out

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
exciting obviously we need to come out

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.719 
exciting obviously we need to come out
when<00:06:52.650> there's<00:06:52.800> more<00:06:52.979> light<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:53.460> start

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
when there's more light and start

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.129 
when there's more light and start
working<00:06:54.120> with<00:06:54.270> this<00:06:54.449> to<00:06:54.630> see<00:06:54.810> what<00:06:54.930> kind<00:06:55.110> of

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
working with this to see what kind of

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.469 
working with this to see what kind of
shots<00:06:55.380> we<00:06:55.560> can<00:06:55.710> produce<00:06:55.889> but<00:06:56.280> I<00:06:56.520> have<00:06:56.940> no<00:06:57.240> doubt

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
shots we can produce but I have no doubt

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.120 
shots we can produce but I have no doubt
that<00:06:57.539> this<00:06:57.840> is<00:06:57.990> going<00:06:58.110> to<00:06:58.199> be<00:06:58.320> a<00:06:58.349> huge<00:06:58.740> part<00:06:59.039> of

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
that this is going to be a huge part of

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.580 
that this is going to be a huge part of
all<00:06:59.250> future<00:06:59.639> f-stop<00:07:00.030> reproductions<00:07:00.659> and<00:07:00.870> I

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
all future f-stop reproductions and I

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.050 
all future f-stop reproductions and I
can't<00:07:01.979> wait<00:07:02.130> to<00:07:02.250> see<00:07:02.430> what<00:07:02.639> we<00:07:02.759> can<00:07:02.880> come<00:07:03.000> up

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
can't wait to see what we can come up

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.149 
can't wait to see what we can come up
with<00:07:03.180> with<00:07:03.509> this<00:07:03.630> setup<00:07:03.870> so<00:07:04.500> this<00:07:04.800> isn't<00:07:05.099> a

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
with with this setup so this isn't a

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:06.800 
with with this setup so this isn't a
full<00:07:05.400> review<00:07:05.820> we've<00:07:06.000> only<00:07:06.180> had<00:07:06.449> this<00:07:06.599> for<00:07:06.780> a

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
full review we've only had this for a

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.300 
full review we've only had this for a
very<00:07:06.990> short<00:07:07.110> amount<00:07:07.409> of<00:07:07.650> time<00:07:07.830> but<00:07:08.070> I<00:07:08.130> can

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
very short amount of time but I can

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.710 
very short amount of time but I can
already<00:07:08.460> tell<00:07:08.669> you<00:07:08.849> we're<00:07:09.030> extremely

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
already tell you we're extremely

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.570 
already tell you we're extremely
impressed<00:07:10.139> by<00:07:10.229> this<00:07:10.380> unit<00:07:10.800> and<00:07:10.949> if<00:07:11.400> you're<00:07:11.550> a

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
impressed by this unit and if you're a

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.100 
impressed by this unit and if you're a
videographer<00:07:11.880> I<00:07:12.360> think<00:07:12.750> this<00:07:12.930> is<00:07:13.080> a

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
videographer I think this is a

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.510 
videographer I think this is a
no-brainer<00:07:13.349> especially<00:07:14.159> for<00:07:14.340> the<00:07:14.400> price

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
no-brainer especially for the price

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.890 
no-brainer especially for the price
point<00:07:14.639> but<00:07:15.389> if<00:07:15.509> you're<00:07:15.659> a<00:07:15.690> photographer

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
point but if you're a photographer

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.350 
point but if you're a photographer
that's<00:07:16.470> dabbling<00:07:16.949> in<00:07:17.099> video<00:07:17.370> this<00:07:17.820> is<00:07:18.060> such<00:07:18.330> a

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
that's dabbling in video this is such a

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.510 
that's dabbling in video this is such a
simple<00:07:18.960> way<00:07:19.110> to<00:07:19.139> add<00:07:19.440> a<00:07:19.470> very<00:07:19.919> high<00:07:20.130> production

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
simple way to add a very high production

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.980 
simple way to add a very high production
value<00:07:20.970> to<00:07:21.000> anything<00:07:21.419> that<00:07:21.599> you're<00:07:21.780> shooting

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
value to anything that you're shooting

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.020 
value to anything that you're shooting
and<00:07:22.349> it's<00:07:22.770> gonna<00:07:22.860> make<00:07:23.130> that<00:07:23.250> transition<00:07:23.849> into

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
and it's gonna make that transition into

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.089 
and it's gonna make that transition into
video<00:07:24.389> a<00:07:24.449> lot<00:07:24.810> easier<00:07:25.169> and<00:07:25.440> your<00:07:25.530> final<00:07:25.860> output

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
video a lot easier and your final output

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.260 
video a lot easier and your final output
is<00:07:26.400> gonna<00:07:26.580> look<00:07:26.729> that<00:07:27.030> much<00:07:27.240> more

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
is gonna look that much more

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:35.510 
is gonna look that much more
professional
