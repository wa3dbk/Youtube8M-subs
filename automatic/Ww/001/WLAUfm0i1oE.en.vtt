 teach how to play with an xbox command 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:16.240
 but not in a real command but with 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.580
 its characteristics since the games 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.400

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.340
 the last ones but need a control of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.220
 xbox 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.290
 and that can be taught today how to play 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 games with a good normal command first 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.770
 what we are going to do is to go to the link what 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 I will leave in the description of this 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.400
 video and what we're going to do is go to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.400
 to download 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.580
 and here you are going to have to wait 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.580
 20 seconds balls download free 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.490
 it rises coming here what would be the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.070
 archive 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.440
 very well 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 then there would not be this file and the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.800
 new axis is to create files as it falls 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800
 here 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:15.649
 good that folder 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.840
 and here would be what we would think for 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.450
 to play 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.340
 good I am to be as a reference the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 Facai game what we are going to do is 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.299
 open the file room or if not 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:33.130
 they will get file file program 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.459
 busts farcry and good this here what 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.459
 let's do 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.409
 is to create these files 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.409
 in the folder 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.010
 they continued 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.910
 here we would have to run 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.910
 the application 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.619
 it will not be done 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.300
 to evans 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.830
 would be what is this is that I do not have 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.190
 nothing if only if you want to change the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.690
 buttons 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 and here are the sounds with hands more 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.170
 normal but if you do not have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.490
 none of these are going to do 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.270
 put any one and see if food like that 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.260
 with a non-formal xbox cord 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.920
 like the one that is everything so for example 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.280
 this one yes 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.490
 very similar of you are going to do them 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.600
 blogs are going to be given and then at 6 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.060
 and I would be 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.500
