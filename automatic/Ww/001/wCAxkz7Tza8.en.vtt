 and now I know English 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.349

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.260
 thanks for what 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 Hello good day 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.810
 I had a problem with cancer 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.740
 I had a problem with my 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.740
 console 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:08.750
 and yesterday I gave myself the bat filters and started 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.480
 spin very fast because I knew a lot and from 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.170
 Suddenly like that the disc was broken and 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.990
 then I took out hands that the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.990
 houses that were left and try 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.700
 put in warfare 3 happens the same and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.020
 I was like this putting all the games 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.210
 Until I had no more I said fuck 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.490
 console whore then called to see if 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.760
 they can fix me or something because I 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:40.020
 just spent as 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.020
 and 200 euros in games and I do not know what to do 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710
 as clear sir please 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.479
 please pp and pt 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.230
 what he wants is that he has a 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.120
 console that is the case with 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.000
 with the game more than fil 3 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.270
 the last car in gaza of three sleeves 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 four threads because he has gotten 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.800
 the games and all came out in small pieces 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 in favor of the client 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.610
 Let's see 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 I put the bat fil 3 and went out in 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.050
 small pieces and then it was getting all 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.940
 the games to see if it was the ones 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.730
 games what was wrong but I think 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.670
 that after putting all the games and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.740
 all in small pieces 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.420
 was the console then called to see 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.620
 if they can fix it for me, it's because 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 I do not have games anymore 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.490
 try to play the game so he's going to 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.630
 say if it is already broken you know this 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.530
 of this is broken into little pieces because the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.530
 console has broken it 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.010
 you play with the game and this is not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.010
 A) Yes 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.520
 correct idea 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.159
 of fire 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.769
 the console has been broken has broken the disk 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.160
 the broken and has also broken the modern 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.280
 warfare 3 that cost me 70 euros and 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.840
 also the old call of duty that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.400
 I was doing in my collection that 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.360
 Now I do not have because he has broken 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.420
 everyone 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.200
 with limited editions and everything you know me 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.200
 leave a dough 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.650
 and as the console I do not know, I put it in and 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.580
 then it will start to spin very fast and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.129
 broke it and then sound like that in plan and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.120
 then I took it out and put another CD to 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.739
 see if it was like that is that the cds had broken 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.220
 and the next one went back to breaking all 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.220
 the cds 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.940
 it came out a little smoke 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.920
 it could be the number that would be your 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:39.420
 outline to look for it 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.420
 yes but that's where it is 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.300
 and it's in the back 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.290
 is up is above bird memory 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.290
