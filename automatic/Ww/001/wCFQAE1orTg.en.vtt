with and cook with and because of the
tinies<00:00:49.140> tinies<00:00:49.170> surface<00:00:49.829> area<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
tinies tinies surface area it's going to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
tinies tinies surface area it's going to
cook<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.449> quickly<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.649> cook

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
cook very very quickly so it will cook

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
cook very very quickly so it will cook
even<00:00:53.160> faster<00:00:53.670> than<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.910> sliced<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> chopped

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
even faster than a sliced or a chopped

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.209
