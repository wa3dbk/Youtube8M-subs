first and foremost I am absolutely new
at<00:00:36.860> CryEngine<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.640> don't<00:00:37.940> expect<00:00:38.180> anything

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
at CryEngine so I don't expect anything

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.260 
at CryEngine so I don't expect anything
to<00:00:38.780> be<00:00:38.870> triple<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.440> quality<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.180> even<00:00:41.180> though

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
going to drop the resolution down a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.969 
going to drop the resolution down a
little<00:01:47.689> bit<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.990> don't<00:01:48.170> crash<00:01:48.350> my<00:01:48.560> computer

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
little bit so I don't crash my computer

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.789 
little bit so I don't crash my computer
and<00:01:49.990> let's<00:01:50.990> go<00:01:51.170> over<00:01:51.530> here<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.840> single<00:01:54.619> item

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
and let's go over here to a single item

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.270 
and let's go over here to a single item
like<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:55.610> rock<00:01:56.090> now<00:01:57.080> you'll<00:01:57.259> see<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> XY<00:01:58.009> and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
like this rock now you'll see the XY and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.999 
like this rock now you'll see the XY and
z<00:01:58.520> coordinate<00:01:59.030> bars<00:01:59.509> there<00:01:59.869> every<00:02:00.590> single

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
z coordinate bars there every single

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.069 
z coordinate bars there every single
item<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.840> separate<00:02:02.840> there's<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:04.930> collection<00:02:05.930> of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
item is separate there's a collection of

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.180 
item is separate there's a collection of
items<00:02:06.350> put<00:02:07.189> together<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.729> make<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:07.970> scene<00:02:08.329> and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
items put together to make a scene and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.930 
items put together to make a scene and
what<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:10.429> think<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> lot<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:10.850> people

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
what I don't think a lot of people

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.170 
what I don't think a lot of people
understand<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.739> number<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.549> items<00:02:13.850> it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
understand is the number of items it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.539 
understand is the number of items it
takes<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.630> create<00:02:14.989> something<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.310> that

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
takes to create something like this that

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.430 
takes to create something like this that
I<00:02:16.579> created<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.329> there's<00:02:17.720> probably<00:02:18.019> easier

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
I created now there's probably easier

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.479 
I created now there's probably easier
ways<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.910> being<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.450> professional

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
ways but not being a professional

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.970 
ways but not being a professional

whatever<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.430> would<00:02:25.519> call<00:02:25.579> that<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.299> do<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
whatever you would call that I do it the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.229 
whatever you would call that I do it the
best<00:02:27.860> way<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.190> with<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.730> pre<00:02:28.910> modeled

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
best way I can with the pre modeled

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.990 
best way I can with the pre modeled
thing<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.660> let's<00:02:29.840> look<00:02:30.140> at<00:02:30.380> what<00:02:31.310> exactly<00:02:31.430> goes

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
thing so let's look at what exactly goes

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.550 
thing so let's look at what exactly goes
into<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> hangar<00:02:32.870> each<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
into the hangar each of the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.180 
into the hangar each of the
I<00:02:36.750> guess<00:02:37.750> crosshairs<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.770> would<00:02:38.890> call<00:02:39.069> them

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
I guess crosshairs you would call them

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.180 
I guess crosshairs you would call them
the<00:02:39.250> XYZ<00:02:39.810> coordinates<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.470> separate<00:02:42.010> item

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the XYZ coordinates is a separate item

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.750 
the XYZ coordinates is a separate item
and<00:02:43.290> i'm<00:02:44.290> not<00:02:44.620> sure<00:02:44.680> if<00:02:45.040> there's<00:02:45.220> an<00:02:45.340> entity

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
and i'm not sure if there's an entity

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.280 
and i'm not sure if there's an entity
counter<00:02:46.239> where<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> could<00:02:46.630> actually<00:02:46.810> tell<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
counter where I could actually tell you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.520 
counter where I could actually tell you
exactly<00:02:47.920> how<00:02:48.010> many<00:02:48.489> pieces<00:02:49.050> go<00:02:50.050> into<00:02:50.380> making

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
exactly how many pieces go into making

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.580 
exactly how many pieces go into making
something<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.349> think

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
something like this but I have to think

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.150 
something like this but I have to think
it's<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.920> thousands<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:55.030> spent<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:56.650> can't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
it's in the thousands I spent I can't

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.470 
it's in the thousands I spent I can't
even<00:02:57.250> imagine<00:02:57.400> how<00:02:57.760> much<00:02:57.880> time<00:02:58.120> putting<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
even imagine how much time putting this

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.050 
even imagine how much time putting this
together<00:02:58.599> each<00:02:59.230> purple<00:02:59.739> box<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.580> is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
together each purple box that you see is

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.770 
together each purple box that you see is
a<00:03:01.360> separate<00:03:01.840> item<00:03:02.730> yes<00:03:03.730> they<00:03:03.880> are<00:03:03.910> pre<00:03:04.330> modeled

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
a separate item yes they are pre modeled

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.320 
a separate item yes they are pre modeled
but<00:03:05.349> they<00:03:05.500> were<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.800> modeled<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:06.550> what<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> put

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
but they were not modeled for what I put

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.690 
but they were not modeled for what I put
them<00:03:07.450> together<00:03:07.600> as<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.310> anybody<00:03:09.670> that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
them together as so for anybody that

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.860 
them together as so for anybody that
wants<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> get<00:03:10.209> into<00:03:10.360> making<00:03:10.660> these<00:03:10.720> little

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
wants to get into making these little

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.110 
wants to get into making these little
CryEngine<00:03:11.440> videos<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.000> know<00:03:13.090> this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
CryEngine videos this is you know this

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360 
CryEngine videos this is you know this
is<00:03:13.239> what<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.510> takes<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.200> go<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.590> find

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
is what it takes you have to go in find

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.920 
is what it takes you have to go in find
the<00:03:15.519> pieces<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.150> pre<00:03:16.420> modeled<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
the pieces they have pre modeled and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.520 
the pieces they have pre modeled and
figure<00:03:17.890> out<00:03:17.950> how<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.280> can<00:03:18.580> use<00:03:18.819> them<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.989> I'm

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
figure out how you can use them so I'm

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.660 
figure out how you can use them so I'm
really<00:03:23.709> hoping<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.069> gives<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.489> better

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
really hoping this gives you a better

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.120 
really hoping this gives you a better
idea<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.420> goes<00:03:25.630> into<00:03:25.959> actually<00:03:26.680> building

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
idea of what goes into actually building

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.440 
idea of what goes into actually building
a<00:03:28.080> model<00:03:29.080> or<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.319> scene<00:03:29.880> there<00:03:30.880> again<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.150> don't

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
a model or a scene there again I don't

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.870 
a model or a scene there again I don't
know<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.810> terminology<00:03:32.019> I'm<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.670> guy
