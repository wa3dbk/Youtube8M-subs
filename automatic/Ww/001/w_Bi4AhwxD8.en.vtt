00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.490 
minutes of this normal cotton wash cycle
with<00:00:07.920> the<00:00:08.010> LG<00:00:08.340> wave<00:00:08.520> force<00:00:08.820> washer<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.350> just

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
with the LG wave force washer and I just

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500 
with the LG wave force washer and I just
want<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.740> show<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.970> gets<00:00:12.120> close<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.360> the

want to show you as it gets close to the

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.359 
want to show you as it gets close to the
end<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.200> high-speed<00:00:14.010> spin

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
end here it's on this high-speed spin

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.999 
end here it's on this high-speed spin
crazy<00:00:17.369> crazy<00:00:17.759> fast<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.349> turbine<00:00:19.800> in

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
crazy crazy fast it's like a turbine in

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.180 
crazy crazy fast it's like a turbine in
there

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
there

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.310 

but<00:00:22.790> I<00:00:22.820> mean<00:00:23.120> this<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.360> pretty<00:00:23.540> much<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.780> max

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
but I mean this is pretty much the max

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.960 
but I mean this is pretty much the max
load<00:00:24.680> your<00:00:24.950> machine's<00:00:25.280> going<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.550> get<00:00:25.730> and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
load your machine's going to get and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.850 
load your machine's going to get and
it's<00:00:26.120> full<00:00:26.450> like<00:00:26.780> you<00:00:27.320> can't<00:00:27.530> really<00:00:27.650> tell

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
it's full like you can't really tell

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.050 
it's full like you can't really tell
while<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:28.190> spinning<00:00:28.520> but<00:00:28.610> this<00:00:28.790> thing<00:00:28.970> is

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
while it's spinning but this thing is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.510 
while it's spinning but this thing is
full<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.360> clothes<00:00:29.770> I'll<00:00:30.770> show<00:00:31.010> you<00:00:31.070> at<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> end

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
full of clothes I'll show you at the end

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.270 
full of clothes I'll show you at the end
here<00:00:32.020> but<00:00:33.020> it's<00:00:33.200> just<00:00:33.290> like<00:00:33.470> little<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.160> no

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
here but it's just like little to no

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.750 
here but it's just like little to no
vibration<00:00:34.820> at<00:00:34.940> all<00:00:35.090> it's<00:00:35.360> crazy<00:00:36.610> well<00:00:37.610> in<00:00:37.700> a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
vibration at all it's crazy well in a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.880 
vibration at all it's crazy well in a
couple<00:00:37.910> washers<00:00:38.450> before<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.050> nothing

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
couple washers before and nothing

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.889 
couple washers before and nothing
compares<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.520> this

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
compares to this

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.740 
compares to this
so<00:00:42.530> I'll<00:00:43.399> even<00:00:43.699> set<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:43.940> camera<00:00:44.329> down<00:00:44.539> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
so I'll even set the camera down and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.959 
so I'll even set the camera down and
show<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:45.350> how<00:00:45.649> smooth<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.070> is<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.550> mean<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.790> is

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
show you how smooth that is I mean it is

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.150 
show you how smooth that is I mean it is
vibrating<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:47.780> I'll<00:00:48.469> set<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.739> right<00:00:48.860> on<00:00:48.920> top

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
vibrating but I'll set it right on top

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.490 
vibrating but I'll set it right on top
with<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.340> washer<00:00:49.670> here

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.880 

yeah<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:55.600> that's<00:00:56.600> pretty<00:00:56.900> good<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.380> mean<00:00:57.740> it's

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
yeah so that's pretty good I mean it's

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
yeah so that's pretty good I mean it's
just<00:00:57.920> barely<00:00:58.550> barely<00:00:59.150> vibrating

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
just barely barely vibrating

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.240 
just barely barely vibrating
if<00:01:01.270> any<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.720> guys<00:01:01.870> can<00:01:02.170> do<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.860> same<00:01:03.070> on

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
if any of you guys can do the same on

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.070 
if any of you guys can do the same on
yours<00:01:03.460> I'd<00:01:03.700> love<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.030> see<00:01:04.180> that<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.630> know<00:01:04.660> and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
yours I'd love to see that you know and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.160 
yours I'd love to see that you know and
I<00:01:05.410> think<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.920> really<00:01:06.070> cool<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.960> has<00:01:07.990> a

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
I think this is really cool it has a

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.090 
I think this is really cool it has a
perfect<00:01:08.440> balance

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 

and<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.120> hear<00:01:12.300> it's<00:01:12.450> actually

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and you as you can hear it's actually

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
and you as you can hear it's actually
speeding<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:13.740> let's<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.490> into<00:01:14.700> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
speeding up more now let's get into it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.410 
speeding up more now let's get into it's
very<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.540> last<00:01:15.780> high-speed<00:01:16.380> cycle<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> let's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
very very last high-speed cycle so let's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.930 
very very last high-speed cycle so let's
watch<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.050> last<00:01:19.760> minute<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> half

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
watch it for the last minute and a half

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.580 
watch it for the last minute and a half
two<00:01:21.180> minutes<00:01:21.330> here

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
two minutes here

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.160 
two minutes here
you<00:01:23.979> watch<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.429> go<00:01:24.460> crazy

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.649 

I<00:01:30.229> want<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.009> say<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.490> RPMs<00:01:31.970> on<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.330> thing<00:01:32.509> are

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
I want to say the RPMs on this thing are

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.830 
I want to say the RPMs on this thing are
like<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:33.490> don't<00:01:34.490> know<00:01:34.580> I'd<00:01:35.210> better<00:01:35.420> not<00:01:35.630> say
