don't<00:00:28.680> hold<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.130> much<00:00:29.400> hope<00:00:31.940> improving<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
don't hold out much hope improving on a

don't hold out much hope improving on a
legend<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.570> always<00:00:34.140> tough<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:35.280> compare

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
legend is always tough just compare

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
legend is always tough just compare
rocky<00:00:35.969> six<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> original<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:37.829> veto

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
rocky six to the original but when veto

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.369 
rocky six to the original but when veto
be<00:00:38.340> brought<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> mark<00:00:39.120> two<00:00:39.329> Golf<00:00:39.660> GTI<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
be brought out the mark two Golf GTI I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
be brought out the mark two Golf GTI I
think<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.640> made<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> better<00:00:42.270> car

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
think they just about made a better car

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.729 
think they just about made a better car
than<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.899> mark<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.219> easy<00:00:44.399> job<00:00:45.739> asking

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
than the mark one not an easy job asking

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
than the mark one not an easy job asking
me<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> give<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.250> objective<00:00:47.340> view<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.149> car

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
me to give an objective view of this car

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.119 
me to give an objective view of this car
is<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> bit<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.110> asking<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> Pope<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.070> an

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is a bit like asking the Pope for an

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400 
is a bit like asking the Pope for an
objective<00:00:50.250> view<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> Catholicism<00:00:51.600> okay<00:00:52.230> I'll

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
objective view of Catholicism okay I'll

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
objective view of Catholicism okay I'll
admit<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.039> Peugeot<00:00:53.370> 205<00:00:53.670> GTI<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.570> probably

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
admit the Peugeot 205 GTI is probably

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
admit the Peugeot 205 GTI is probably
more<00:00:55.230> agile<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> mark<00:00:56.250> 1<00:00:56.399> Golf<00:00:56.670> GTI<00:00:57.000> gives

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
more agile and the mark 1 Golf GTI gives

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
more agile and the mark 1 Golf GTI gives
probably<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:57.989> feedback<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> fact

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
probably more feedback but the fact

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
probably more feedback but the fact
remains<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> best<00:01:00.750> cars<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
remains this is one of the best cars in

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.510 
remains this is one of the best cars in
existence<00:01:01.980> everyone

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
existence everyone

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.700 
existence everyone
but<00:01:04.270> before<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:04.630> take<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.230> my<00:01:05.350> mates<00:01:05.560> with

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
but before I take this to my mates with

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.380 
but before I take this to my mates with
a<00:01:05.740> performance<00:01:06.340> shop<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.820> need<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.180> set<00:01:07.360> a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
a performance shop I need to set a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.900 
a performance shop I need to set a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
benchmark time in the standard car now I

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.250 
benchmark time in the standard car now I
would<00:01:10.330> do<00:01:10.480> that<00:01:10.600> myself

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
would do that myself

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.170 
would do that myself
but<00:01:11.830> I'm<00:01:11.950> sharing<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.400> office<00:01:12.730> with<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:12.940> bloke

away<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.840> first<00:01:47.080> impression<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.920> there's<00:01:48.130> a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
away the first impression is there's a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.880 
away the first impression is there's a
lot<00:01:48.340> more<00:01:48.580> body<00:01:48.970> roll<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.570> on<00:01:49.660> modern<00:01:50.560> pop

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
lot more body roll that on modern pop
