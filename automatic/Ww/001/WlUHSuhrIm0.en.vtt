 20TH CENTURY FOX - Come on, don't wrap it up now. 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.597
 BLUE SKYE STUDIOS - Not in front of a lady. 

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:13.034
 I wish to be back in my cage with my mirror ... 

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:14.284
 ... and his little bell. 

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.028
 Bobo can't fly here. 

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.551
 Don't worry, Blue, it's in your DNA. 

00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:22.990
 And if our friends do it without feathers, how hard can it be? 

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.058
 Fun, right? 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.873
 Yeah, fun. 

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:33.221
 Flying is not what you are thinking here. 

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:35.582
 It's what you feel here. 

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.580
 And when you feel the rhythm of your heart ... 

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.121
 ... you fly. 

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.432
 - Simply. - Cool. 

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.119
 Trust, takeoff, pull. 

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:47.175
 - Come on, you can do it. - Wait! 

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:48.754
 Come on, you can do it! 

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.558
 I can handle it. I can handle it. I can handle it. I can handle it! 

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.885
 I can't fly! 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:02.916
 I'm dead? 

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:04.578
 No, we're still alive! 

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:08.965
 From the creators of the Ice Age trilogy 

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.269
 Blue, you're flying. 

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:12.618
 A bit. 

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.089
 No, no, Blue, wait! 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.053
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. 

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:24.692
 We're going to die! 

00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:49.703
 RIO 

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.851
 You didn't feel it here. 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.014
