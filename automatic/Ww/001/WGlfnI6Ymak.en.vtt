Merle<00:00:33.630> Travis<00:00:33.660> actually<00:00:34.380> played<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Merle Travis actually played if you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
Merle Travis actually played if you
watch<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> play<00:00:35.430> exceeds<00:00:35.790> quite<00:00:36.390> elaborate

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
watch and play exceeds quite elaborate

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.260 
watch and play exceeds quite elaborate
stuff<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> idea<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> having<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.850> baseline

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
stuff it's the idea of having a baseline

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
stuff it's the idea of having a baseline
usually<00:00:42.270> alternating<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.579> that's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
usually alternating and so what that's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.830 
usually alternating and so what that's
going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> mean<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.149> our<00:00:45.270> thumb<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to mean is our thumb it's going to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360 
going to mean is our thumb it's going to
be<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.050> charge<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> strings<00:00:46.680> five<00:00:46.920> four<00:00:47.340> and

Travis<00:02:28.630> picking<00:02:28.780> works<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:29.800> first<00:02:30.010> little

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
Travis picking works so our first little

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.660 
Travis picking works so our first little
pattern<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.700> learn<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.740> together<00:02:32.740> inside

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
pattern we learn is together inside

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.430 
pattern we learn is together inside
apart<00:02:34.530> inside

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.870 

now<00:02:39.440> where<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> melody<00:02:40.099> comes<00:02:40.220> from<00:02:40.430> this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.510 

I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.840> stage<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.160> able<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> do

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I think stage one is to be able to do

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.740 
I think stage one is to be able to do
this<00:02:47.670> initial<00:02:48.480> pattern<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:53.360> once<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.630> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
this initial pattern of once you get it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.540 
this initial pattern of once you get it
you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.870> make<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.380> fancy<00:02:55.800> but<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.340> is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
you can make it more fancy but this is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.620 
you can make it more fancy but this is
the<00:02:56.670> idea<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.270> before<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.540> start

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
the idea to know before you start

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.180 
the idea to know before you start
tackling<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.110> songs<00:02:58.320> like<00:03:00.830> dust<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> wind

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
tackling the songs like dust in the wind

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.040 
tackling the songs like dust in the wind
or<00:03:02.640> landslides<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.120> something<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.600> if

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
or landslides or something like that if

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.420 
or landslides or something like that if
you<00:03:04.200> learn<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.590> first<00:03:04.890> she'll<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.220> able<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you learn this first she'll be able to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
you learn this first she'll be able to
do<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.940> try<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.210> different<00:03:06.360> chords<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:09.440> go

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
do it so try out different chords you go

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.290 
do it so try out different chords you go
to<00:03:10.500> something<00:03:10.710> like<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.920> G<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.940> might<00:03:12.120> want

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
to something like a G you might want

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.580 
to something like a G you might want
your<00:03:12.420> thumb<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.720> go<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.020> sixth<00:03:13.320> string<00:03:13.380> to

your thumb to go to the sixth string to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.540 
your thumb to go to the sixth string to
the<00:03:13.620> fourth<00:03:13.920> because<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:14.310> where<00:03:14.430> your

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
the fourth because that's where your

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.650 
the fourth because that's where your
route<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:15.080> everything<00:03:16.080> else<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.380> say<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> same
