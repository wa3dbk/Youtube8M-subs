got a good picture with must show you
guys<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> end<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.370> see<00:02:02.520> people

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
guys at the end here so I see people

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.550 
guys at the end here so I see people
take<00:02:02.820> care<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> AC<00:02:03.330> system<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.170> filled<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
take care of AC system I filled that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.500 
take care of AC system I filled that
back<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.670> pressure<00:02:05.970> spec<00:02:06.330> on

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
back up to the right pressure spec on

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.480 
back up to the right pressure spec on
there<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.170> took<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.590> whole<00:02:07.620> frigging<00:02:08.100> panels

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
there it took the whole frigging panels

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.120 
there it took the whole frigging panels
20<00:02:08.820> ounce<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.290> really<00:02:10.500> low<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.800> i<00:02:10.950> told

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
20 ounce can so you really low so i told

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
20 ounce can so you really low so i told
to<00:02:11.250> watch<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.730> any<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.330> leaks<00:02:12.600> him

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to watch out for any kind of leaks him

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.780 
to watch out for any kind of leaks him
there<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.320> don't<00:02:13.860> think<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.160> annoying<00:02:14.430> right

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
there I don't think it's annoying right

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.640 
there I don't think it's annoying right
now<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.480> change<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> out<00:02:15.990> accumulator<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
now if you change it out accumulator and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.370 
now if you change it out accumulator and
stuff<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:18.240> did<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.870> charged<00:02:19.200> up

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
stuff like that I did get a charged up

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.230 
stuff like that I did get a charged up
with<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.620> candy<00:02:19.980> had<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.310> hand<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.060> gauge

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
with the candy had on hand and the gauge

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600 
with the candy had on hand and the gauge
system<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.350> kind<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.100> explain<00:02:23.490> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
system and I kind of you know explain to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.130 
system and I kind of you know explain to
him<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> future<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> gave<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> little

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
him for the future to I gave a little

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.610 
him for the future to I gave a little
lesson<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.030> say<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.240> demonstration<00:02:28.170> of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
lesson I got you say a demonstration of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.330 
lesson I got you say a demonstration of
how<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> use<00:02:29.820> those<00:02:30.030> cans<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> fill

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
how to use those cans and how to fill

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.949 
how to use those cans and how to fill
them<00:02:32.520> based<00:02:32.820> off<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> pressure<00:02:33.840> on

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
them based off just on the pressure on

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.730 
them based off just on the pressure on
there

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
there

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.620 
there
so<00:02:35.460> like<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.760> said<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.970> wish<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.300> would<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.480> got

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
so like I said I wish it would have got

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.870 
so like I said I wish it would have got
that<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.170> film<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.370> do<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
that on film but I can we do that in the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.270 
that on film but I can we do that in the
future<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.330> any<00:02:39.480> vehicle<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.830> he<00:02:40.920> knows<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
future in any vehicle so he knows in the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000 
future in any vehicle so he knows in the
future<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.940> look<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.830> while<00:02:43.830> while

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
future what to look for and while while

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.970 
future what to look for and while while
the<00:02:44.100> vehicles<00:02:44.460> running<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.300> show<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.750> how

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the vehicles running and show them how

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.230 
the vehicles running and show them how
when<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> compressor<00:02:47.340> comes<00:02:47.490> on<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.940> drops

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
when the compressor comes on it is drops

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.560 
when the compressor comes on it is drops
way<00:02:48.480> down<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.620> 27<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.520> most<00:02:50.790> low<00:02:51.090> cycling

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
way down to 27 the most low cycling

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.260 
way down to 27 the most low cycling
switch<00:02:51.810> pubs<00:02:52.230> ops<00:02:52.440> let's<00:02:53.190> back<00:02:53.460> up<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.700> 48<00:02:54.120> or

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
switch pubs ops let's back up to 48 or

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.290 
switch pubs ops let's back up to 48 or
so<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.930> back<00:02:55.230> down<00:02:55.470> back<00:02:55.680> down<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.070> down

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
so and back down back down up and down

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.580 
so and back down back down up and down
that's<00:02:57.300> not<00:02:57.570> right<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.840> means<00:02:58.110> there's<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
that's not right that means there's the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560 
that's not right that means there's the
low<00:02:58.890> pressure<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.490> suspicious<00:03:00.060> sucking<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
low pressure and suspicious sucking it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.270 
low pressure and suspicious sucking it
down<00:03:00.720> really<00:03:00.930> fast<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.590> course<00:03:01.830> kicking<00:03:02.160> off

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
down really fast the course kicking off

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
down really fast the course kicking off
like<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.000> supposed<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.940> got<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> AC

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
like it's supposed to so we got the AC

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
like it's supposed to so we got the AC
working<00:03:07.050> form<00:03:07.350> again<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:08.490> terior<00:03:08.850> likes

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
working form again and then terior likes

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
working form again and then terior likes
working<00:03:09.630> for<00:03:10.050> him<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.410> was<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.190> major

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
working for him and that was the major

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.390 
working for him and that was the major
concerns<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.330> he<00:03:12.420> had<00:03:12.720> his<00:03:13.380> vehicle<00:03:13.890> he<00:03:14.310> has

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
concerns that he had his vehicle he has

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
a lot of all the work that he's done in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.240 
a lot of all the work that he's done in
that<00:03:15.990> vehicle<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.590> he<00:03:16.650> wants<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.890> do<00:03:16.980> some<00:03:17.190> of

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
that vehicle but he wants to do some of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.940 
that vehicle but he wants to do some of
himself<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:18.090> easier<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:19.560> some<00:03:19.740> of<00:03:19.860> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
know everything about it so it gets it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.340 
know everything about it so it gets it
gets<00:03:26.430> complicated<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.630> start<00:03:27.930> guessing

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
gets complicated here you start guessing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.830 
gets complicated here you start guessing

problem<00:04:07.880> at<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.120> problem<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:10.330> it's

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
problem at the problem so it's

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.040 
problem at the problem so it's
definitely<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:12.100> lesson<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.490> learned<00:04:13.990> what

audio stuff like that so we're getting a

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.910 
audio stuff like that so we're getting a
few<00:04:31.310> things<00:04:31.370> fine<00:04:31.790> tune<00:04:32.260> none<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.440> jobs<00:04:33.710> i
