I<00:00:00.120> suppose<00:00:00.659> there<00:00:00.840> are<00:00:00.870> some<00:00:00.960> photography

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I suppose there are some photography

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.280 
I suppose there are some photography
courses<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.730> Britain<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:04.100> abroad<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.850> are

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
courses in Britain and abroad that are

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.150 
courses in Britain and abroad that are
fairly<00:00:07.790> prescriptive<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:09.420> given

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
fairly prescriptive you're given

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.640 
fairly prescriptive you're given
specific<00:00:11.160> kinds<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.880> training<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.990> specific

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
specific kinds of training for specific

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.050 
specific kinds of training for specific
kinds<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.519> job<00:00:15.350> we're<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
kinds of job we're not like that

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
kinds of job we're not like that
we<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:20.990> open-ended<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:24.080> expansive<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.710> on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we are open-ended to expansive and so on

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.429 
we are open-ended to expansive and so on
and<00:00:26.539> this<00:00:27.920> results<00:00:29.269> ideally<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.480> graduates

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and this results ideally in graduates

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.160 
and this results ideally in graduates
who<00:00:31.740> could<00:00:32.780> work<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> whole<00:00:34.410> range<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.010> jobs

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
who could work in a whole range of jobs

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.360 
who could work in a whole range of jobs
when<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.350> applying<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.710> photography

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
when I was applying for photography

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
when I was applying for photography
there<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.120> few<00:00:39.420> places<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.809> particular

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
there was a few places in particular

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.680 
there was a few places in particular
that<00:00:40.620> were<00:00:40.770> said<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.270> best

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that were said to be the best

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
that were said to be the best
photography<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.100> promoted<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
photography and this was promoted as the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.350 
photography and this was promoted as the
one<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.500> student<00:00:47.309> who<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
one for a student who has come from a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.549 
one for a student who has come from a
fine<00:00:48.570> art<00:00:48.780> background

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
fine art background

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.049 
fine art background
it<00:00:49.680> hasn't<00:00:49.920> studied<00:00:50.250> photography<00:00:51.829> previously

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
it hasn't studied photography previously

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
it hasn't studied photography previously
so<00:00:54.059> he<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.390> safe<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.989> come<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.590> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so he was just safe to come here and you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.049 
so he was just safe to come here and you
will<00:00:55.739> learn<00:00:55.829> everything<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.280> scratch<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
will learn everything from scratch and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
will learn everything from scratch and
it<00:00:57.180> believed<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> very<00:00:58.140> standard<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.600> suppose

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it believed a very standard I suppose

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.470 
it believed a very standard I suppose
one<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:01.949> looking<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
one thing that we're really looking for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.929 
one thing that we're really looking for
is<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.880> creative<00:01:05.880> individuals<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.960> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
is a creative individuals but be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.929 
is a creative individuals but be
individuals<00:01:08.939> who<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.830> autonomous

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
individuals who can be autonomous

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
individuals who can be autonomous
learners<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.700> important

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
learners that that's a really important

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
learners that that's a really important
dimension<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> course<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.759> perhaps<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
dimension of the course and perhaps the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
dimension of the course and perhaps the
course<00:01:18.240> isn't<00:01:18.450> suitable<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:21.080> student<00:01:22.080> who

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
course isn't suitable for a student who

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
course isn't suitable for a student who
wants<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.070> told<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> time

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
wants to be told what to do all the time

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.109 
wants to be told what to do all the time
I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> university<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.909> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I think because the university is so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.690 
I think because the university is so
small<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> courses<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.860> interlink<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
small all of the courses do interlink I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
small all of the courses do interlink I

there's quite a good and community
between<00:01:36.750> safe<00:01:37.229> fashion<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.979> photography

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
between safe fashion and photography

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
between safe fashion and photography
they<00:01:39.060> often<00:01:39.479> ask<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.409> photographer's<00:01:40.860> to
