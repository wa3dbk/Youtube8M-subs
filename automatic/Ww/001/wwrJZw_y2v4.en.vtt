engine actually starts spinning and your

again burn on back below 40 and get the

again burn on back below 40 and get the

commute<00:01:09.050> now<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:09.710> let's<00:01:09.980> take<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.159> look<00:01:10.310> how<00:01:10.460> we

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
commute now so let's take a look how we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.220 
commute now so let's take a look how we
finished<00:01:11.090> up<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.770> if<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:13.340> there<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.990> last

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
finished up so if you see there the last

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.020 
finished up so if you see there the last
little<00:01:15.409> rapport<00:01:15.890> we<00:01:16.220> dipped<00:01:16.490> down<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.850> above

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
little rapport we dipped down to above

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.210 
little rapport we dipped down to above
50<00:01:17.300> miles<00:01:17.480> per<00:01:17.690> gallon<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.230> that<00:01:18.920> segment

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
50 miles per gallon in that segment

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.550 
50 miles per gallon in that segment
after<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.670> lost<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.450> all<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.350> didn't

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
after I lost that all the that didn't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.870 
after I lost that all the that didn't
lose<00:01:21.680> all<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.979> charge<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.400> battery<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:22.760> I

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
lose all the charge in the battery but I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.810 
lose all the charge in the battery but I
had<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.680> charge<00:01:24.979> down<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.490> point<00:01:25.760> where

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
had the charge down to a point where

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.730 
had the charge down to a point where
this<00:01:26.270> car<00:01:26.510> was<00:01:26.600> similar<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.050> standard<00:01:27.380> Prius

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
this car was similar to a standard Prius

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250 
this car was similar to a standard Prius
so<00:01:28.040> only<00:01:28.790> about<00:01:28.909> 50<00:01:29.270> miles<00:01:29.420> per<00:01:29.600> gallon<00:01:29.810> also

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
so only about 50 miles per gallon also

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.200 
so only about 50 miles per gallon also
there<00:01:30.380> are<00:01:30.409> some<00:01:30.560> hills<00:01:30.770> involved<00:01:31.250> there<00:01:31.490> then

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
there are some hills involved there then

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
there are some hills involved there then
got<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.630> kind<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.930> flat<00:01:33.170> section<00:01:33.770> getting<00:01:34.159> so

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
got to kind of a flat section getting so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.130 
got to kind of a flat section getting so
the<00:01:34.759> mileage<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.450> got<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.719> back<00:01:35.899> up<00:01:36.049> to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the mileage that got it back up to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.440 
the mileage that got it back up to
around<00:01:36.259> 60<00:01:36.619> 65<00:01:36.920> miles<00:01:37.189> per<00:01:37.310> gallon<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.240> last

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
around 60 65 miles per gallon the last

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.240 
around 60 65 miles per gallon the last
segment<00:01:38.780> was<00:01:39.259> pretty<00:01:39.500> much<00:01:39.560> down<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.009> hill

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
segment was pretty much down the hill

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.420 
segment was pretty much down the hill
got<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> lot<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.270> charge<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.869> can<00:01:41.990> see<00:01:42.430> little

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
got a lot of charge you can see little

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.450 
got a lot of charge you can see little
charge<00:01:43.759> cards<00:01:44.390> cars<00:01:44.960> down<00:01:45.289> there<00:01:45.320> got<00:01:46.250> enough

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
charge cards cars down there got enough

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.310 
charge cards cars down there got enough
charge<00:01:46.729> back<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.600> actually<00:01:47.930> got<00:01:48.049> enough

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
charge back up that actually got enough

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.190 
charge back up that actually got enough
that<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.649> was<00:01:48.920> able<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.219> put<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.180> car<00:01:50.360> into<00:01:50.570> EV

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that I was able to put the car into EV

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.399 
that I was able to put the car into EV
mode<00:01:51.469> as<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:52.340> was<00:01:52.520> coming<00:01:52.939> downhill<00:01:53.409> everybody

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
mode as I was coming downhill everybody

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.779 
mode as I was coming downhill everybody
went<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.560> had<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.979> there's<00:01:55.340> enough<00:01:55.520> traffic

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
went to had to there's enough traffic

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.120 
went to had to there's enough traffic
and<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.180> speed<00:01:56.899> was<00:01:57.020> below<00:01:57.229> 35<00:01:57.500> miles<00:01:57.829> per<00:01:57.950> hour

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
and a speed was below 35 miles per hour

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.310 
and a speed was below 35 miles per hour
so<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.549> last<00:01:58.789> little<00:01:59.000> segment<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.020> shows

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
so this last little segment that shows

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.200 
so this last little segment that shows
nothing<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:01.009> because<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.460> five<00:02:01.969> minutes

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
