the euro yeah if you're in get out I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.540 
the euro yeah if you're in get out I
think<00:05:20.050> what's<00:05:20.289> happening<00:05:20.650> in<00:05:20.800> Cyprus<00:05:21.280> is

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
think what's happening in Cyprus is

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.879 
think what's happening in Cyprus is
another<00:05:22.090> step<00:05:22.479> towards<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.229> breakup<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.830> the

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
another step towards the breakup of the

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.129 
another step towards the breakup of the
euro<00:05:24.250> as<00:05:24.610> we<00:05:25.060> know<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.600> think<00:05:25.870> that's<00:05:25.990> what<00:05:26.110> I

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
euro as we know it I think that's what I

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.689 
euro as we know it I think that's what I
think<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.590> think<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:27.039> is<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.220> there's<00:05:27.490> some

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
think I think so is that there's some

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.330 
think I think so is that there's some
political<00:05:28.479> party<00:05:28.870> starting<00:05:29.289> in<00:05:29.410> Berlin<00:05:30.190> of

happens the government and Cyprus goes

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.879 
happens the government and Cyprus goes
along<00:05:49.840> with<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.320> people<00:05:50.620> throw<00:05:50.770> the

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889

government and Cyprus out it's a
parliamentary<00:05:52.690> system<00:05:53.099> I<00:05:54.099> think<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:54.880> euros

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
parliamentary system I think the euros

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.330 
parliamentary system I think the euros
days<00:05:55.450> are<00:05:55.720> numbered<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.500> like<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:56.919> sum<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.280> up

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
days are numbered that like I sum it up

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.680
