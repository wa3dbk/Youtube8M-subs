as<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.100> took<00:02:38.160> old<00:02:38.459> screwdriver<00:02:38.730> handle<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.450> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
as I took old screwdriver handle and I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.590 
as I took old screwdriver handle and I
have<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> hex<00:02:40.230> drive<00:02:40.790> inserted<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.910> here<00:02:42.120> and

have a hex drive inserted in here and
what<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.840> does<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.830> allows<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:46.230> easily

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
what that does is allows this to easily

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.150 
what that does is allows this to easily

you know on a flat surface here if you

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.800 
you know on a flat surface here if you
take<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:16.430> out<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:16.729> get<00:05:17.120> uneven<00:05:17.450> pressure

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
take this out you get uneven pressure

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.930 
take this out you get uneven pressure
and<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.200> can<00:05:18.350> rock<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.740> tools<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.370> I<00:05:19.610> would

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
and you can rock to tools so I would

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120 
and you can rock to tools so I would
leave<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.720> ejector<00:05:21.139> plates<00:05:21.410> in<00:05:21.650> them<00:05:21.770> when

screw<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:52.660> rock<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:55.190> way<00:05:55.370> we<00:05:55.610> would<00:05:55.789> do<00:05:55.940> this

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
screw it I rock the way we would do this

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.020 
screw it I rock the way we would do this
is<00:05:56.570> we<00:05:56.870> would<00:05:57.169> put<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> barrel<00:05:58.250> over<00:05:58.669> top<00:05:59.000> the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
is we would put the barrel over top the

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.800 
is we would put the barrel over top the
rod<00:06:00.310> thread<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.460> in<00:06:01.580> here

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
rod thread it in here

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.860 
rod thread it in here
and<00:06:03.770> then<00:06:03.920> you<00:06:04.220> would<00:06:07.210> work<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.540> him<00:06:08.720> just

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
and then you would work the to him just

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.650 
and then you would work the to him just
like<00:06:09.080> you<00:06:09.230> would<00:06:10.000> did<00:06:11.000> on<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.210> revolver

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.550 
route what I would do is heat treat this
at<00:07:13.970> a<00:07:14.000> minimum<00:07:14.450> color<00:07:14.750> case-hardened<00:07:15.350> because

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
at a minimum color case-hardened because

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.680 
at a minimum color case-hardened because
this<00:07:16.550> needs<00:07:16.820> to<00:07:16.880> be<00:07:16.940> harder<00:07:17.360> than<00:07:17.390> whatever

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
this needs to be harder than whatever

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.010 
this needs to be harder than whatever
