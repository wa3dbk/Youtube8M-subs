to do now is write down any one of these

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.970 
to do now is write down any one of these
numbers<00:00:23.820> 2<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:25.320> 9<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> piece<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> paper

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
numbers 2 through 9 on a piece of paper

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
numbers 2 through 9 on a piece of paper
okay<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.369> multiply<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.150> number<00:00:30.510> by<00:00:30.840> 2<00:00:32.930> okay

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
okay now multiply that number by 2 okay

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.430 
okay now multiply that number by 2 okay
now<00:00:34.350> add<00:00:34.620> 5<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> number<00:00:38.899> okay<00:00:39.930> now

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
now add 5 to the number okay now

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400 
now add 5 to the number okay now
multiply<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.520> number<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.660> by
