00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.370
 this opportunity we are going to review the pot 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:26.190
 The brand's paint is lic 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:30.500
 It is 1420 this Sunday on voting 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.200
 I already apply the lipstick more or less 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.150
 couple of hours will be about two more hours or 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.870
 minus two hours twenty clear two hours 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.449
 twenty such fire 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.270
 but I'm going to tell you, I'm going to put 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.610
 the video of the application and all that is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 super nice the product 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.079
 i 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.620
 all right 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.970
 but let's start so we start 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.930
 for good packaging come in these 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.210
 plastic containers these do not reach 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 to be applicators this is a dispenser 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.090
 it's not an applicator this thought is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.729
 product to be used with brush and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 it works regal the truth that way and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.200
 brush uses a common plane nothing 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.160
 another world that you're like this generic 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 god and you des and it worked perfect runs 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.600
 very easy 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.600
 and with a lot of anger on the lips 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.290
 and feeding is such a thing but 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.350
 spectacular but I'm going to start 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.440
 tell of that in a few seconds ok 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.950
 comes then in this presentation of 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.700
 plastic the content is I tell them 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.350
 immediately they are another ml what is a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 large quantity of product for a 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.130
 product that is intended to be used in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.250

 but beautiful beautiful beautiful for the tones 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.520
 cold sub cold skin tones is a tone 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.990
 but flattering and now I owe 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.580

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.500
 name that by the color or had already 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.080

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.080
 machine gives my belongings 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.810
 a few watts within the variety of everything 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.510

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.300
 to play a lot with the tones what 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.270
 I meet but the most playful entertaining 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.180
 and beautiful that there 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.180
 there is I want you to see how 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.870
 the product did is crazy woman 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.870
 this is but something else 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.160
 how far could I go with this 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.160
 how far could I go 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.519
 you can build it while more times 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.129
 you go through the same place 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.599
 the tone is taking more and more color hey 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.129
 shine these ridiculous lower your hand 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.240
 all painted you saw your fire 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.920
 a droplet 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.940
 unusual this product I'm fascinated 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.490
 in fact I already ordered more at this level 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.550
 ok as the minutes pass 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.200
 I can notice how the product is going 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.720
 placing more dense as it goes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.570
 drying and acquiring a texture 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.940
 much more dense as I told you run 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.350
 excellent lips what does have a 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.810
 little the teeth have to have the eye 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.330
 with that to take the precaution of taking 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.209
 a handkerchief and put it in the part 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.459
 internal and remove it so that it does not 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.450
 it is tinted in the teeth although precious 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.660
 I see them then in a little while for a 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.700
 update of this test and tradition 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.790
 ok ladies update are the 1543 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.220
 pm 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.250
 I already had lunch and the one with my teeth 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.250
 can see the color is effectively going 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.010
 Now I want to tell you that in 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.320
 extremes always as we have seen what 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.800
 it happens with all the lipsticks I want 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 tell them that unlike the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.910
 new Yankees or other lipsticks that 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.150
 we have seen this is how messi 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.800
 it is like 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.560
 let her have the running service 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:57.380
 stain the glass or stain the cups and 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.950
 happens to take my hand stain then 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.950
 watch 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.470
 or think about giving kiss or anything with this I'm going 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.150
 to leave until each test reissue not 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.430
 because it produces bad but because in 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.140
 I really do not have much else to show 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.880
 what the product does throughout the 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.370
 day because it is also not a product of 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.260
 long - term if you tell them what my 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.660
 appreciation in this respect is that I find 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.280
 which is a spectacular product and in 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.960
 question as playful and entertaining as 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.180
 there is the theme of cantabria of color and that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.840
 you can mix now I find that 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.940
 for clear spectacular photography 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.640
 Take out a couple of photos that kind of 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.330
 things but like in the day to day 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.250
 I truly find worthy no no no no no 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.050
 neither is not a precious everything 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.850
 you leave wonderful who what I tell them 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.340
 is to give kisses is seized all the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.470
 world when you greet someone 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.440
 If they want , they can pass it there without wanting to 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.050
 they're going to kill him in the back of a bit 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.510
 disastrous for the day to day stain 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.900
 much more than the common labials 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.390
 that's notorious if it takes a texture 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.960
 a little more dense stain a lot more than 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.380
 the rest 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.069
 of the labials is a cream pigment 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.280
 a very powerful thing what is this post 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.770
 paint say but it's wonderful my 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.419
 recommendation is that for photography what 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.009
 meeting but spectacular but for the 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.550
 day by day I find it a little 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.550
 disastrous 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.880
 that that now they want 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.090
 risk or go to the psychologist in this 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.090
 minute 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:42.750
 what are the dating rules but in 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.490
 Seriously beautiful is an excellent excellent 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.690
 product I'm going to buy the others 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.780
 with which I'm missing because it cost me 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.210
 wonderful and 100% recommended but the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.510
 exception and those are already warned me 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:58.530
 I already told you how is this is blanket 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:01.590
 blanket everywhere throughout the pot 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.270
 reversed the famous by pain good 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.060
 I hope you have been 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.790
 useful this slip review and I see them 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.740
 in a next test review remember 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.590
 leave me a message on my wall 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.480
 facebook telling me what product you 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.700

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.560
 a new test and review remember 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.970
 Follow me on Instagram and a giant kiss 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.970
