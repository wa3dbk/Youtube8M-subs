00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.570 

now<00:00:02.110> remember<00:00:02.800> I<00:00:02.830> don't<00:00:02.950> want<00:00:03.250> too<00:00:03.430> much

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.580 
now remember I don't want too much

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.310 
now remember I don't want too much
graphite<00:00:04.120> I'm<00:00:04.359> just<00:00:04.600> experimenting<00:00:05.110> with

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.320 
graphite I'm just experimenting with

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.230 
graphite I'm just experimenting with
this<00:00:05.470> if<00:00:05.770> I<00:00:06.040> had<00:00:06.220> to<00:00:06.370> lighten<00:00:06.580> up<00:00:06.730> the<00:00:06.850> graphite

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
this if I had to lighten up the graphite

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.390 
this if I had to lighten up the graphite
I<00:00:07.299> could<00:00:07.630> tap<00:00:07.779> some<00:00:08.019> of<00:00:08.139> it<00:00:08.230> off<00:00:08.380> and<00:00:08.620> use<00:00:09.129> more

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
I could tap some of it off and use more

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.209 
I could tap some of it off and use more
of<00:00:09.459> the<00:00:09.549> brown<00:00:10.049> or<00:00:11.049> whatever<00:00:11.679> is<00:00:11.799> going<00:00:12.039> to

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
of the brown or whatever is going to

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.739 
of the brown or whatever is going to
accomplish<00:00:12.730> it<00:00:12.909> I<00:00:13.059> don't<00:00:13.269> want<00:00:13.449> there<00:00:13.599> to<00:00:13.629> be

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:13.749 
accomplish it I don't want there to be

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.049 
accomplish it I don't want there to be
some<00:00:14.019> gaudy<00:00:14.259> color<00:00:14.650> in<00:00:14.889> there<00:00:15.129> unless<00:00:15.820> you're

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
some gaudy color in there unless you're

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.020 
some gaudy color in there unless you're
doing<00:00:16.360> some<00:00:16.570> stylized<00:00:17.170> thing<00:00:17.500> in

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
doing some stylized thing in

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:31.170 
doing some stylized thing in
interpretation<00:00:20.520> take<00:00:21.520> this<00:00:21.670> around<00:00:21.970> now<00:00:30.180> okay

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
interpretation take this around now okay

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.709 
interpretation take this around now okay
I'm<00:00:31.539> going<00:00:31.780> to<00:00:31.930> integrate<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:33.480> brown<00:00:34.480> in

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
I'm going to integrate the brown in

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.009 
I'm going to integrate the brown in
there<00:00:34.839> a<00:00:34.899> little<00:00:34.989> bit<00:00:35.140> warm<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.620> up<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:37.030> make

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
there a little bit warm it up and make

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.479 
there a little bit warm it up and make
sure<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.260> we<00:00:38.530> don't<00:00:38.739> just<00:00:38.920> have<00:00:39.039> something

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
sure that we don't just have something

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.389 
sure that we don't just have something
that<00:00:39.899> looks<00:00:40.899> like<00:00:41.019> it's<00:00:41.409> out<00:00:41.589> of<00:00:41.620> place<00:00:42.039> by

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
that looks like it's out of place by

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.049 
that looks like it's out of place by
having<00:00:42.760> graphite<00:00:43.390> come<00:00:43.690> up<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:45.059> sudden

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
having graphite come up to a sudden

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.829 
having graphite come up to a sudden
change<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.780> brown<00:00:48.089> so<00:00:49.089> I'm<00:00:49.239> warming<00:00:49.719> up<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
change to brown so I'm warming up the

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.259 
change to brown so I'm warming up the
graphite<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.519> don't<00:00:51.579> want<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:51.940> bring<00:00:52.120> the

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
graphite and I don't want to bring the

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.629 
graphite and I don't want to bring the
graphite<00:00:52.659> out<00:00:52.899> too<00:00:53.079> far<00:00:53.319> I<00:00:53.379> want<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.979> make<00:00:54.609> sure

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
graphite out too far I want to make sure

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.729 
graphite out too far I want to make sure
and<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.749> just<00:00:55.899> my<00:00:56.050> experiment<00:00:56.530> right<00:00:56.679> now

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
and this is just my experiment right now

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.919 
and this is just my experiment right now
but<00:00:57.460> I<00:00:57.489> want<00:00:57.729> to<00:00:57.789> make<00:00:57.969> sure<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.719> I<00:00:58.780> don't

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
but I want to make sure that I don't

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.259 
but I want to make sure that I don't
muddy<00:00:59.589> up<00:00:59.799> my<00:00:59.979> color<00:01:00.249> I<00:01:00.339> keep<00:01:00.639> it<00:01:00.760> as<00:01:00.850> fresh<00:01:01.030> as

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
muddy up my color I keep it as fresh as

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.140 
muddy up my color I keep it as fresh as
I<00:01:01.389> can<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.409> graphite<00:01:02.859> will<00:01:03.129> kill<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.030> if

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
I can and the graphite will kill it if

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.860 
I can and the graphite will kill it if
you're<00:01:04.269> not<00:01:04.420> careful<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:07.270> why<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:07.630> kept

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
you're not careful that's why we kept

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.510 
you're not careful that's why we kept
the<00:01:07.960> eyes<00:01:08.110> clean<00:01:08.620> until<00:01:09.070> we<00:01:09.160> were<00:01:09.250> ready<00:01:09.400> to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
the eyes clean until we were ready to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.580 
the eyes clean until we were ready to
put<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.760> color<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:13.200> look<00:01:14.200> kind<00:01:14.530> of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
put the color in look kind of

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.760 
put the color in look kind of
interesting<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.340> have<00:01:15.490> those<00:01:15.700> whiter<00:01:16.770> areas

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
interesting to have those whiter areas

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.710 
interesting to have those whiter areas
where<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.100> color<00:01:18.340> was<00:01:18.550> going<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:22.660> I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
where the color was going to be and I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.270 
where the color was going to be and I
can<00:01:22.900> keep<00:01:23.050> working<00:01:23.200> on<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.920> every<00:01:24.100> once

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
can keep working on this and every once

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.590 
can keep working on this and every once
in<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.430> while<00:01:24.580> come<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:25.000> there<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.390> maybe

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
in a while come in there and maybe

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.040 
in a while come in there and maybe
sharpen<00:01:26.530> up<00:01:26.620> one<00:01:26.830> thing<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.900> usually<00:01:28.900> don't

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
sharpen up one thing I I usually don't

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.970 
sharpen up one thing I I usually don't
like<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.350> go<00:01:29.620> along<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.250> do<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.700> whole<00:01:31.360> edge<00:01:32.320> I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
like to go along and do a whole edge I

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.810 
like to go along and do a whole edge I
am<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.850> like<00:01:34.120> to<00:01:34.330> come<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.500> maybe<00:01:36.430> do

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
am I like to come in and just maybe do

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.840 
am I like to come in and just maybe do
one<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.350> one<00:01:38.560> there<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.250> it's<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.490> bit

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
one here one there so it's a little bit

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.660 
one here one there so it's a little bit
more<00:01:40.060> natural<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.840> have<00:01:41.380> an<00:01:41.500> opportunity<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
more natural I have an opportunity to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.660 
more natural I have an opportunity to
avoid<00:01:43.150> doing<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:44.050> sawtooth<00:01:44.650> edge<00:01:44.980> or<00:01:45.340> something

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
avoid doing a sawtooth edge or something

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.120 
avoid doing a sawtooth edge or something
like<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.620> where<00:01:47.620> everything<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
like that where everything is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.450 
like that where everything is
incremental<00:01:48.730> just<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.010> real<00:01:51.190> easy<00:01:51.310> to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
incremental just and it's real easy to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.270 
incremental just and it's real easy to
get<00:01:51.640> in<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.910> mode<00:01:52.120> when<00:01:52.390> you're<00:01:52.480> drawing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.260 

I<00:01:58.280> think<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.370> some<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.760> look<00:01:59.970> at<00:02:00.120> your

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I think if some of you look at your

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
I think if some of you look at your
drawings<00:02:00.750> you'll<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.010> might<00:02:02.220> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
drawings you'll see that that might be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.900 
drawings you'll see that that might be
one<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.850> things<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.420> might<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.900> to

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
one of the things that you might want to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:16.790 
one of the things that you might want to
address<00:02:05.910> on<00:02:06.300> your<00:02:07.640> on<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:09.229> cat<00:02:15.410> now<00:02:16.410> I've<00:02:16.620> got

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
address on your on your cat now I've got

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
address on your on your cat now I've got
a<00:02:16.830> curve<00:02:17.100> face<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.640> remember<00:02:18.090> we've<00:02:18.240> got

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
a curve face here remember we've got

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.949 
a curve face here remember we've got
this<00:02:18.770> curving<00:02:19.770> under<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.790> into<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.690> shadow

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
this curving under and into that shadow

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.070 
this curving under and into that shadow
so<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.910> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.240> show<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
so I really want to show that this is a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.650 
so I really want to show that this is a
little<00:02:25.290> maybe<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.430> showing<00:02:26.700> ever<00:02:27.030> subtle

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
little maybe just showing ever subtle

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.500 
little maybe just showing ever subtle
curving<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.160> darker<00:02:29.700> that's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
curving and it's a little darker that's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
curving and it's a little darker that's
how<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:30.780> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.350> rather<00:02:31.650> than<00:02:31.860> this

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
how I'm going to do it rather than this

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.120 
how I'm going to do it rather than this
or<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.230> want<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.800> don't<00:02:34.950> want<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
or this it's just I want I don't want to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.790 
or this it's just I want I don't want to
forget<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.520> I've<00:02:35.850> got<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> curved<00:02:36.650> muzzle<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
forget that I've got a curved muzzle a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.750 
forget that I've got a curved muzzle a
curved<00:02:38.630> head<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:45.030> maintain<00:02:45.239> this

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
curved head so I can maintain this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.390 
curved head so I can maintain this
detail<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.200> still<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.590> feather<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
detail and still just feather in a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.420 
detail and still just feather in a
little<00:02:50.610> value<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.239> suggest<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.350> going<00:02:52.650> round

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
little value to suggest it's going round

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.470 
little value to suggest it's going round
and<00:02:53.910> under<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.550> also<00:02:56.700> take<00:02:57.030> some<00:02:57.090> off

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and under and I can also take some off

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.500 
and under and I can also take some off
to<00:02:57.750> show<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.830> variations<00:02:59.489> you<00:03:00.120> can

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to show some of the variations you can

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.820 
to show some of the variations you can
see<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.930> those<00:03:01.080> variations<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
see some of those variations here and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.620 
see some of those variations here and
show<00:03:04.830> some<00:03:05.160> texture<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.820> interest<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.450> there

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
show some texture and interest in there

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570 
show some texture and interest in there
instead<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.260> making<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.920> all<00:03:08.040> flat<00:03:08.400> in

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
instead of just making it all flat in

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.900 
instead of just making it all flat in
one<00:03:08.610> color

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.220 

kind<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.940> little<00:03:16.180> layers<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.810> know<00:03:16.840> there's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
kind of little layers you know there's

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.210 
kind of little layers you know there's
these<00:03:17.920> almost<00:03:18.550> like<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.819> terrorists<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.950> going

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
these almost like a terrorists all going

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.030 
these almost like a terrorists all going
backwards<00:03:21.700> almost<00:03:22.180> bit

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.589 

I<00:03:29.390> also<00:03:30.390> don't<00:03:30.629> want<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.569> a

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
I also don't want to just this this is a

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.110 
I also don't want to just this this is a
short-haired<00:03:34.049> cat<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:35.219> I<00:03:35.250> could<00:03:35.700> really

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
short-haired cat so I could really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.119 
short-haired cat so I could really
easily<00:03:36.540> start<00:03:37.200> thinking<00:03:37.590> well<00:03:37.739> I'll<00:03:37.920> just

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
easily start thinking well I'll just

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.860 
easily start thinking well I'll just
keep<00:03:38.370> drawing<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.849> line<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.510> comes<00:03:39.719> out

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
keep drawing that line that comes out

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.030 
keep drawing that line that comes out
letting<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.230> know<00:03:40.290> from<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> edge<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
letting you know from the edge of the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.809 
letting you know from the edge of the
nose<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:42.500> keep<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.769> up<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.189> I<00:03:44.219> like<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.670> make

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
nose and keep that up but I like to make

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.500 
nose and keep that up but I like to make
them<00:03:45.000> short<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:45.629> I<00:03:45.870> end<00:03:46.470> up<00:03:46.620> by<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:48.060> know<00:03:48.090> kind

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
them short so I end up by you know kind

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.580 
them short so I end up by you know kind
of<00:03:48.950> cutting<00:03:49.950> them<00:03:50.069> off<00:03:50.959> almost<00:03:51.959> like<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.290> criss

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
of cutting them off almost like a criss

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.210 
of cutting them off almost like a criss
cross<00:03:53.689> and<00:03:54.689> that<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.290> keeps<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.859> from<00:03:56.040> looking

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
cross and that it keeps it from looking

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.819 
cross and that it keeps it from looking
like<00:03:56.549> it's<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.879> one<00:03:57.060> long<00:03:57.239> here<00:03:57.689> but<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.500> want

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
like it's just one long here but I want

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.069 
like it's just one long here but I want
to<00:03:58.889> be<00:03:58.980> careful<00:03:59.219> I<00:03:59.459> don't<00:03:59.609> get<00:03:59.760> too<00:03:59.939> dark<00:04:00.180> but

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
to be careful I don't get too dark but

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.410 
to be careful I don't get too dark but
as<00:04:01.260> I've<00:04:01.439> said<00:04:01.650> before<00:04:01.709> two<00:04:02.340> sometimes<00:04:02.939> it's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
as I've said before two sometimes it's

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.830 
as I've said before two sometimes it's
nice<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.689> develop<00:04:04.639> something<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.689> may

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
nice to develop something and it may

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.300 
nice to develop something and it may
turn<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.079> little<00:04:07.409> darker<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.099> know<00:04:08.250> you

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
turn a little darker but you know you

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.050 
turn a little darker but you know you
can<00:04:08.579> tap<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.120> off<00:04:09.530> overall<00:04:10.639> you<00:04:11.639> have<00:04:11.849> your

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
can tap it off overall you have your

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.199 
can tap it off overall you have your
detail<00:04:12.569> then<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.709> can<00:04:14.489> tap<00:04:14.970> back

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
detail then and then you can tap back

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.659 
detail then and then you can tap back
the<00:04:15.389> values<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.199> it<00:04:16.380> maintains<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.039> texture

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
the values so it maintains that texture

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:26.660 
the values so it maintains that texture
and<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:23.550> regulate<00:04:23.820> how<00:04:24.120> dark<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.509> is
