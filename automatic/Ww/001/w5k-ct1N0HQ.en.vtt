 motorcycle wm old son 9 08 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.410
 all around Bleekemolen in the west of gasoline except Basso and Andrija 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.690
 Pendic is the way to the 24-hour race of Le Bon 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.889
 Magna is ever the nose Away barrier is a Pole 

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:22.960
 early leadership 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.169
 the mobile bill 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.179
 He became the first tortured Treluyer entirely Timo Bernhard portal without murder 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.900
 to Nina and if I want to of course in his old top-star degree possible 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.899
 the choice of this tutorial before in Plattling 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.220
 he succeeded in that he is definitely ahead of Alexander Wurz profits 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.940
 are not suitable so action 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 but Magnin remains locked on the fifth position Transformer 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 the two Audi r18 and then the tables 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.480
 Bürstadt was fine, even at the 24-hour race 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.680
 you always have not got that right 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 Of course, it should finally go off percent 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.840
 because it's afraid in the first eleven 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 yes, some already a few places around the good 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.100
 and who might leave 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.830
 not so satisfactory 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.210
 adjust again last year 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.970
 and look there it can be 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.130
 Percent to complications but so far did not want to thank God 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 and you will be among the people 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.130
 Finding the fast rhythm of what public safety would be like 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.250
 another two laps 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.710
 alarmingly November 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.480
 clairvoyance 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 and what policies is there maybe from the 8th 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.660
 because he stuck the culprit then do it 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.940
 with Christoph Drösser in the back on the squares two and three of the petrol engine 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.700
 rating 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.630
 at the very front Grant Bleekemolen the Communist Union 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.549
 Marien Nicola Lettieri Maury Corbis at 9 o'clock at 8 barely imaginable Wolfgang 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.740
 Ullrich 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.710
 the district administrator 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.860
 he had to spend 24 hours in the fall to spend it comes the first 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 attack 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.780
 Whoever was Nicole Jost always slightly faster on the straights 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.080
 as the Audis Zacher 3 km difference we have seen in some 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.350
 Training sessions that were 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.329
 Months to accomplish 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:09.879
 30 km 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.259
 that is of course that's the essence of Sal 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.759
 The most beautiful viewpoints are the 3 km otherwise over Wind Bar 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.109
 also I can imagine on the straights so far be relatively difficult 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.069
 it was already seen that was possible but now if you saw 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.259
 sometimes around 50 meters of obstacle so that will be enough in any case » 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.669
 Do not worry, do not worry 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.469
 «We are now seen less for the eyes so far we have 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.879
 can see which lap times are driven certified cultures 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.369
 Audio can not compensate 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:48.769
 off and then after the first final day of the first test phase, it's barely too 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.689
 take 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.129
 wear the better tire then we can be very and Bitterfeld 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.380
 Differences between individual have been 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.590
 related to tire wear and related to that time 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.809
 slow down than before 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.539
 In any case, to see clearly that again drive them into their own league 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:07.999
 all this is looking for 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.659
 out of those two by three cars now hangs in the faction 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.739
 closed 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.209
 Honoring Bleekemolen on the vice-position 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.639
 Fans from the previous week were expected to be lost just in front of the chest 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.859
 do not go along 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.289
 but this is 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.289
 a suitable works car depending on a lift of 5 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.359
 Darfur, however, they the differences, however large so from the time ago 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.519
 were located at least five seconds six seconds between 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.199
 these cars and between them 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.429
 Sammer normal gasoline powered vehicles also from the top 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.859
 Bonner's speed is about 15 to 15 kilometers in between 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.089
 of course worlds 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.109
 So far, the team boss has before project start 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.109
 his car is currently on the eighth position 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.819
 until the 89 on the technical stand of the previous year 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.379
 apart from this 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.549
 that one has made the motorcycles durable here comes the attack of 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.040
 Nicola Knof Auto on her way so that's the first new one 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.469
 Web-based 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.799
 completes so that the culprit is at the top 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.799
 improved thanks to Hambrecht 101 ever since 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.699
 the new car 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:19.659
 they should be one 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.779
 very defensive route 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.680
 Knowing that to drive the wrong tire of the top 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.910
 all voluntarily left ultimately fell instead to one in comparison 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.040
 to the previous year on smaller Luftmengenbegrenzer a small he 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.039
 has prescribed 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.830
 A top car soaks up as long as Vista will help for traffic BAV or lightning 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.539
 strikes 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.800
 then the Rother team is explained with Constanze Wegner 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.220
 Loic the railway policy Anis is the first open window wiper 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.069
 maybe from problems at the top 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.210
 the DAX lost g 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.310
 steals at the top of it with a fastest sector time one comma 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.240
 6 seconds the lead left the house with the start number 2 on the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.839
 Sister car with the start number 1 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.839
 modern form of taxes 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.960
 he still resists the advances of ermek not madness what he became here 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.580
 and Alexander Wurz on the squares behind the first six are the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 Nose forward six seconds 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.960
 how important is who can not escape the tactics of Holger Helmich 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.779
 Company dangerous clapped 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.800
 Of course, we are of course very important a bit faster 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.930
 can drive 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.930
 It is important from subject to subject 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.400
 it is as it is 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.000
 that these worries are very close to the consequences of this document 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.360
 Minute till will take longer than in the past years 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.139
 does anyone want to come during the tour? 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.460
 Vettel has free rein and Lidl 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.460
 they will certainly be played a lot 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.960
 away from the cameras or away from the house and director has 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.719
 In the GT2 category, a lot was done in the start-up phase 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.589
 We are both the target year and their skepticism 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.400
 Hydrogen is released 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.050
 Obviously in Brazil his cautious view was the early one 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.849
 Leadership is 6 percent forward there 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:27.689
 Jamal years 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.360
 Ever foul the Ferrari 4 8 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.200
 Frank Eulberg solicited in the Chevrolet Corvette 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 Themselves to research and policy of hardship 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.430
 Rinaldo Capello watched 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.460
 what's wrong dispute, Ermek's team-mate does not expect him 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.050
 later 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.050
 in the car of the Scots will take over 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.830
 quickly find 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.830
 on the very front 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.550
 July a format 6 4 Timo Bernhard 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.439
 there 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.479
 Of course it was that we were very very 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.330
 in criticism January this is the hour of truth carpenter has that 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.259
 Qualifying 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.689
 Apple, of course, there is traffic situation 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.919
 Picture of Germany is in the evening the West keep with him not only the 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.089
 Demand from therefore there may be shifts 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.319
 To say that maybe I do not want to really admit it 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.919
 but 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:22.530
 and last supernatural 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.529
 in the first rounds 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.409
 Euro in the first hours after the first stints you will see who came 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.729
 who is capable of what and percent one has to say 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:33.680
 and like that 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.830
 For him, Hollander moves forward 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.969
 yes, she pursues with hawkish eyes 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:43.490
 Of course that's not a problem for five minutes, he threw it in front of her 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.719
 Woman at the door set where exactly is much talk 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:49.899
 Of course we are thinking or vice versa 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.059
 do not create the other for the moment 

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:55.179
 and want to look good on King Handel 

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:58.809
 and have now pool for very good pace and can confirm what the 

00:07:58.809 --> 00:07:59.819
 Have shown powder
