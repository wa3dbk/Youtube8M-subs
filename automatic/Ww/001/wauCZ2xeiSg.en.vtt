00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
tightly you don't rip so loosen flies

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.990 
tightly you don't rip so loosen flies
off<00:00:57.980> as<00:00:58.100> soon<00:00:58.190> as<00:00:58.309> he<00:00:58.370> hit<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.489> strings<00:00:58.820> but

off as soon as he hit the strings but

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.850 
off as soon as he hit the strings but
you<00:00:59.629> don't<00:00:59.780> over<00:01:00.170> grip<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.530> cause<00:01:00.649> any

you don't over grip and cause any
tension<00:01:01.250> in<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.399> wrist<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.699> top<00:01:02.469> and<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.859> ID

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
tension in the wrist the top and the ID

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.260 
tension in the wrist the top and the ID
of<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.190> plectrum<00:01:04.520> although<00:01:05.089> it's<00:01:05.210> more

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
of the plectrum although it's more

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.109 
of the plectrum although it's more
difficult<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.110> start<00:01:06.410> with<00:01:06.560> is<00:01:07.000> there's<00:01:08.000> a

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
difficult to start with is there's a

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.480 
difficult to start with is there's a
technique<00:01:08.630> called<00:01:08.810> turner<00:01:09.380> picking<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.220> this

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
technique called turner picking and this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.820 
technique called turner picking and this
means<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.820> pick<00:01:11.030> down<00:01:11.890> now<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.590> your<00:01:15.740> first

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
means you pick down now so your first

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.500 
means you pick down now so your first
rubs<00:01:16.100> or<00:01:16.250> don't<00:01:16.790> have<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.000> be<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.210> could<00:01:17.420> be

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
rubs or don't have to be that could be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.149 
rubs or don't have to be that could be
enough<00:01:17.659> but<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:18.619> case<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:18.920> gonna<00:01:19.070> go

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
enough but in this case we're gonna go

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.520 
enough but in this case we're gonna go
down<00:01:19.780> next<00:01:20.780> nope<00:01:21.229> up<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:23.110> try<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:24.880> one<00:01:25.880> string

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
down next nope up now try on one string

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.950 
down next nope up now try on one string
to<00:01:27.530> build<00:01:27.890> technique<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.960> opportunity

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
to build technique and opportunity

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.200 
to build technique and opportunity

easier<00:01:54.579> with<00:01:54.729> two<00:01:55.149> notes<00:01:55.329> per<00:01:55.509> string<00:01:55.540> scalars

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
easier with two notes per string scalars

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
down stroke which tends to feel more

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.170 
down stroke which tends to feel more
natural<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.909> good<00:02:04.000> way<00:02:04.149> of

natural so that's a good way of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.090 
natural so that's a good way of

interesting<00:02:47.530> here<00:02:48.519> we<00:02:48.610> got<00:02:48.760> those<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
interesting here we got those and

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.660 
interesting here we got those and
alternate<00:03:14.049> picking<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.500> much<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:15.549> difficult

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
alternate picking is much more difficult

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.650 
alternate picking is much more difficult
for<00:03:16.109> first<00:03:17.109> time<00:03:17.319> beginner<00:03:17.680> students<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.660> we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
for first time beginner students then we

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.330 
for first time beginner students then we
tend<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> naturally<00:03:20.380> want<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.769> pick<00:03:20.920> downwards

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
tend to naturally want to pick downwards

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.460 
tend to naturally want to pick downwards
but<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.329> much<00:03:22.540> better<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.930> can<00:03:23.049> get<00:03:23.200> into

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
but it's much better if you can get into

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.539 
but it's much better if you can get into
it<00:03:23.560> because<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> hard<00:03:24.130> habit<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.459> break

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
it because it's a hard habit to break

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.569 
it because it's a hard habit to break
afterwards<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.799> there<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.920> some<00:03:27.160> there<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.549> a

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
afterwards and there is some there are a

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.569 
afterwards and there is some there are a
few<00:03:27.730> tabs<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.600> website<00:03:29.350> one<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.430> springs

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
few tabs on the website one that springs

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.580 
few tabs on the website one that springs
to<00:03:30.790> mind<00:03:30.880> that's<00:03:31.180> quite<00:03:31.510> difficult<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.380> play

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
to mind that's quite difficult to play

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.280 
to mind that's quite difficult to play
without<00:03:32.880> also<00:03:33.880> picking<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.930> theme<00:03:35.139> from

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
without also picking is the theme from

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.039 
without also picking is the theme from
the<00:03:35.410> James<00:03:35.590> Bond<00:03:38.489> at<00:03:39.489> look<00:03:39.700> fast<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.420> it's

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
the James Bond at look fast and it's

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.479 
the James Bond at look fast and it's
quite<00:03:41.230> difficult<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.620> blow<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:41.950> down<00:03:42.190> stroke

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
quite difficult to blow just down stroke

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.000 
quite difficult to blow just down stroke
so<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.930> well<00:03:44.079> as<00:03:44.170> getting<00:03:44.319> these<00:03:44.470> few<00:03:44.739> lessons

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
so as well as getting these few lessons

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.289 
so as well as getting these few lessons
under<00:03:45.340> your<00:03:45.459> belt<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.910> might<00:03:46.060> want<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.239> check

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
under your belt you might want to check

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.690 
under your belt you might want to check
out<00:03:46.420> some<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.840> taps<00:03:47.049> on<00:03:47.200> there<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.700> try

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
out some of the taps on there and try

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.819 
out some of the taps on there and try
try<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.420> develop<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.260> picking<00:03:50.560> it's

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
try to develop this one so picking it's

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:58.050 
try to develop this one so picking it's
much<00:03:50.980> more<00:03:51.160> important<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.910> play<00:03:52.540> slowly

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.250 

again<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.180> will<00:03:59.239> turn<00:03:59.390> picket<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.140> to

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
again it will turn picket that it is to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.149 
again it will turn picket that it is to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
people up to the idea is a lot harder it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.670 
people up to the idea is a lot harder it
is<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.400> actually<00:04:13.549> try<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.879> downstroke
