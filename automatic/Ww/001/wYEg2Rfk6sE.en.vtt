many collector's edition with it the
reason<00:01:06.180> why<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
reason why I say that is because it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.310 
reason why I say that is because it
brings<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.369> nostalgic<00:01:09.119> feeling<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.080> had

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
brings back the nostalgic feeling we had

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.310 
brings back the nostalgic feeling we had
at<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> start<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> Grand<00:01:11.790> Theft<00:01:11.970> Auto<00:01:12.180> 5<00:01:12.630> back

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
at the start of Grand Theft Auto 5 back

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700 
at the start of Grand Theft Auto 5 back
in<00:01:13.530> September<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> 17th<00:01:14.840> 2013<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.320> reasoning

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
in September the 17th 2013 the reasoning

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.050 
in September the 17th 2013 the reasoning
behind<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> do

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
behind this is because if you do

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
behind this is because if you do
remember<00:01:18.270> Utley<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.320> people<00:01:19.590> who<00:01:19.650> had

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
remember Utley the only people who had

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
remember Utley the only people who had
the<00:01:19.860> clefts<00:01:20.189> Edition<00:01:20.580> would<00:01:20.970> instantly<00:01:21.479> go

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the clefts Edition would instantly go

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
the clefts Edition would instantly go
and<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> hot<00:01:22.200> knife<00:01:22.409> mainly<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> hot

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and get the hot knife mainly the hot

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
and get the hot knife mainly the hot
knife<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> most

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
knife because that was the most
