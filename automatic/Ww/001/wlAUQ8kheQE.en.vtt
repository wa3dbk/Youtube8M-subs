lever version of the belt hence the big
clasp<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.369> front<00:00:23.970> some<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.869> things<00:00:25.109> you'll

which is a very popular one and this is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.609 
which is a very popular one and this is
also<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.580> 13<00:00:30.179> millimeter<00:00:30.510> version<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

also the 13 millimeter version of the
belt<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> thicker<00:00:32.700> version<00:00:32.969> there's

belt so it's the thicker version there's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.049 
belt so it's the thicker version there's
also<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:34.950> thick<00:00:35.219> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> 10

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
also one that's not as thick which is 10

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.790 
also one that's not as thick which is 10
millimeters<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.590> necessarily

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
millimeters now you don't necessarily

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.760 
millimeters now you don't necessarily
have<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> lever<00:00:39.510> version<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
have to get the lever version there is a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.040 
have to get the lever version there is a
prong<00:00:41.160> version<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:42.899> look

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
prong version as well it would look

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.810 
prong version as well it would look
something<00:00:43.290> similar<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> where<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> have

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
something similar to this where you have

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
something similar to this where you have
a<00:00:44.850> metal<00:00:45.090> clasp<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.410> case<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a metal clasp and in this case this is a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
a metal clasp and in this case this is a
dual<00:00:47.550> prong<00:00:47.940> since<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.960> ones

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
dual prong since there are two ones

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
dual prong since there are two ones
coming<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.940> single

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
coming out you can also get a single

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
coming out you can also get a single
prong<00:00:51.750> version<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> works<00:00:52.710> very<00:00:52.980> similar

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
prong version and it works very similar

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
prong version and it works very similar
to<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> normal<00:00:54.059> belt<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> tighten

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to a normal belt where you tighten

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
to a normal belt where you tighten
yourself<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.800> put<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> prongs<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.520> place<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
yourself you put the prongs in place and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.119

one second now as far as the lever
itself<00:01:05.700> goes<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> works<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> very

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
itself goes the way it works is very

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
very uncomfortable you might need help

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.740 
very uncomfortable you might need help
from<00:01:38.790> somebody<00:01:39.000> else<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> might<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
from somebody else you might need a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
from somebody else you might need a
screwdriver<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.500> some<00:01:40.710> cases<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.909> know

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
screwdriver in some cases but just know

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
screwdriver in some cases but just know
that<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> normal<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.470> first<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.189> first

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that it is normal so first things first

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
that it is normal so first things first
when<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.630> tight

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
when you do that it's going to be tight

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
when you do that it's going to be tight
so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.170> wouldn't<00:01:46.590> necessarily<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so I wouldn't necessarily go to the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
so I wouldn't necessarily go to the
tightest<00:01:48.240> setting<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.140> away<00:01:49.220> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
tightest setting you can right away just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.590 
tightest setting you can right away just
because<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> call

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
because you don't want to have to call

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
because you don't want to have to call
the<00:01:51.840> paramedics<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.560> firefighters<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> come

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the paramedics or firefighters to come

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.160 
the paramedics or firefighters to come
and<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.869> belt

and actually get you out of this belt

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.350 
and actually get you out of this belt
now<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.070> far<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.340> setting<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:56.939> certain

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
now as far as setting it up for certain

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.670 
now as far as setting it up for certain
tightness<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> inside

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
tightness is you will see on the inside

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760 
tightness is you will see on the inside
you<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.700> two<00:02:00.000> flathead<00:02:00.689> screws<00:02:01.079> right<00:02:01.409> here

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you have two flathead screws right here

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
you have two flathead screws right here
and<00:02:01.950> multiple<00:02:02.670> holes<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.360> want<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and multiple holes in which you want to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
and multiple holes in which you want to
put<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.439> depending<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.310> size<00:02:05.549> waist

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
put it so depending on what size waist

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.459 
put it so depending on what size waist
you<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> injure<00:02:07.170> site

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you are you would go to the injure site

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.919 
you are you would go to the injure site
and<00:02:07.710> measure<00:02:08.129> waist<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.420> get<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and measure waist you would then get a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.110 
and measure waist you would then get a
corresponding<00:02:10.379> belt<00:02:11.099> size<00:02:11.340> depending<00:02:11.970> on

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
corresponding belt size depending on

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
corresponding belt size depending on
where<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.569> waist<00:02:12.810> falls<00:02:13.110> between

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
where your waist falls between

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
where your waist falls between
mean<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.860> again<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.580> will<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.790> some<00:02:15.180> range

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
mean and again you will have some range

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.089 
mean and again you will have some range
of<00:02:15.569> motion<00:02:15.630> as<00:02:16.050> far<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.410> where<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.800> want<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
of motion as far as where you want to

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.880 
of motion as far as where you want to
actually<00:02:17.280> set<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.360> once<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.770> in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
actually set this up once you have it in

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.460 
actually set this up once you have it in
the<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.220> place<00:02:20.580> simple<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.260> put

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the right place simple is you just put

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.170 
the right place simple is you just put
it<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.620> those<00:02:22.800> four<00:02:23.040> prongs<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.610> front<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it in those four prongs up front and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.930 
it in those four prongs up front and
then<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.500> pull<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> lever<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.550> what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
then you just pull a lever and what

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
then you just pull a lever and what
happens<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> that's<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.989> pull<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.440> belt

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
happens is that's going to pull the belt

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.009 
happens is that's going to pull the belt
tighter<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> reason<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.450> went<00:02:30.660> with<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
tighter so the reason I went with a

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.470 
tighter so the reason I went with a
lever<00:02:31.380> belt<00:02:31.769> over<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.580> prong<00:02:32.849> version<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
lever belt over the prong version is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.059 
lever belt over the prong version is
because<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.810> feel<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.560> gets<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
because I feel like this gets you a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.729 
because I feel like this gets you a
tighter<00:02:35.580> overall<00:02:36.269> fit<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.349> really

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
tighter overall fit and that's really

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.380 
tighter overall fit and that's really
one<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.099> key<00:02:38.340> things<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.880> any<00:02:39.090> good

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
one of the key things with any good

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.940 
one of the key things with any good
solid<00:02:39.780> belt<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
solid belt it's really going to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.970 
solid belt it's really going to
stabilize<00:02:41.790> your<00:02:42.060> core<00:02:42.390> even<00:02:42.900> more<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.769> these

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
stabilize your core even more so these

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.590 
stabilize your core even more so these
really<00:02:44.340> come<00:02:44.519> into<00:02:44.670> play<00:02:45.030> when<00:02:45.300> we're<00:02:45.480> dealing

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really come into play when we're dealing

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.870 
really come into play when we're dealing
with<00:02:45.780> very<00:02:45.930> heavy<00:02:46.440> weights<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.519> when<00:02:47.760> you're

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
with very heavy weights so when you're

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.479 
with very heavy weights so when you're
moving<00:02:48.060> optimal<00:02:48.810> loads<00:02:49.049> low<00:02:49.709> reps<00:02:50.040> heavy

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
moving optimal loads low reps heavy

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.430 
moving optimal loads low reps heavy
weights<00:02:50.819> these<00:02:51.269> things<00:02:51.569> can<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:51.870> make<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
weights these things can really make a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.559 
weights these things can really make a
huge<00:02:52.860> difference<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:54.090> why<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.360> don't

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
huge difference and that's why you don't

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.590 
huge difference and that's why you don't
really<00:02:54.840> want<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> skimp<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.769> belt<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:57.330> for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
really want to skimp on a belt so for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.050 
really want to skimp on a belt so for
example<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:59.040> belt<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.549> have<00:02:59.700> here

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
example on this belt that I have here

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
example on this belt that I have here
it's<00:03:00.269> very<00:03:00.330> loose<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.080> very<00:03:01.290> flimsy<00:03:01.650> you'll

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's very loose it's very flimsy you'll

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.580 
it's very loose it's very flimsy you'll
see<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.269> size<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.110> belt<00:03:04.349> actually

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
see that the size of the belt actually

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.000 
see that the size of the belt actually
changes<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.760> go<00:03:06.000> around<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.739> bag

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
changes as you go around and this bag

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.009 
changes as you go around and this bag
padding<00:03:08.459> part<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.880> very<00:03:09.150> easy<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.630> kind<00:03:09.900> of

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
padding part is very easy to kind of

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.259 
padding part is very easy to kind of
play<00:03:10.230> around<00:03:10.380> with<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.400> using<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.030> for

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
play around with so using this for

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.089 
play around with so using this for
optimal<00:03:12.690> loads<00:03:12.900> isn't<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:13.650> beneficial

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
optimal loads isn't really beneficial

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.039 
optimal loads isn't really beneficial
because<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.180> really<00:03:15.510> doing<00:03:15.690> anything

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
because it's not really doing anything

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.840 
because it's not really doing anything
it's<00:03:16.440> almost<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.950> equivalent<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.609> wearing

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
it's almost the equivalent of wearing

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.699 
it's almost the equivalent of wearing
just<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.239> normal<00:03:18.720> belt<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.320> would<00:03:19.500> for

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
just a normal belt like you would for

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.770 
just a normal belt like you would for
your<00:03:19.739> pants<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> gym<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.299> you're<00:03:21.660> not

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
your pants to the gym so you're not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.289 
your pants to the gym so you're not
getting<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.140> ton<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.350> extra<00:03:22.560> support<00:03:23.060> now<00:03:24.060> where

getting a ton of extra support now where

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.270

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
a big selling point this is very

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.930 
a big selling point this is very
reinforced<00:03:43.590> it's<00:03:43.739> very<00:03:44.069> hard<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.430> bend<00:03:44.760> these

it can potentially be very uncomfortable
up<00:03:58.590> front<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.670> one<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.910> the<00:03:59.970> easy<00:04:00.150> ways<00:04:00.329> to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
up front so one of the easy ways to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.390 
up front so one of the easy ways to
break<00:04:00.900> these<00:04:01.109> things<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.920> people<00:04:02.250> will

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
break these things in that people will

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.210 
break these things in that people will
do<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:02.880> simply<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:03.660> rolling<00:04:04.410> them<00:04:04.620> several

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
do is simply just rolling them several

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.110 
do is simply just rolling them several
times<00:04:05.250> over<00:04:07.280> almost<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.730> would<00:04:08.850> break

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
times over almost like you would break

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.479 
times over almost like you would break
in<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.540> baseball<00:04:10.079> glove<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.650> obviously<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
in a baseball glove and obviously you

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.280 
in a baseball glove and obviously you
can<00:04:11.670> take<00:04:11.850> off<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.060> clasp<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.840> roll<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.139> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
can take off the clasp and roll it the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.020 
can take off the clasp and roll it the
other<00:04:13.440> way<00:04:13.650> too<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.069> loosen<00:04:14.400> these<00:04:14.519> things<00:04:14.850> up

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
other way too to loosen these things up

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.629 
other way too to loosen these things up
a<00:04:15.150> bit<00:04:15.359> but<00:04:15.840> again<00:04:16.169> generally<00:04:17.039> speaking<00:04:17.370> when

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
a bit but again generally speaking when

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
most people get these they do take some

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.529 
most people get these they do take some
time<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.919> break<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.940> got<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> play<00:04:21.329> with<00:04:21.359> it

time to break in you got to play with it

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.330 
time to break in you got to play with it
but<00:04:21.900> overall<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.440> got<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.710> wear<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.159> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
they're really great when it comes to

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.740 
they're really great when it comes to
these<00:05:07.979> things<00:05:08.039> these<00:05:08.460> belts<00:05:08.849> are<00:05:09.000> custom<00:05:09.570> made

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
these things these belts are custom made

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.390 
these things these belts are custom made
for<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.110> most<00:05:10.289> part<00:05:10.590> when<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.889> order<00:05:11.250> them

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
for the most part when you order them

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.640 
for the most part when you order them
and<00:05:11.669> that's<00:05:12.180> why<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.479> generally<00:05:12.960> takes<00:05:13.229> two<00:05:13.530> to

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and that's why it generally takes two to

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.560 
and that's why it generally takes two to
three<00:05:13.860> weeks<00:05:14.099> in<00:05:14.280> order<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.610> get<00:05:14.789> them<00:05:15.060> now

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
three weeks in order to get them now

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.120 
three weeks in order to get them now
when<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.810> ordered<00:05:16.139> mine<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.530> ordered<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.889> around

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
when I ordered mine it ordered it around

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.040 
when I ordered mine it ordered it around
Christmas<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.940> took<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.150> long<00:05:18.419> time<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.720> come

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
Christmas so it took a long time to come

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.930 
Christmas so it took a long time to come
in<00:05:19.259> only<00:05:19.680> because<00:05:19.830> they<00:05:20.190> had<00:05:20.340> an<00:05:20.460> inrush<00:05:20.789> of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
in only because they had an inrush of

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.850 
in only because they had an inrush of
orders<00:05:21.360> but<00:05:21.900> again<00:05:22.169> generally<00:05:22.560> speaking

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
orders but again generally speaking

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.589 
orders but again generally speaking
depending<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.669> color<00:05:23.909> it's<00:05:24.270> going<00:05:24.539> to

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
depending on the color it's going to

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.540 
depending on the color it's going to
take<00:05:24.780> around<00:05:25.080> two<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.409> three<00:05:25.620> weeks<00:05:25.889> they<00:05:26.490> do

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
take around two to three weeks they do

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.580 
take around two to three weeks they do
say<00:05:26.940> however<00:05:27.090> they<00:05:27.360> normally<00:05:27.780> keep<00:05:27.990> black<00:05:28.319> in

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
say however they normally keep black in

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.100 
say however they normally keep black in
stocks<00:05:29.009> of<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:29.400> order<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.820> black<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.630> usually

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
stocks of you order the black it usually

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.499 
stocks of you order the black it usually
will<00:05:31.259> come<00:05:31.289> a<00:05:31.470> lot<00:05:31.710> faster<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.370> well<00:05:32.729> now<00:05:33.479> as

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
will come a lot faster as well now as

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.629 
will come a lot faster as well now as
far<00:05:33.930> as<00:05:33.990> which<00:05:34.409> belt<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.800> should<00:05:34.979> get<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.370> ten

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
far as which belt you should get the ten

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.850 
far as which belt you should get the ten
or<00:05:35.789> the<00:05:35.909> thirteen<00:05:36.389> millimeter<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:37.500> really<00:05:37.830> a

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
or the thirteen millimeter it's really a

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.520 
or the thirteen millimeter it's really a
matter<00:05:38.099> of<00:05:38.310> preference<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:39.000> think<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.599> typically

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
matter of preference I think I typically

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.499 
matter of preference I think I typically
would<00:05:40.830> suggest<00:05:41.070> people<00:05:41.460> go<00:05:41.639> with<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:41.940> 13

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
would suggest people go with the 13

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.060 
would suggest people go with the 13
millimeter<00:05:42.719> only<00:05:43.229> because<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.650> more

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
millimeter only because it is more

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.730 
millimeter only because it is more
reinforced<00:05:44.909> and<00:05:45.060> again<00:05:45.330> that's<00:05:46.020> really<00:05:46.380> what

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
reinforced and again that's really what

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.620 
reinforced and again that's really what
you<00:05:46.889> want<00:05:47.190> these<00:05:47.370> things<00:05:47.639> for<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.120> begin<00:05:48.270> with

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
you want these things for to begin with

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.050 
you want these things for to begin with
and<00:05:48.900> with<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.560> 13<00:05:50.009> millimeter<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.610> wouldn't

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
and with the 13 millimeter I wouldn't

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.120 
and with the 13 millimeter I wouldn't
want<00:05:51.240> someone<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.570> buy<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.719> 10<00:05:52.169> only<00:05:52.469> to<00:05:52.889> later

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
want someone to buy the 10 only to later

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.189 
want someone to buy the 10 only to later
realize<00:05:53.610> that<00:05:53.820> hey<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.300> would<00:05:54.750> have<00:05:54.840> preferred

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
realize that hey I would have preferred

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.469 
realize that hey I would have preferred
the<00:05:55.380> 13<00:05:55.949> or<00:05:56.190> grow<00:05:56.460> out<00:05:56.639> of<00:05:56.669> it<00:05:56.940> only<00:05:57.120> because

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
the 13 or grow out of it only because

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.330 
the 13 or grow out of it only because
these<00:05:57.690> belts<00:05:58.110> should<00:05:58.259> honestly<00:05:58.740> last<00:05:59.070> you

these belts should honestly last you

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.279 
these belts should honestly last you
forever<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.210> it's<00:06:00.419> one<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:00.719> those<00:06:00.810> things<00:06:01.110> in

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
forever and it's one of those things in

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.450 
forever and it's one of those things in
my<00:06:01.440> opinion<00:06:01.830> if<00:06:01.949> you're<00:06:02.070> going<00:06:02.159> to<00:06:02.250> buy<00:06:02.430> one

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
my opinion if you're going to buy one

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.390 
my opinion if you're going to buy one
get<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.449> bigger<00:06:03.659> one<00:06:03.900> upfront<00:06:04.259> now<00:06:04.889> if<00:06:05.099> you're

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
get the bigger one upfront now if you're

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.730 
get the bigger one upfront now if you're
lighter<00:06:06.030> in<00:06:06.330> weight<00:06:06.360> not<00:06:07.020> as<00:06:07.199> big<00:06:07.409> in<00:06:07.590> stature

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
lighter in weight not as big in stature

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.279 
lighter in weight not as big in stature
or<00:06:08.340> you're<00:06:09.000> just<00:06:09.030> generally<00:06:09.719> annoyed<00:06:10.050> by

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
or you're just generally annoyed by

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.200 
or you're just generally annoyed by
wearing<00:06:10.560> belts<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.280> 10<00:06:11.550> might<00:06:11.729> be<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:11.909> little

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
wearing belts the 10 might be a little

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.760 
wearing belts the 10 might be a little
bit<00:06:12.330> easier<00:06:12.659> for<00:06:12.719> you<00:06:13.050> it's<00:06:13.199> going<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.380> be<00:06:13.500> easy

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
bit easier for you it's going to be easy

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.550 
bit easier for you it's going to be easy
to<00:06:13.949> break<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.490> but<00:06:15.150> again<00:06:15.479> I<00:06:15.810> wouldn't<00:06:16.229> see<00:06:16.440> the

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
to break in but again I wouldn't see the

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.730 
to break in but again I wouldn't see the
point<00:06:16.770> of<00:06:16.830> upgrading<00:06:17.490> at<00:06:17.639> a<00:06:17.669> future<00:06:18.000> time<00:06:18.740> now

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
point of upgrading at a future time now

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.649 
point of upgrading at a future time now
as<00:06:19.979> far<00:06:20.219> as<00:06:20.280> should<00:06:20.729> you<00:06:20.759> go<00:06:21.000> with<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.389> lever

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
as far as should you go with the lever

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.050 
as far as should you go with the lever
or<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:21.990> prong<00:06:22.409> again<00:06:22.949> I<00:06:23.190> prefer<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.820> lever

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
or the prong again I prefer the lever

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.420 
or the prong again I prefer the lever
only<00:06:24.840> because<00:06:25.110> in<00:06:25.229> this<00:06:25.380> case<00:06:25.620> I<00:06:25.800> feel<00:06:26.099> like<00:06:26.310> it

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
only because in this case I feel like it

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.310 
only because in this case I feel like it
allows<00:06:26.639> you<00:06:26.789> get<00:06:26.909> a<00:06:26.940> much<00:06:27.180> tighter<00:06:27.509> fit<00:06:27.960> rather

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
allows you get a much tighter fit rather

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.080 
allows you get a much tighter fit rather
than<00:06:28.560> really<00:06:28.770> struggling<00:06:29.250> to<00:06:29.430> get<00:06:29.639> that<00:06:29.820> belt

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
than really struggling to get that belt

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.959 
than really struggling to get that belt
as<00:06:30.330> tight<00:06:30.630> as<00:06:30.780> possible<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:31.520> not<00:06:32.520> to<00:06:32.759> mention

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
as tight as possible and not to mention

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.719 
as tight as possible and not to mention
when<00:06:33.300> you're<00:06:33.449> done<00:06:33.690> it's<00:06:34.260> simple<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:34.979> easy<00:06:35.430> to

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
when you're done it's simple and easy to

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.340 
when you're done it's simple and easy to
unclasp<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.630> it's<00:06:36.750> almost<00:06:36.930> instantaneous

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
unclasp and it's almost instantaneous

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.570 
unclasp and it's almost instantaneous
well<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.560> might<00:06:38.770> really<00:06:38.950> have<00:06:39.160> to<00:06:39.310> struggle

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
well you might really have to struggle

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.580

it in my opinion for any serious lifter

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.750 
it in my opinion for any serious lifter
your<00:07:26.170> just<00:07:26.380> the<00:07:26.500> average<00:07:26.680> gym<00:07:27.160> goer<00:07:27.400> you're

heavy<00:07:32.680> overhead<00:07:33.130> press<00:07:33.430> probably<00:07:34.420> just<00:07:34.600> be

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
heavy overhead press probably just be

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.540
