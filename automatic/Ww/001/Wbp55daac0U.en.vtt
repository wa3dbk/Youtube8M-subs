00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.050
 many concerns about contempt 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.410
 the project should understand time 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.500
 continuation of the predecessor 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.540

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 than but the rich continue to indulge 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630
 Orphan Garik also decides to squeeze out

 situations of some personal gain 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.109
 the game as well as the last parts will remain 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.640
 dark influenced by the aesthetics of steam punk and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.299
 Victorian era will try 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.420

 knives game will be a clear competitor 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.959
