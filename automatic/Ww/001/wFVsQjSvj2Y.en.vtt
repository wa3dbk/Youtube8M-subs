00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 because if the friends today we are 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.309
 found for a small video 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.719
 of information 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.619
 it seems to me that it is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 the first time I make a video 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 information and it's for you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 announce that we will soon be spending 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 thousand subscribers on the chain and suddenly 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 for the first time I will organize 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 a video at the same time with my subscribers 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 because it is just that I also 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 never done we did lives and all 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 together but I never saw that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.309
 I always organize my chance video 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 georges if ever on the spit of doing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.950
 a video or whatever but I think we 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 has never really made a city ​​where 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.059
 I had planned to be with my 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 subscribers on it and that would be 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.379
 interesting that I'm going through now so 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 I 'm not going to do anything revolutionary 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.860
 you do not expect much 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.960
 just we'll organize for once 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.980
 a tournament subscribers each time before 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 that I thought to myself that what it is 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 organized a subscribers tournament I told myself 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.649
 but no it's useless because of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.719
 anyway I will not be able to fill 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.370
 the places finally I do not know I had 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.690
 I still had the world of the current 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.650
 alright but I always told myself that I 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.630
 will not be able to fill the places 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.290
 so it was not worth it that I 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.100
 make 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.720
 or maybe deep inside me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 I was just lazy finally I know 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 not so now that we will reach 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 the 1000 I think if I ask 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 still to easy psy people I 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 asks you if you want to participate in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 tournament tournaments I think that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.850
 normally we should be able to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 fill 16 people out of a thousand 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.610
 Normally it should go if I arrive 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 not to fill two tournaments with a thousand 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 subscribers that means that if the subscribers 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.040
 on bath is not active in fact so 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.110
 I would have to see something 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.020
 in my program 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.980
 this is the two tournaments 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.240
 did I'm going to organize two tournaments 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.550
 different because one knows 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.260
 this is the only session that person you 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.350
 can take this task to the fact it's 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.880
 really not it's not specially 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.990
 interesting I know that represents 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.670
 really a small part of the young 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 who are active on your dog so his 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 parents this morning qg and so I decided 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.850
 to organize two and I would like it 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.040
 do it on friday 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 in fact I hesitate between Friday 1st 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 and on Saturday, May 2nd I think I think 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.570
 that Friday actually I would have more than 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.130
 time so I would like to do the Friday 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.420
 from 18 hours that is to say that 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.300
 the first tournament would be held on Friday 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 at 6 pm until 6:30 pm or so 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.970
 that and second tournament would start as soon as 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.209
 17h45 to 19h finally until they get 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.040
 finish and for the low blow this is 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.330
 simple just physically comments 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.830
 if you want to participate in that 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.030
 you put yeah I do not know if I'm going 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.790
 to be there for the first or the second 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 tournament you turn bakel turning you 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 want to participate and that's to see with 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.390
 the places and what would be interesting 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 it is that 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.870
 sheikh people ask me a lot even 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.430
 if if you ever said you want 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220
 participate that you have not been caught 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 if you are ever connected the day of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 tournaments but if there is someone who is 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.770
 not there I would invite each other to leave on the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.290
 list anyway those who asked 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670
 his place not so even if you even if 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.100
 you have not been caught for the tournament 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.270
 there you are connected staying alert at 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.740
 case where there may be some 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.330
 absent that I will invite you to their 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.130
 place the day, so here is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.260
 rules level at rules level 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.020
 well I do not care a bit I mean 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.910
 the basic rules of online 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.519
 that is to say, ps3 boots obviously bugged 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.630
 saw that it's buggy pad ps3 brice guard 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.959
 because I do not want his rage 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.959
 after 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.380
 no 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.540
 no defensive is the same thing I 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.550
 not really want his rage and no 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.140
 waking combos wake up because 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.430
 because when you start the fight 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.730
 everyone does not have a character with 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.140
 go to this year so here are his ranks 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.340
 simple rules it's the rules with 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.780
 which we play all the time on the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.150
 online of naruto so normal me if you 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.050
 play on the online stop rules 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.240
 with which you are used to 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.890
 to play what everyone can play at this 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.280
 tournament by playing what he will play not this 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.270
 who is the advanced beginner 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 creative professionals of the game everything 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.940
 that you want you can play the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.200
 way you just want in 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.450
 respecting his four little rules that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.950
 I put that for that there is no 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.210
 complaints at the end of the tournaments or what 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.780
 everything goes well in the good mood 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.170
 so normally normally it should 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.070
 to be at the level of rules too 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.260
 it's really a turning point to subscribe 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.900
 so all the hosts youtuber or whatever 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.220
 I know nan nan not actually their 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.630
 place in this tournament ie 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.150
 if I look at this video that 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.680
 will also have our pebble senseo rio that 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.730
 me everything you want you are 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.930
 not in the tournament actually because 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.959
 it's a turning point only in me and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.100
 my subscribers if I want to play 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.200
 a bit with people who are active 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.310
 on a machine you do not know the opportunity 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.080
 to see live because everyone 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.760
 is not that day that's why 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.130
 I warn this time a week to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.340
 the advanced and I hope that by doing that 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.800
 you can be there for the tournament 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.020
 if not at the level of the characters and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.940
 support frankly I do not care 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.290
 totally you play you the person that 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.810
 you want with the support that you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.960
 personally want to play a 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.759
 support because I find that more 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.770
 already on this volume 3 it does not run 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.600
 the game so I joined personally 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.910
 support if you want to play it 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.229
 two is your problem so at the level 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.720
 characters you have no thought 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.569
 who wants to play zoo with but 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.830
 I play duet with but I see it there 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.930
 here he wants to play like that he plays 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.400
 like that and then that's how it 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.789
 is not that there is nothing to gain for the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.069
 tournament 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.360
 so if you play up 10 on a 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.280
 tournament where there is nothing to win I'm 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.990
 ask what you will play that there will be 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.789
 soups 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.139
 that's it I think I said little 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.870
 almost everything I wanted to say so 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.580
 two tournaments organized the first the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.039
 Friday 1st from 18 hours is 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.770
 to say the first from 18h to 18h30 and the 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.590
 second goal of 45 gieter surely 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.580
 7:15 pm something like that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.979
 personal when you want the four 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.330
 bishops I said them and for those who 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.680
 have not been taken yet again I 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.030
 say if you're connected today 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.099
 there you may be invited if there is 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.810
 absent and for absences if you 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.110
 can if you know you will be 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.970
 absent 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.500
 you can say one day she's moving forward on 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.870
 your comments to 8 finally I do not 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.789
 would not be there it would help a lot but 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.900
 this is finally like that and then we try 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.479
 to see how we can react and of 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.349
 take but also to those who 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.479
 will participate in a game you are waiting 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.539
 only in a week for the bye tournament 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.539
 bye
