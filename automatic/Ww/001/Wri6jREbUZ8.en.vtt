 how many games about the Templars you know 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.189

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 most famous games in this field 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.350
 can only be called first templar 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 and knights of the temple here about the second 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.660
 we'll talk more in detail so let's imagine 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.600
 yourself as arpg 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 giants schA see what's in 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.780
 introductory video one crusader 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.969
 sitting behind books 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.980
 reads something and dreams of parallel 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 the world where the purple sky run 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 soldiers runny nose treated by you to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.050
 neurosis torch and naked hairy men 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 are drinking 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.270
 crusader psyches and decides to find three 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.840
 artifact to cope with the world 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 evil is the sword seal and the name of the pepper is called 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.880
 Paul Dirac way doctors say here 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.189
 the plot ends and see us in the final 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.110
 video will be interrupted for a short pause to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 set up management developers decided 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 what the main actions on us go 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 it is very comfortable apparently they thought that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.950
 playing the keyboard is the same as 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.950
 play with the mouse only feet 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:37.760
 dominoes and it turns out to be a game in Russian 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:41.630
 although the entry was in English and he 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:53.750
 only one phrase voiced okay 100 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:59.360

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.430
 released before the approach to buy know 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.740
 I would probably be such a low person 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.440
 traded and generally boring here you 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.290

 kidding something 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.010
 what happened right now let's take it 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.010
 I have not seen this move on 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.450
 yes what the fuck is asked here 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.360
 but it's not funny anymore 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 yes Th you move you 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.849
 in general, all right we won all alive 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.640
 healthy people are happy let's take a last 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:46.209
 the right things yes it was I 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.950
 mind now you already see me in 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.900
 problems when I arrived on one island 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.400
 there are some big freaks throwing in 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.739
 me stones and i will have to shoot out 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.840
 crossbow chic shot 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.120
 all miraculously died from one 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.870
 hits though looked so big 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.840
 scary 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.769
 but go ahead and she has a place apart from the dirt 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:14.349
 three laps or silent killings anna yes 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:16.989
 I am a master of stealth my hello 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.019
 and how I wandered into these labs is not even 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.910
 ask, I didn't want to go here at all 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.729
 everything bad that some mutants nehilo 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.949
 so heading off immediately skip 10 minutes 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.550
 while i beat them and then try 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.550
 Find the way out 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.130
 Well bitch is not what I was looking for open 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.770
 mysterious portal leading incomprehensible 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.169
 where our hero just jumps into him 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.860
 fearless shit of course but it's me 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.930
 all the problems clear up briefly 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:55.760
 boss defeated the first artifact suddenly 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:57.880
 you got that bitch really stupid like 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.730
 you may have a familiar face if i walked 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.530
 until it was not worth it to say perhaps 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.280
 further followed a long way through 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.870
 subway 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.110
 while I killed the guard unexpectedly 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.590
 mutants and another 20 mm were connected 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.990
 give that away then another boss is dead 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.270
 but this little from the city also had to 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.830
 selected most developers did he 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.919
 getting out of dungeon fighting with 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.800
 the guards with mutants killed the boss 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.139
 it means it's time to let the enemies in power and in 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.750
 the port was already waiting for a detachment of ordinary freaks 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.479
 some flying lights as if 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.870
 stolen from the killer pony by the way that is 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.010
 vice versa 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.250
 and a squad of armed zombie ninja kneading 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.669
 was 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.669
 ahirin 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.170
 total we have two artifact last 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.270
 is in the damn city the truth and 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.610
 there was already the beginning but my beauty 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.590
 need to pick up if you try to be 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.300
 as brief as possible then we perform 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.790
 several tasks such as Bring Me the 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.220
 talk to that and go there then 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.930
 we get to the temple where we take the eye further 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.150
 the temple begins to fall apart from it 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.430
 need to run away and as you know in such 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.600
 In cases of fire, rise and stand 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.600
 half a hundred romans 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.740
 I apologize for the bandicam ads and top 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.740
 By the way, I did not know what to register if 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.830
 it's time to go and fight 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.960
 omnipotent demon just don't let me 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.380
 3 grandmothers yagis who want me to give 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.450
 im gold and so obvious 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.090
 I will not give money to the dead in 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.820
 Generally where he says your body to a girl 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.000
 become too weak and you are too strong 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.590
 I possess the wallpaper and you open the gate 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.600
 first go to a speech therapist 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.090
 the demon is defeated around the hero inflames 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:54.380
 the flame and he says if so can i you 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:58.690
 win then let it go and go 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.690
 sleep and this ending 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.700
 what can we say is strange 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.860
 the game is like lpg 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.080
 but in fact the usual is not very high quality 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.750
 slasher there seems to be an open world but 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.270
 there are quests in 5 locations here but 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.210
 strictly type that bring me here 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.280
 There are merchants who fuck not need nor 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.530
 what and did not buy from them here 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.840
 pumping and pumping makes sense unless 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.520
 treatment up from the heap of skills but they are not 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.140
 need nothing at all what else I don't know I 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.350
 sat down to play rpg I looked played 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.300
 linear action that can be judged here 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.940
 enemies here just dohrena judging by 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.160
 statistics for a few hours of yoga 272 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.510
 human 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.510
 these guys are wearing glasses 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.440
 the templar here is harsh almost super 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.990
 the hero conquers all but his 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.060
 can kill the crabs 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.280
 God had to suffer so that 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.220
 go through but thank you for your viewing 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.170
 if you stayed until the end I was going 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:07.240
 do a review did generally complete 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.240
 a short walk up to soon
