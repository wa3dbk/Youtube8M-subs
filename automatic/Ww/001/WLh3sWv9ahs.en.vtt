this this new car it's going to be

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.220 
this this new car it's going to be
interesting<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.630> st.<00:00:34.020> pete

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
interesting i think you know st. pete

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
interesting i think you know st. pete
will<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.680> moment<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> truth<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> where

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
will be the moment of truth as to where

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
will be the moment of truth as to where
all<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> engine<00:00:36.989> manufacturers<00:00:37.680> stack<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
all the engine manufacturers stack up so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
all the engine manufacturers stack up so

fans<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.800> probably<00:00:41.160> more<00:00:41.340> interesting<00:00:41.850> for

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
know it says season opener so I think

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670

all<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> drives<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.110> crazy<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
all the drives are a bit crazy and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
all the drives are a bit crazy and
auntie<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> season<00:01:33.000> started<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
auntie do to get the season started so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
auntie do to get the season started so
it<00:01:33.780> always<00:01:33.960> makes<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.530> racing<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.070> I'm

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it always makes good racing and I'm

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.539 
it always makes good racing and I'm
really<00:01:36.030> looking<00:01:36.150> forward<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.200> pee

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
first reason is because it's the first

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
first reason is because it's the first
