00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.080
 and how about I'm javier prior of 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.640
 apnea training dotcom and good me 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.360
 they have asked a question really 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.839
 really basic and it never occurred to me 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.150
 pose what is like how to compensate 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.220
 how to make the valsalva maneuver how 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.800
 the valsalva maneuver is done is something so 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.560
 simple that I had overlooked 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.480
 but the truth is that many 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.730
 beginners who start in apnea 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.390
 or what starts you and if you are 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.010
 starting in the apnea or are you or 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.240
 you just have your life what are you 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 snorkeling 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.070
 Well, you're interested in learning how to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.840
 makes for the save to go down a bit 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.100
 more to the bottom and learn to lower meters and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 5 meters 7 meters 8 10 and good and that he 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.880
 knows like you can get one day to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 be a great place is fine 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.980
 valsalva maneuver do not you drop to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.300
 depth 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.489
 in the water pressure itself that is 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.550
 many tons and tons every 10 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.170
 meters increases a pressure bar with what 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.690
 what does this mean in what 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.970
 translates to the air in your lungs and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.650
 your ears inside we have air 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 here in our in salts we have air 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 it compresses and the eardrums instead of 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.060
 be straight as they are here in 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.490
 surface do so and if they are supported with 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.210
 what this is beginning to be done 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 elastic with which this hurts us 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.500
 and you have to compensate how you compensate with 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.410
 the valsalva maneuver 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.370
 how the maneuver is done pal saves and it 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.280
 must do before the pain hurts 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.320
 ears of agreement as it is made wind then 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.160
 closed mouth nose covered and painted with 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160
 these two fingers 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.940
 and now we try to blow 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 progressively strong but not 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.390
 sharply 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.080
 according to energy with force but 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.010
 not abruptly snapped in 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.100
 accord slowly and with and with as if 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.080
 you were stepping on the accelerator of a 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.220
 car in agreement then you close the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.600
 Pinch your nose and you're going to blow 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 by the nose in this way 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.970
 will open the ears in this case as 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.250
 they are so they compare themselves outward 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.200
 then they are placed in normal then 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.660
 we are giving and we cover the mouth is 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.660
 to open our nose and blow with david 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.800
 and you will notice how your ears make plop 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.600
 agreement that is to compensate well 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 we counteract the strength that comes from 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.550
 out by the water 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.550
 we counteract it 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.730
 we can continue going down a bit more in the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.670
 water in agreement 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.860
 I have reached a depth a level of 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.750
 depth and to manage that for 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.269
 frida and bears who are fishermen that is 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.370
 at 10 meters and meters for others 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.230
 is at 20 meters for others at 30 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.440
 for others at 70 meters 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.019
 the limit arrives, that is, I can not continue 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.489
 compensating I remember how I can continue 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.459
 compensating good for that is why 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.830
 they use other techniques because valsalva 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.599
 it is no longer valid, because the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.099
 diaphragm is in the lungs have 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.260
 compressed so much that the diaphragm has 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.629
 gone up a lot and we can not do 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.239
 force with the diaphragm to draw air 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.680
 to compensate neither the ears the mask 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 etcetera with which for that it 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.299
 will use another technique that is mouth 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.849
 field we will explain later on 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.379
 agreement so well now what 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.560
 I want you to do is to write a 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.299
 comment here below that you give to 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.750
 button I like to share in 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.030
 facebook and nothing else if you see this 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.390
 video on youtube or any other 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.670
 place 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.560
 go to apnea point training 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.109
 because that's where all the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.359
 community that's where we ask you 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.609
 where we give answers where you are 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.489
 the whole community talking and I invite you to 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.290
 Put your email and see the 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.320
 masterclass there is nothing else to enter 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.160
 and nothing else you have a good day and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.160
 happy speak as
