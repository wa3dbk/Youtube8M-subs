00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to everyone then video to show you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.639
 how do I clean the half points in leather or 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.280
 in fake leather in this case I wear 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.830
 these rhythmic gym shoes 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 which I then use to practice pole 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 dance and as you can see this is already here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 been cleaned you should see it while 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
 this then is practically dirty from a 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 year and a half 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.830
 then how to clean the pits vi 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.769
 you will need two things that you will find 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 certainly in the home of cotton and one 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 makeup remover in this case use 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
 this one from the green shop but it goes 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 well in any cleansing milk also 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.610
 those from the supermarket 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 what must be done then first of all vi 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
 I advise you to put the half tips at 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.690
 foot so it is easier to clean them take 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.980
 a tiny little piece of cotton 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:59.309
 just go and spray 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:04.189
 pamper the detergent or milk 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:09.680
 structuring then almost by magic 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 go clean our half-pointy 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.390
 also the bordeaux you see they want 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.390
 really 5 seconds 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 see this part almost already has it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:34.390
 finished also the bordeaux now I do 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.429
 the tip for the dirtiest part 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.070
 obviously they will never come back like new 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.569
 however, eighty percent are cleaned 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.939
 of dirt goes away 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.939
 see the cotton is getting dirty 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:00.850
 almost done then if you want you can 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.409
 finish all the dirt well 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.229
 here it is 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.470
 This pretty much gone away here 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 skin so not much here 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.180
 it succeeds however for the rest where the skin 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 it wasn't ruined 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.450
 therefore it remained intact without tears and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 returned practically new and nothing 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 as you have seen it is one thing 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 it is very simple to do 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.840
 really half a second 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 I hope this video was there 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.250
 useful and let me know if you will use 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.819
 this method to clean the half tips 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.819
 Hello
