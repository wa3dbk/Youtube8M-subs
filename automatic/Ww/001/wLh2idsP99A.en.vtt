00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
hey everyone so this video is about 4k

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.509 
hey everyone so this video is about 4k
resolution<00:00:08.730> displays<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:10.099> here's<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> deal

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
resolution displays and here's the deal

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.499 
resolution displays and here's the deal
and<00:00:11.880> there's<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> activity<00:00:13.170> around

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
and there's a lot of activity around

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.779 
and there's a lot of activity around
cameras<00:00:15.509> video<00:00:16.170> lately<00:00:16.710> where<00:00:17.130> we're

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
cameras video lately where we're

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.450 
cameras video lately where we're
starting<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.240> move<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> next

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
starting to move up into the next

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
starting to move up into the next
quality<00:00:20.630> level<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.890> imagery<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
quality level of imagery so what that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.019 
quality level of imagery so what that
means<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:25.140> years<00:00:25.350> we've<00:00:25.980> been<00:00:26.430> building

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
means is for years we've been building

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.769 
means is for years we've been building
into<00:00:27.480> using<00:00:28.310> blu-ray<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.580> 1080p<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.570> mean

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
into using blu-ray in 1080p I mean

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.520 
into using blu-ray in 1080p I mean
blu-ray<00:00:31.230> wasn't<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.949> big<00:00:32.489> success<00:00:33.000> but

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
blu-ray wasn't a big success but

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
blu-ray wasn't a big success but
basically<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.920> 1080p<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> current

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
basically the 1080p is the current

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
basically the 1080p is the current
highest<00:00:37.129> resolution<00:00:38.129> available<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
highest resolution available on a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
highest resolution available on a
blu-ray<00:00:39.750> disc<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.579> broadcast<00:00:41.579> TV<00:00:42.800> it's<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
blu-ray disc or broadcast TV it's it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.660 
blu-ray disc or broadcast TV it's it's
really<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> standard<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:47.399> it's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
really the standard right now but it's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
really the standard right now but it's
been<00:00:48.149> around<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> while<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.379> we're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
been around for a while and we're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.900 
been around for a while and we're
starting<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> next

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
starting to you know go into the next

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
starting to you know go into the next
technology<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.050> still<00:00:55.260> pretty<00:00:55.440> far<00:00:55.710> away

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
technology it's still pretty far away

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.760 
technology it's still pretty far away
but<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.340> certain<00:00:56.579> things<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.770> should

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
but there are certain things that should

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.970 
but there are certain things that should
be<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.460> now<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.890> know

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
be here now that I think that you know

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
be here now that I think that you know
they<00:01:02.850> should<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.480> they're<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.719> art

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
they should be here but they're just art

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.969 
they should be here but they're just art
but<00:01:04.729> where<00:01:05.729> am<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> okay<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
but where am I going with that okay so

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
but where am I going with that okay so
here's<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.070> point<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.350> there's<00:01:10.350> all

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
here's my point is that there's all

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.520 
here's my point is that there's all
kinds<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> rumors<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.180> example<00:01:12.530> apples

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
kinds of rumors that for example apples

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.810 
kinds of rumors that for example apples
going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> release<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.540> next<00:01:15.689> iPad<00:01:16.290> 3<00:01:16.920> with

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
going to release the next iPad 3 with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.390 
going to release the next iPad 3 with
the<00:01:17.939> high<00:01:18.090> resolution<00:01:18.390> display<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.650> rumor<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.429 

2048<00:01:23.400> x<00:01:24.200> 1536<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:27.630> very

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
2048 x 1536 and that's basically very

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.630 
2048 x 1536 and that's basically very
close<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.960> 30<00:01:31.259> inch<00:01:31.470> monitors

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
close to what the 30 inch monitors

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
close to what the 30 inch monitors
computer<00:01:32.640> monitors<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.920> before<00:01:34.920> matt

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
computer monitors out there before matt

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.170 
computer monitors out there before matt
today<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.270> 30<00:01:36.780> inch<00:01:36.900> screen<00:01:39.110> from<00:01:40.110> dell<00:01:40.380> from

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
today so a 30 inch screen from dell from

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
today so a 30 inch screen from dell from
apple<00:01:42.180> used<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:43.220> see<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.340> else<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
apple used to have one see what else is

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.840 
apple used to have one see what else is
out<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.270> an<00:01:45.390> HP<00:01:46.399> for<00:01:47.399> example

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
out there there's an HP for example

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
out there there's an HP for example
there's<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> lot<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:49.049> are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
there's not a lot of out there these are

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.219 
there's not a lot of out there these are
kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> expensive<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> ipad<00:01:51.930> 3<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
kind of expensive so this ipad 3 is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
kind of expensive so this ipad 3 is
going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> come<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.009> same<00:01:53.610> level

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
going to come out with this same level

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.139 
going to come out with this same level
of<00:01:54.210> pixel<00:01:55.020> density<00:01:55.710> basically<00:01:56.219> resolution<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
of pixel density basically resolution is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
of pixel density basically resolution is
sent<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.810> only<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.320> 10<00:01:58.799> inch

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
sent it's only going to be in 10 inch

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.499 
sent it's only going to be in 10 inch
screen<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.079> means<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> me<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
screen so what that means to me is that

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
screen so what that means to me is that
computer<00:02:03.509> monitor<00:02:04.140> manufacturers<00:02:04.860> are

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
computer monitor manufacturers are

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
computer monitor manufacturers are
dragging<00:02:05.700> their<00:02:05.729> feet<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:07.259> more

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
dragging their feet there's a lot more

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.960 
dragging their feet there's a lot more
technology<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:10.940> they're<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
technology they can do now they're just

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
technology they can do now they're just
not<00:02:12.270> doing<00:02:12.599> it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
not doing it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.650 
not doing it
there's<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.370> market<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.200> 4k<00:02:15.680> video<00:02:16.660> is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
there's a market there so 4k video is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.100 
there's a market there so 4k video is
starting<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.590> come<00:02:18.770> out<00:02:18.800> where<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.930> know<00:02:21.050> you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
starting to come out where you know you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.700 
starting to come out where you know you
may<00:02:21.320> have<00:02:21.440> heard<00:02:21.590> about<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.980> Canon<00:02:22.550> EOS

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
may have heard about the Canon EOS

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.950 
may have heard about the Canon EOS
camera<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:25.640> launched<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.390> fall<00:02:26.960> 2011

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
camera that was launched in fall 2011

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.380 
camera that was launched in fall 2011
that<00:02:29.960> still<00:02:30.200> outputs<00:02:30.650> at<00:02:30.770> 1080p<00:02:31.070> but<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that still outputs at 1080p but it can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.090 
that still outputs at 1080p but it can
capture<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.870> guess<00:02:33.110> at<00:02:33.320> 4k<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:35.050> then<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.950> may

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
capture I guess at 4k and then you may

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.940 
capture I guess at 4k and then you may
have<00:02:37.220> heard<00:02:37.370> about<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.880> red<00:02:38.710> company<00:02:39.710> that

have heard about the red company that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.180 
have heard about the red company that
makes<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:41.140> gnarly<00:02:42.140> custom<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.920> there<00:02:43.070> are<00:02:43.160> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
makes a gnarly custom but there are a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.310 
makes a gnarly custom but there are a
smaller<00:02:43.580> manufacturer<00:02:44.390> cameras<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.080> shoot

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
smaller manufacturer cameras that shoot

it<00:02:45.440> 4k<00:02:46.070> video<00:02:47.080> go<00:02:48.080> out<00:02:48.170> there<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.440> look<00:02:48.620> at

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
it 4k video go out there and look at

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.830 
it 4k video go out there and look at
Vimeo<00:02:49.190> or<00:02:49.250> some<00:02:49.760> other<00:02:49.850> websites<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.600> think

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
Vimeo or some other websites I think

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.510 
Vimeo or some other websites I think
even<00:02:50.960> on<00:02:51.170> YouTube<00:02:51.560> here<00:02:51.860> they<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.280> some

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
even on YouTube here they have some

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.760 
even on YouTube here they have some
examples<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.240> 4k<00:02:53.720> video<00:02:54.050> using<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> red

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.830 
examples of 4k video using the red
cameras<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.240> absolutely<00:02:56.720> amazing

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
cameras it's just absolutely amazing

cameras it's just absolutely amazing
they<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.620> shoot<00:02:57.890> slow-motion<00:02:59.770> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
they can shoot slow-motion and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.020 
they can shoot slow-motion and
completely<00:03:02.480> high<00:03:02.750> res<00:03:03.110> screens<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.430> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
completely high res screens it's the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
completely high res screens it's the
images<00:03:05.360> rather<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:07.100> we're<00:03:07.370> getting<00:03:08.270> into<00:03:08.570> an

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
images rather so we're getting into an

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.200 
images rather so we're getting into an
area<00:03:09.320> where<00:03:09.680> we're<00:03:10.490> getting<00:03:10.580> ready<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.910> change

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
area where we're getting ready to change

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.730 
area where we're getting ready to change
technology<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:12.710> other<00:03:12.920> thing<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.190> that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
technology the other thing is that

the<00:03:24.610> image<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.880> picture<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:27.110> image<00:03:27.320> capture

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the image of a picture the image capture

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.320 
the image of a picture the image capture
is<00:03:28.120> basically<00:03:29.120> always<00:03:29.750> larger<00:03:30.380> than<00:03:31.330> if

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
is basically always larger than if

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.900 
is basically always larger than if
you're<00:03:32.600> shooting<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.990> RAW<00:03:33.460> larger<00:03:34.460> than<00:03:34.670> any

computer monitor out there that can show
it<00:03:38.900> natively<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.710> it<00:03:39.860> can<00:03:40.130> shrink<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.430> down<00:03:40.490> and

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
it natively so it can shrink it down and

it natively so it can shrink it down and
you're<00:03:41.930> kind<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.500> seeing<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.800> scrunch
