do<00:04:34.030> is<00:04:34.300> split<00:04:34.509> it<00:04:34.659> into<00:04:34.749> two<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.379> take<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> small

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
do is split it into two and take a small

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.369 
do is split it into two and take a small
section<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.789> each<00:04:36.969> side<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.629> bring<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:38.229> the

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
section of each side and bring it to the

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.959 
section of each side and bring it to the
other<00:04:38.529> so<00:04:38.889> just<00:04:39.099> keep<00:04:39.279> repeating<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.819> step

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
other so just keep repeating this step

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.300 
other so just keep repeating this step
