00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.799
 hi guys i was cangiano today 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.580
 I want to present you my new one 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.630
 jewel called mass of caster 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.700
 this guitar the fruit of one 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.759
 collaboration with the luthier david 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.730
 sorrentino who realized this for me 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.189
 tool according to my specification vi 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.770
 I say how the guitar is made then the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.610
 body of the guitar and made of ash 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.780
 of the marshes are called one touch and ed 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.590
 it is a unique piece 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.629
 as you can see I also liked the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.780
 made of a satin varnish 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.989
 so good david satisfied me 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.199
 as regards instead the handle the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.859
 handle and totally in eye maple 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.280
 lee born and rosewood fingerboard 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:01.429
 one thing in particular of the handle and that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.010
 does not know is not the classic handle from 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.900
 fender but actually has all the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.030
 features of a gibson handle in 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.830
 this case taken the measures presented 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.799
 from 35 of the Gibson 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.640
 so we have Romanesque serlet than in 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.159
 radius own of a pigtail also 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.320
 as you can see I made him put 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.390
 the pick up of the first pick up to the handle e 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.250
 a burger that always does the word 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.810
 luthiers for the Florentines 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.860
 in short, he does it by hand and a maker who 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.760
 with respect to all the features of 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.300
 a classic paschi must be Romanesque 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.360
 while the central pick up is typically 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.720
 head with a stratocaster piccard flavor 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.550
 allowed the bridge is really typical 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.010
 these are the telecaster configurations 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.790
 in first position we have the whole 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.650
 anvier in second position we have one 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.320
 anpaca coil exactly of the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.619
 upper coil plus central pickup 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.840
 put in counter-phase in third position 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.890
 we have a central epic in the fourth 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 position 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.600
 we have a central pick up and pick up at 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.940
 then his bridge was put in phase 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.080
 the 24 are classics 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.080
 stratocaster and as last sound we have 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.610
 the typical sound of a bridge 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.150
 telecaster now I can listen to you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 in my beautiful galileo thibaut mark 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 I hope you like it with valves
