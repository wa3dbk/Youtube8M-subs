 today we are going to make a video 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.050
 differently take it into account what I 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.810

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.400

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.010
 let's talk about my purchases of the month of 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.140
 April are accessible products that 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.529
 you can find in any store 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.150
 cosmetics and they have very good quality and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.499
 the truth is that they invented me more part 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 is that he insisted on knowing what they are 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.119
 only stay with me and let's see 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.750
 the first node I'm going to show you is the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.750
 medicaid cyclin which is a cream 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 illuminating corrector moisturizing in addition 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.840
 which contains sunscreen illuminate and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.390
 others more benefits than not less 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.079
 I learned but the truth is that I liked it 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.989
 because you can not give dry faces not you 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.780
 will leave that feeling as well as totally 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.629
 mate and me is what I like that will be 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.700
 the luminous skin writes to the natural as 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.190
 if I did not bring 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.040
 It has a lot of coverage 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.080
 and it has a long duration I do not know if the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.530
 can you use for the whole day you have seen me 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 enough if you use it with the prime 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.710
 before it lasts much longer than 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 performs a better finish well too 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.720
 acquire the pallets of abarán of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 correctors and what I liked about these 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 similar to part of its content is that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 the lady this activity of correcting 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.310
 Your specific pigmentations 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.340
 tricks that come in different colors 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.130
 well I'm going to leave you a video months ago 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.260
 of how to correct then as the link 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.680
 in the description of the video and from here to 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.250
 when at the bottom and also I 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 they liked because the concealer that comes 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.490
 it's not the dry but it has a little 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 of grasita what makes you can 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.470
 distribute pretty well and that's what I 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 I look for correctors I have 15 kos 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.260
 because the area of ​​my eyes 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.990
 very close then when applied 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.929
 Very very dry correctors that do not 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.150
 they hydrate and they leave me like that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.850
 quartered and these contain that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.440
 characteristic a long time ago that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.750
 I really wanted to buy a blush 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.610
 in this tone and although it seems to you 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.760
 too strange because it's too much 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.520
 dark for me I quite like that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.580
 I have put everything depends on the quantity 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.090
 of gel office and with which you apply it is 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.950
 the number 18 and external rest in the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530
 video of the spring trends that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.160
 I showed you in the previous video 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.750
 we talked about the illuminators 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.290
 Ivan though better than having a shadow 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.060
 in your pocket that is more in that they are 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.569
 simply illuminating as to 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.069
 bring it every day 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.849
 you can not use the room in the 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.489
 animated and to follow illuminations in 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.950
 I really liked the face because it's 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.159
 small the practice of 30 extra as 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.269
 to have the petticoats every day 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.760
 another thing that they are very 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.500
 demanding with eyeliner pencils and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.440
 is that the truth is that there was 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.800
 found one that will last me 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.590
 more than an hour without it to run and it's 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.180
 because my skin is fat then you 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.710
 segregating itself by adding then the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.930
 makeup starts to run that 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.390
 I found an eyeliner is from time to 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.630
 the sicam brand and he had already 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.610
 shown in other videos and it's the tone 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.740
 coffee and I'm really surprised that I do not know 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.390
 I happened to a top part of 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.970
 back then later in this 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.430
 month they removed the eyeliner foresee white 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.040
 and good 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.930
 because the truth is that it lasts long if 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.540
 You can buy it I recommend it 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.939
 enough that it's electric is called 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.579
 paul eyeliner for eyes blur 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.890
 bring a rubber band so that it diffuses is the 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.109
 delineador this remains one of our fifth 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.849
 and father, I really like doing it with 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.340
 banders cafes or with due 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.069
 resguardos and it's a very fast way of 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.569
 Make-up without using shadows and good 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.969
 Now that we are fashionable with the bags 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.880
 in the channel wants to recommend now 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:20.509
 eta is a special brush with shadow 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.550
 I liked it because the hair that it has is 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.370
 very compact then it helps you apply 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.630
 the shadows and that you do not fall 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.030
 pigments and stains the quality is good 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.360
 despite price and pressure put as 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.009
 approximately 20 pesos although I saw it in 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.550
 other places at 12 pesos that is 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.010
 too cheap 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.490
 had previously used one of 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.930
 but I did not like it that much but 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.420
 these are two the truth is also very 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.780
 I recommend it pretty good with 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.310
 reading center is this lipstick of 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.230
 adhara the truth that I like very much 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.300
 the lips of giving because in addition to having 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.000
 very good imitations of last quite long 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.090
 time are we create sites and they are 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.120
 economic and finally acquire a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.310
 Eyelash mask is called 4 linen 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.140
 surely you have already seen it has a 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.690
 previously civil about 20 pesos 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.390
 or less the truth I did not like 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.370
 because I'm running a lot, I think 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.270
 I'm running for my oily skin that I 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.150
 It runs a lot but it had done very 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.800
 good patient reviews from three friends 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.009
 they used it and the truth is they 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.550
 I looked perfect but the truth 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:35.159
 and I liked it right now if every skin is 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.349
 different and maybe what I have left 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.569
 well, it does not look good on you or what does 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.029
 it looks good maybe I do not like the 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.729
 wind but good the important thing is 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.939

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.259
