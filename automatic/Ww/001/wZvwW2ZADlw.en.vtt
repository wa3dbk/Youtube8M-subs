better way to actually get it
incorporated<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.189> well<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.390> make

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
incorporated as well and then make

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.039 
incorporated as well and then make
patties<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.570> go<00:01:54.570> ahead<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.930> make

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
patties out of it and go ahead and make

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
patties out of it and go ahead and make
your<00:01:55.140> burgers<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> we'll<00:01:56.549> go

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
your burgers out of it and we'll go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670 
your burgers out of it and we'll go
ahead<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.290> I'll<00:01:58.560> show

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
ahead do that right now and I'll show

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.719 
ahead do that right now and I'll show
you<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> looks<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> link<00:01:59.460> rough

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729

ground<00:02:02.729> chuck<00:02:02.969> patty<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.899> made<00:02:04.170> up

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
ground chuck patty is actually made up

ground chuck patty is actually made up
formed<00:02:04.710> made<00:02:05.040> some<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.399> big<00:02:05.640> patty<00:02:05.880> series

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
formed made some pretty big patty series

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.869 
formed made some pretty big patty series
and<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.829> ground<00:02:08.250> beef<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.729> want

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and because it is ground beef you want

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.859 
and because it is ground beef you want
to<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:09.030> sure<00:02:09.060> you're<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.450> getting<00:02:09.690> any<00:02:09.840> a

coli or anything like that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.589 
coli or anything like that
to<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.579> sure<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:17.150> cooking<00:02:18.150> these<00:02:18.209> ground

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
to make sure you're cooking these ground

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.929 
to make sure you're cooking these ground

middle a lot of people leave these these

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.009

kind<00:02:26.159> of<00:02:26.189> patties<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.599> know<00:02:27.720> when<00:02:27.900> they're

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
kind of patties you know when they're

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.179 
kind of patties you know when they're

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
essentially raw in the middle but not

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.619 
essentially raw in the middle but not
worth<00:02:32.459> taking<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> chances<00:02:33.359> on<00:02:33.480> getting

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
worth taking the chances on getting

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.910 
worth taking the chances on getting
really<00:02:33.989> really<00:02:34.079> sick<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:37.319> know<00:02:37.439> mine<00:02:37.769> will

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
really really sick so you know mine will

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.670 
really really sick so you know mine will
have<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> little<00:02:38.400> bit<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.519> char<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.030> outside

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
have a little bit of char on the outside

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.110 
have a little bit of char on the outside
but<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.099> inside<00:02:41.189> they'll<00:02:41.819> be<00:02:41.909> nice<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
but on the inside they'll be nice and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.890 
but on the inside they'll be nice and
done<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:43.200> still<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.650> juicy<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.720> these<00:02:45.840> are
