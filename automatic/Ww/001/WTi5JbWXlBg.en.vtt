00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 she left me with the fact that they were 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 the owners of the name good as they 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.420
 they are the owners of the evil I am eighth 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.130
 since 1989 I myself was on the council 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 world when I was already a star 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.420
 that he already edited and peña came to work at 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 world council we agreed 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 to triple and I took the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 people for us to do a business 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.170
 new a new dream that stops for me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 I had very good things this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.060
 that's what we did triple-a in 92 of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 where do I get that they own 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.710
 of the name some name that I took 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 toño peña he see wanted to give the name 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 de facto and I told him that I did not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.760
 like to see if it does not speak that I wanted the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 octagon name because I was a before 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 martial artist and I was a fan of chuck norris 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 and de bruce reads a movie that you've 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 made one newly a suspension bridge 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 there it stayed very engraved to me for that is 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 that I get on the ropes and I run in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.940
 the ropes making a resemblance of what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 that a loris has been made in his movie 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 but I think you were sad sadder 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 is that I am the year because the year passed to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.949
 half realize that toño peña has 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 registered my name without giving them movies without 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 without telling me anything a name that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 it corresponded to him being my friend and my 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.960
 compadre I am very upset and very sad 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 at the same time as a person who 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 supposedly we were family and that I 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.229
 have done those kind of hauls that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 now it has consequences because it is not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.580
 Toño Peña 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.619
 cried today I tell them their truths and I 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.509
 he gives it but this company this family 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 peña marisela waghare and dorian si 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.440
 They want me to come with something that is not 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 it's very unfair to me, that's why it's 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.020
 I popped this demand if in the case of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.550
 author who is called nullity of the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.340
 reasoned of the rights of use 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.000
 exclusive of the name 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.729
 then I already present from 1989 until 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.179
 the 2014 2015 2016 2015 all everything but it's 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.670
 a plane stopped all those years then 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.719
 I want them to present the papers 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.610
 from the 92 back 91 90 89 that are 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.380
 the ones that I presented to see if it's true 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.030
 that they are the ones since they have 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.039
 the rights of the name and that they are 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.899
 the owners of the name for those who do not 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.220
 we are familiar with this 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.840
 legal situation what does this mean 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.090
 document and in what position it puts 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.450
 triple-to the gut they put it that is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.590
 liar they have of them as 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.840
 anyone anyone who 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.650
 have mind or put a demand put it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.569
 if you have the right by law to appeal what 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.790
 they have 15 days to answer me 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.010
 that they do not have the papers and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.310
 all 1900 I want to know where 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.160
 because if I did triple in 92 they 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.870
 they can not have anything since 89 for 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.489
 so for back 89 90 91 up to 92 it's 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 greater in laments we made triple 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.970
 then I am I have all and that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.680
 documentation 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
 I have the subway song that big 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.080
 three times the movies we wanted and I 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.220
 I have royalties I still receive royalties 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.120
 of the anda de la andi I think that I 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.130
 I have my fighter license since 1989 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.400
 this many things that I presented to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.260
 injector why is that proceeds or is 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.660
 this demand comes that I am 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.070
 getting in if I did not have 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.810
 all the necessary papers 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.420
 I'm immediately thrown back 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.880
 but already the director rogelio rivera gave 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.310
 the gave gave cleared because I 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.310
 I presented everything that I have and so 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.500
 So much they are entitled to 15 days 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.480
 to defend ourselves let's see what jalada 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.580
 they are going to leave now but if I can 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 I'm going to allow if they remove me 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.700
 what is a member you have had 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.940
 contact or has met with people from 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.500
 triple-a nothing for nothing or want to be 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.930
 with only one person that I could have 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.459
 He was sitting with Tono, he's not here anymore 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.890
 also very sad and very very very 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.290
 disappointed that it was because I do not 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.270
 I have registered my name when I did not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.030
 corresponded I think that 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.340
 that this has not been my friend my 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.560
 compadre saddens me a lot 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.960
 made a pull of this magnitude and that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.600
 now it is not if it had gone to 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.300
 scream your things to confirm the fault 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.770
 in favor of octagon that they continue for their 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.540
 career will continue as independent of 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.280
 look for the world council as the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.750
 independent plane I think that I already 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.420
 I left a company that I'm so many 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.600
 years and I know that there's a lot 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.520
 work either and rapprochement with the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.140
 mister alonso but with the league he and I 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.330
 I think there's no need to be in 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.850
 a company I think we can be 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.190
 independent work wherever and 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.990
 can work with the council of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.240
 world council I can work and start 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.190
 there are many there is a lot of work in the USA 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.100
 I think there's a lot of fabric from where 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.420
 cut and prove to triple-a yes that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.670
 they got that the least person 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.200
 indicated that is conduct talking about 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.850
 these kinds of situations did you speak 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.730
 also from the creation of a union 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.440
 there are already wrestlers already interested 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.420
 involved in this as how it progresses 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.700
 issues and what happens is that the union 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.010
 of the city stopped them from having strength 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.180
 because if you do not have union members then 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.490
 lose strength 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.840
 to us but right now what happened 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.150
 unfortunately puppy color 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.130
 account then this touched many 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.130
 sensitivities in government so much 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.310
 deputies senators like many people 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.370
 important then we are interested as 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.630
 for getting the card many of the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.530
 companions that we are in the legends 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.690
 of wrestling 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.280
 we are very interested in activating the 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.650
 union for the wrestlers 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.090
 let's have a guarantee the green struggle 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.340
 has a guarantee to get on a 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.050
 ring that is therefore only not afraid in what 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.539
 unless you have social security 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.940
 and have the indispensable that you have 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.590
 already have an ambulance that has 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.210
 first aid I think all that 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.070
 the important thing I would say to the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.720
 wrestlers that are obviously the most 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.280
 unprotected to integrate this 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.990
 union those who join me I think 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.400
 what do you know about the octagon path 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.259
 he knows that I did not know a person 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.110
 them all my life I've seen by the 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.729
 comrades for my fellow fighters 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.190
 They know the quality of by sagrera de 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.990
 I believe that here is the time to 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.580
 that they turn to us join 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.039
 us and they're going to see that we're going to have 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.930
 many gains many benefits for 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.479
 all the fighters tell you that 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.820
 We are on the warpath if 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.860
 unfortunately a detonation so 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.199
 big as the puppy's death 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.840
 came to give that we were very 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.789
 annoying but hopefully and turn to see 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.600
 do not become aware and they will see that 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.600
 we are going to be very successful
