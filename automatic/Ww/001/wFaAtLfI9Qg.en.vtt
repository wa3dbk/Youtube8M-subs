first is make sure your first couple

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
first is make sure your first couple
missions<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.930> create<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.070> mission

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
missions you create you use a mission

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
missions you create you use a mission

with all the basic pieces kind of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
with all the basic pieces kind of
pre-wired<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> running

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
for this demo we're gonna choose a kill

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830 
for this demo we're gonna choose a kill
em<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.350> mission<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.450> simply

let's talk about two of the most

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
let's talk about two of the most
important<00:00:52.949> logic<00:00:53.250> boxes<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
important logic boxes you can see here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.250 
important logic boxes you can see here
the<00:00:54.390> first<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the first is this one with the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
the first is this one with the
headphones<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.190> blue<00:00:56.340> square

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
headphones in the little blue square

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
headphones in the little blue square
that's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> monitor<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.020> actually

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's a monitor and it's actually

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
that's a monitor and it's actually
monitoring<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> members<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.090> group

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
monitoring all the members of the group

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
monitoring all the members of the group
that<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.930> blue<00:01:01.260> squares<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:01.800> their<00:01:01.920> head

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that have blue squares over their head

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
that have blue squares over their head
ie<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.640> two<00:01:02.820> bad<00:01:03.030> guys<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.960> select

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
ie the two bad guys and when we select

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
ie the two bad guys and when we select
this<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.680> you'll<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.280> text

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this thing you'll see the little text

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
this thing you'll see the little text
pops<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.510> describes<00:01:06.990> what's<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.710> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pops up and describes what's going on in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
pops up and describes what's going on in
that<00:01:07.979> monitor<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> adjust<00:01:09.299> what

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that monitor and you can adjust what

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
that monitor and you can adjust what
it's<00:01:09.840> monitoring<00:01:10.229> whether<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.830> counts<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it's monitoring whether it's counts of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's monitoring whether it's counts of
people<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.540> whatever's<00:01:12.990> happened<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.350> this

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
people or whatever's happened in this

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.600 
people or whatever's happened in this
case<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.130> wait<00:01:14.280> till<00:01:14.460> they're<00:01:14.580> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
case we just wait till they're all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.170 
case we just wait till they're all
killed<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.810> incapacitated<00:01:16.670> okay<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
killed or incapacitated okay so now the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
killed or incapacitated okay so now the
second<00:01:18.630> important<00:01:19.080> logic<00:01:19.979> box<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> an

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
second important logic box here is an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.390 
second important logic box here is an
object<00:01:21.000> modifier<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.799> box<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> kind<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
object modifier and this box is kind of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
object modifier and this box is kind of
a<00:01:23.460> heart<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.729> soul<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> ugc<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.990> set

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a heart and soul of ugc you can set

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
a heart and soul of ugc you can set
properties<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.040> almost<00:01:26.400> any<00:01:26.640> object<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.210> group

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
properties on almost any object or group

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
properties on almost any object or group
of<00:01:27.540> objects<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> system<00:01:28.579> again<00:01:29.579> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
of objects in the system again we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
of objects in the system again we're
using<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> blue<00:01:30.479> group<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> identify<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
using the blue group to identify the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
using the blue group to identify the
people<00:01:32.280> who<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.000> modified<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
people who are gonna get modified and we

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.920 
people who are gonna get modified and we
can<00:01:33.869> set<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.380> action<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.920> want<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> do

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
can set what action we want them to do

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
can set what action we want them to do
what<00:01:36.930> areas<00:01:37.409> they're<00:01:37.590> allowed<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.400> what

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
what areas they're allowed to go in what

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
what areas they're allowed to go in what
their<00:01:39.000> range<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.500> case

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
their range can be and in this case

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.249 
their range can be and in this case
we're<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.220> setting<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.540> attack<00:01:42.840> whole

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
we're just setting them to attack whole

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.319 
we're just setting them to attack whole
when<00:01:43.950> their<00:01:44.130> input<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> triggered<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.030> we

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
when their input is triggered and we

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:45.770 
when their input is triggered and we
have<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
have a
little<00:01:45.990> monitor<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> triggers<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little monitor that triggers that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.240 
little monitor that triggers that
admissions<00:01:47.790> start<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:49.979> we're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.190> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
admissions start so now we're going to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.920 
admissions start so now we're going to

save it and give it a play and sure
enough<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> mission<00:01:52.530> starts<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> guys

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
enough is the mission starts the guys
