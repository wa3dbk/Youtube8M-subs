00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:10.700
 Hello, today I want 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:13.370
 introduce you to the module and one 327 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 this module 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.010
 designed to diagnose your 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.010
 the car 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.780
 standard is used upd2 connection by 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.260
 bluetooth 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.520
 Specifically, here I use as what 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.520
 diagnostic method 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.989
 installed the application on android auto 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.809
 doctor in pdf fag and use it 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.629
 The application has already four cars about 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.800
 diagnosed in principle everything that I am on 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.000
 all correctly shows specifically here 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.180
 for frets grants are you thinking about 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.080
 diagnostics frets grants will need this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.729
 connect diagnostic module 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.110
 connector 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.110
 here is located below 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.880
 near the stove 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.000
 antoxa charge even stove not 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 blocking everything is fine air flow 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.940
 passes up to treat it 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.560
 run the application 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 turn on the pd 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.799
 now connected via bluetooth 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.799
 looking for a suitable pro 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.070
 all protocol 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.530
 burning 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 asks to disable gps you do not need it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.020
 we look at the dynamic parameter 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.509
 can be here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 watch the cooling temperature 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.840
 fluids are acceptable now and we are on 5 75 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840
 degrees 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.290
 speed with steel car 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.290
 ignition timing 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.540
 fluid temperature 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.410
 how much 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.430
 average fuel consumption 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.000
 voltage level can look 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 overall so even 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.849
 diagnostic trouble codes night 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.690
 you can even diagnostic codes 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.700
 problems see this whole program 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.700
 good work out all shows 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.810
 so here's why the wind she doesn't 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.810
 shows cars 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.500
 good program in principle 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.480
 combined with this module everything is fine 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.269
 works 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.269
 use all thanks for it
