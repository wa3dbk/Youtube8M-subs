it makes everything possible with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
it makes everything possible with
anything<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.390> risk<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> reward<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.560> an<00:01:49.740> equal

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
anything the risk and reward is an equal
balance<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> reward<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.950> really

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
balance so if the reward is really

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429

really<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.450> risk<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.869> also<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> be

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
really good the risk is also going to be

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
really good the risk is also going to be

as safely as I possibly can because I
like<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.019> fly<00:02:32.170> close<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> ground<00:02:32.739> I'll<00:02:33.010> do

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
like to fly close to the ground I'll do

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.309 
like to fly close to the ground I'll do
it<00:02:33.580> only<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.330> places<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.780> know<00:02:34.870> very<00:02:35.170> well

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
it only in places that I know very well

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.710 
it only in places that I know very well
and<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:36.760> start<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.120> understand<00:02:37.480> how<00:02:37.659> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
and I start to understand how the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.300 
and I start to understand how the
weather<00:02:37.930> works<00:02:38.170> there<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.500> understand<00:02:39.129> where

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
weather works there I understand where

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.640 
weather works there I understand where
the<00:02:39.430> wind<00:02:39.810> typically<00:02:40.810> goes<00:02:41.019> down<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> valley

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
the wind typically goes down the valley

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.039 
the wind typically goes down the valley
where<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.129> typically<00:02:42.400> comes<00:02:42.549> across<00:02:42.989> how<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
where it typically comes across how the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.399 
where it typically comes across how the
shadows<00:02:44.590> affect<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.730> air<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.930> all<00:02:47.170> of

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
shadows affect the air and with all of

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.369 
shadows affect the air and with all of
that<00:02:47.560> I'm<00:02:48.459> able<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.849> make<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:50.049> very<00:02:50.319> good

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
that I'm able to make a very good

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.050 
that I'm able to make a very good
judgement<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.459> put<00:02:51.610> myself<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.970> this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
judgement if I put myself in this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.699 
judgement if I put myself in this
situation<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.810> part<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> mountain<00:02:53.379> I

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
situation on this part of the mountain I

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.229 
situation on this part of the mountain I
know<00:02:53.769> how<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.640> go<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.000> know<00:02:55.060> how

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
know how it's going to go and I know how

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.059 
know how it's going to go and I know how
it's<00:02:55.360> going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.569> feel<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.140> I'm<00:02:56.620> confident

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
it's going to feel and I'm confident

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.110 
it's going to feel and I'm confident
that<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.310> gonna<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.489> able<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.940> safely

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that I'm gonna be able to do it safely

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.530 
that I'm gonna be able to do it safely
because<00:02:58.840> I've<00:02:58.930> done<00:02:59.049> my<00:02:59.140> homework<00:03:01.019> ok<00:03:02.579> 3<00:03:03.579> 2<00:03:03.609> 1

because I've done my homework ok 3 2 1
yeah

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.530 

so<00:03:14.400> when<00:03:14.519> I'm<00:03:14.610> planning<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:14.969> flight<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.360> have

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
so when I'm planning a flight I have

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.160 
so when I'm planning a flight I have
option<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.469> B<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.799> C<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:18.269> always<00:03:18.420> go<00:03:18.750> and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
option a B and C and I always go and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.759 
option a B and C and I always go and
safest<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:21.269> moderately<00:03:21.989> dangerous<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.590> most

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
safest to moderately dangerous the most

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.490 
safest to moderately dangerous the most
dangerous<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.659> it's<00:03:24.659> important<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.109> do<00:03:25.319> these

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
dangerous and it's important to do these

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
dangerous and it's important to do these
options<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.609> order<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.299> if<00:03:27.689> you<00:03:27.780> don't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
options in that order and if you don't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.360 
options in that order and if you don't
plan<00:03:28.170> on<00:03:28.230> doing<00:03:28.650> those<00:03:28.829> options<00:03:29.159> in<00:03:29.280> that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
plan on doing those options in that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.589 
plan on doing those options in that
order<00:03:30.260> you're<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.439> get<00:03:31.590> focused<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.599> the

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
order you're going to get focused on the

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.030 
order you're going to get focused on the
line<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.079> had<00:03:34.230> envisioned<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
line that you had envisioned the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
line that you had envisioned the
dangerous<00:03:35.430> line<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.939> is<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.480> most<00:03:36.689> exciting

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
dangerous line that is the most exciting

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.500 
dangerous line that is the most exciting
and<00:03:38.159> I've<00:03:38.730> seen<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:38.970> happen<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.359> people

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
and I've seen this happen to people

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.039 
and I've seen this happen to people
where<00:03:40.280> they<00:03:41.280> start<00:03:41.579> going<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.329> option<00:03:42.750> C

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
where they start going for this option C

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.250 
where they start going for this option C
and<00:03:43.400> then<00:03:44.750> something<00:03:45.750> doesn't<00:03:45.989> go<00:03:46.079> exactly

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
