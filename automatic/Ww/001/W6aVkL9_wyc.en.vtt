00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.500
 99 good day my name is flavio and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 this is our review for iphone 5 s us 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 yes have all three models there and indeed 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.269
 the white the space gray what used to be 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.560
 black and the popular golden 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.300
 otherwise, apart from the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.410
 Outwardly, not so much color is done 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660
 sees the big similarities to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 iphone 5 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.480
 because you do not see that big the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 apart from course of the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 homebutton is new now 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.789
 not just not a symbol anymore 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 in there but also a metal ring and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.450
 touch id is installed in the display 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.500
 is quite similar to the iPhone 5 is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.350
 has 1136 x 640 pixels and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 the same pixeldichte me 326 ppi 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 It is still a very good display 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 So you can see it in the bright 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 backlight so in the sun for 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.340
 example still right from all sides 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.899
 Well 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.430
 the resolution is perfectly adequate 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.780
 and the reaction time is really not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 bad 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 some also want the iphone 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.129
 maybe a bigger display that is 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.469
 now again only 4 inches 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.699
 but as long as the battery is not on 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 it will become a bit more powerful 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.250
 probably nothing bigger than that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.769
 Of course, displays also need more 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.049
 Power and more power means bigger batteries 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 and that means thicker iphones and of 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.439
 thick iphones and ever appliances in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.729
 the next generation get fatter 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.080
 Do not leave as the fan of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.580
 that means we need only 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.439
 more powerful batteries before we 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.939
 bigger displays from apple get that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.100
 iphone 5 point now in the lte 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.560
 nets of vodafone and o2 while that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 iPhone 5 is still limited to the telecom 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 As far as the reception was concerned, as well 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.509
 there is no nfc in there other than you 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 might have previously thought 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 offer instead and of course 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 bluetooth and wlan in all sorts 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.689
 configurations and so on inside 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.060
 iphone 5 it beats an apple a7 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.079
 the new processor with 64 bit 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.729
 architecture accompanied by 13 ghz dualcore 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.960
 he is from a m7 core 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 processor mainly for the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 processing of the movement data 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.329
 that means he does everything 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 what the gyro sensor is the motion sensor 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.390
 the proximity sensor and the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.280
 provide acceleration sensor to data 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.240
 which are processed by the m7 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.189
 is a bit smaller a bit 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.770
 saves energy and helps with the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.450
 diminish the performance of the a7 bit 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.799
 and a bit of work to lose weight and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 this of course to save battery 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.310
 the m7 can also differentiate 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.660
 between movements by car on foot 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.850
 so that he too 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.440
 navigation instructions 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.330
 the apple card app according to the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.630
 adapt to your own means of transport 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.850
 can 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.650
 We also have one on the a7 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.420
 high security area 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.040
 All data is stored with the touch 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.990
 sensor to be included that is also called 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
 fingerprints are right on the 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.560
 processor in a very safe extra 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.910
 secured area and secured 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.020
 saved so they germinate 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.490
 can be read 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.320
 the tatsche the data become natural 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.550
 also not sent to somehow already 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.170
 not at the cloud and not at all 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.490
 Apple and also no app developers 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.010
 and nobody will ever stay up 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.170
 a device as I said the apple is a7 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.610
 a 64 bit processor that means he can 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.350
 not just more than four gigabytes 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 process memory is that 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.990
 For now , not for us here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.070
 important because the iphone probably 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.470
 anyway, only one gigabyte again 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.630
 he has also in the memory 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.400
 allow several operations at the same time 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.900
 I want to process that in and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.610
 benchmark results 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.020
 We picked it out for you 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.460
 Just click here on the link and 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.710
 then you come to our benchmark 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.850
 results for the iphone 5 it before 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.290
 all the comparison with desktop 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.310
 Processors such as the mac mini 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.840
 is pretty interesting 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.330
 It is important to know that if 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.600
 at the same time 64 bit prepared apps 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.370
 and 32 bit apps on the iphone are then 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.810
 Both need scaffolding for the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 processing this app data loaded 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.990
 and the iphone will not 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.970
 really slow but the performance 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.190
 is not as it could be first 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.570
 if only 64 bit apps on the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.000
 iphone then it is at his 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.020
 full power arrived in 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.850
 unfortunately you can not do that right now 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.740
 properly recognize whether an app is 32bit or 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.180
 64bit is but the developers can 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.370
 update your apps fairly easily 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.690
 that's pretty easy with ex code 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.980
 says apple and then should 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.270
 probably all apps soon on too 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.220
 be the 64 bit 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.410
 in the iphone 5 it is also a new battery 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 namely with 1570 milliamp hours 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.090
 instead of the iphone 5440 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.880
 milli-hour, according to Apple , that means 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.740
 that you get 250 hours standby until 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.230
 to ten hours 3g talk time eight 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.370
 hours of surfing and some hours of video 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.750
 and play music 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.420
 with us it turned out that that 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.590
 iphone not quite two days 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.090
 holds if you use it properly 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.770
 but probably as before 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.780
 only a whole day and then it on 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.450
 back to the charger at the end of the day 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.030
 Plug id is one of the well 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.620
 biggest news in the iphone 5 it like 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.239
 already said down here in the home 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.770
 button is the sensor in there and you can 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.530
 So unlock the iphone 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.520
 You can also use it in the apple store 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.449
 shopping 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.800
 and the whole thing really works 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.500
 pretty good if set up now 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.819
 you can see how that works here 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.169
 then you can call the phone relatively 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.729
 easy with all fingers when it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.960
 be sure to unlock 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.430
 actually only five are provided 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.050
 different fingers but we have too 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.520
 a little trick how to do it more than 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.860
 five fingers at once stores one 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.479
 at the moment it is actually on it 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.819
 Restricts the iphone to unlock and 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.960
 buy apps and music at the itunes store 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.090
 but you can imagine very well 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.930
 that apple in the future with touch the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.430
 maybe quite different things 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.990
 intended as for example one 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.220
 Pay for the supermarket cashier if you can 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.440
 account associated with what in the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.759
 direction is not completely unthinkable 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.470
 stay curious what with tata still 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.120
 happens moment it works like 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.979
 said pretty well the more you finger a 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.090
 not saved 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.039
 unreliable but that you more often 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.479
 minor errors occur if you only 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.210
 So two fingers has both thumbs 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.650
 I care then it works in 90 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.569
 percent of the cases as well as each 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.069
 once again the hint for security 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.380
 your fingerprints will not be here 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.940
 somewhere saved as jpeg or something 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.979
 So as a photo but the be 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.360
 encrypted and on the a7 so on 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.490
 the main processor in here in one 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.690
 high security tract filed there 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.080
 they can not be read by anyone 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.159
 become 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.110
 certainly not they will somehow 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.280
 via the cloud or otherwise to others 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.719
 people sent or to apple or 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.250
 any services stay here 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.210
 on the phone and here they come 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.039
 not so easy 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.620
 the camera is also new in the iphone 5 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.090
 s are still only eight megapixels 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.529
 but apple had breasts and 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.289
 sensor installed and that means that 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.800
 every single pixel is larger than 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.779
 before 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.029
 that means that it will absorb more light 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.900
 can and that it gives better pictures 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.650
 gives mainly in bad 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.779
 light conditions 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.639
 that's very nice, too 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.310
 burst mode or the serial picture function 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.900
 in the case of a pressure so to speak 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.219
 ten pictures per second takes so 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.090
 long you just kept pressed is the 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.740
 memory is full 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.740
 but what else has the video camera now 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.210
 a slow motion functions at the man 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.590
 Slow motion shots with 120 images per 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.599
 can also take a second 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.940
 cool what a pity it is 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.190
 when exporting and exporting the videos yourself 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.360
 then it's down to normal 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.370
 speed and you have to be so 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.409
 by hand, then count down on them 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.279
 to slow down 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.289
 maybe this will be redone 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.509
 that you actually in the 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.590
 slow motion can export to 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.840
 any case a pretty cool thing 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.539
 are recorded with 720p all others 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.800
 video recordings with 1080p the camera 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.440
 the front is also a bit better 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.580
 and can now synonymous 720p HD 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.840
 make recordings 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.610
 new is this too 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.310
 double LED flash you see behind 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.440
 there is a white led and a 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.760
 Colored LED will vary depending on the 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.139
 lighting conditions become the two 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.600
 coordinated and called that 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.550
 then Krutov called apple the order 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.020
 for example skin tones should be more natural 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.550
 you do not look and you do not see in the light 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.870
 more like a zombie but 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.919
 maybe like a normal person too 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.250
 if blood was used 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.169
 that was our test conclusion to the iphone 5 it 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.150
 Overall, a typical s class of 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.389
 apple that means as of iphone 4 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.310
 to iphone 4s few changes without 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.900
 There may be some in here 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.080
 a little bit more than the iphone 4s here 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.910
 we have touch id 9 64 bit a7 processor 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.860
 and the new camera are the three 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.210
 the main features are what we still have 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.190
 have to say and some 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.690
 sample pictures and benchmark results 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.760
 you can find them on giga de if you are here 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.979
 otherwise it was ours from 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.460
 test the iphone 5s and see you next 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.440
 not only the iphone 5 from apple is 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.610
 new but also the ipad r and therefore 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.650
 you should definitely ours 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.870
 test to albert he is not down here 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.550
 and how to set it up and seven 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.470
 installed and configured and what 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.020
 not as you see over here in 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.940
 our 17 hands 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.050
 I would tell you the video if 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.729
 you liked it you shared 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.960
 maybe even with your friends that 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.960
 It was from me until next time
