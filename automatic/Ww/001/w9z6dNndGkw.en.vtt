00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hello everyone today, I will tell about the drenched 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 keyboards and in general if its meaning 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 open repair on stream now 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.109
 I make out on the show ever since her husband 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 let's continue here I have already disassembled this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.529
 keyboard see this so-called file 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.099
 frame here is just molding the lame 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:32.030
 there will be such a crack there 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.050
 Here is the keyboard itself 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.450
 it's a mess 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 here respectively, the keys are gone but it 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.300
 quite a lot of time about 40 minutes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.719
 and so here we see it consists of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.800
 so to speak three layers of little Lena 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.800
 Now I will unpack I show it here 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750
 understanding 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:12.430
 here we also see a waterway got 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:16.960
 tear it over here and here it is 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.659
 confusing itself there is oxidation I tried 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 a little clean by the way here the same 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.610
 the very same spark 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.340
 got dark from this darkening with water was 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.100
 clean with the words of the client but still I 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.539
 I will say this from experience I will say that the chance of the area 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.340
 recovery almost zero 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:43.240
 let's look at the second part here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.390
 consists of two captivity chick and it turns out 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.610
 one plenochka that is contact ace 2 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.409
 the film on it is not the price there are such 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.569
 Here are the transitions and when this is 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.789
 specially dielectric is enclosed 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.909
 specially 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.130
 made a mask so -called if 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.899
 these transitions somewhere very often 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 the contact disappears and accordingly 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.009
 keyboard doesn't work 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.899
 I want to note that when you see something 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.269
 there is here let's say the plot 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.220
 completely but there is still a hole 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.989
 part of which water gets in if it is in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.140
 the loaf hit but in the middle I would say 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.070
 the water from there will dry I don't know but 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 according to my practice 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.010
 somewhere days 10 that is the principle turns out 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.739
 the next one just took the color 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.060
 bag principle that's what we drip 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.630
 drop there oh 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.630
 water is necessary 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.910
 and that is how the state is 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.950
 there is liquid there 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 how much do you think it will dry 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.700
 even if you put it in a warm place 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.940
 per month exactly it will dry 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.560
 the same thing here that is once here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.290
 water got and accordingly it will 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 dry do not try to extinguish the Finns 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 which brings a lot of fruit 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.470
 tried to dry the veins and turned over 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.160
 I will put the keyboard for 3 days 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.130
 warm place and everything is not here you see that 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.100
 there is something that will be well, how to know 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.790
 what if in such a position will dry 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.640
 water from there for weeks 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.250
 jellyfish baby me 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 that's there somewhere 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.090
 but drown 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.900
 molested the thinnest here between the films 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.310
 he got there where further comes here 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.200
 there is actually oxidation 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.570
 I do not recommend the principle to disassemble why 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.360
 because 2 more what you come across 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.110
 here is the transition here it is one time 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.760
 peeled off 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.940
 fingers for paw but not 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.540
 she will not work any dog 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.240
 should be ucla and now show on 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.060
 surface is some kind of metallized 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.640
 some layer yes and respectively y 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.640
 now somewhere we'll take her 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
 contact 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.520
 this see with renewal measured in 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.010
 ohm 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.340
 that is, the key somewhere there will be 203 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:43.360
 became so well what else to say if 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 flooded let's say taxi coke think that 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.280
 you have a keyboard even if you're there 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.870
 disassemble dry and the like 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.889
 think that she is a panorama right away 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:58.090
 why because pepsi-cola is acid 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.570
 beer, too, I myself. I was a young com 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.030
 Kapnula - moneyboxes in three minutes when 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.820
 I picked up the disassembled which I actually 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.800
 there wasnâ€™t becoming a track just 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.289
 was sitting 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.729
 Well, the same as another sweet drink 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:20.050
 Lakes on she does not go all have 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:23.110
 carbonic acid is therefore especially when 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.570
 the voltage occurs electrolysis liter 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.729
 chemical 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.970
 eroding contact well here's what 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.970
 have we said so for interesting 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.440
 tell show happening that is in 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.510
 reality if even distilled 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.849
 Here I had a case if exactly water 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.919
 took on put on the battery she 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.580
 saw off Sydney turned on anyway she 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.490
 not dried 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.240
 out a week later but the key or she 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.620
 earned 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.169
 but he may not be so lucky 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.060
 I had a lot of customers brought this 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:01.180
 mind is important to give me a cap 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:06.499
 or are already asking for a new keyboard that is 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:10.219
 The principle is clear and recovery 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:12.779
 chances i would say very very low 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:16.849
 of course you can try for interest 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:19.710
 but let's say this keyboard has already been raised 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.889
 half the keys do not work the abode itself 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.150
 yes here and unless corrosive yes no 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:31.219
 a little sourness on the back works 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.219
 be careful everyone bye
