more<00:01:05.400> severe<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:07.080> went<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.350> several

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
more severe and I went on several

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.610 
more severe and I went on several
different<00:01:07.800> topical<00:01:08.520> gels<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.270> I've<00:01:09.810> taken<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
different topical gels and I've taken a

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.950 
different topical gels and I've taken a
few<00:01:11.150> antibiotics<00:01:12.150> throughout<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.630> year<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
few antibiotics throughout the year and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
few antibiotics throughout the year and
throughout<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> time<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.240> never

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
throughout the time but I've never

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.050 
throughout the time but I've never
really<00:01:15.780> stuck<00:01:16.230> to<00:01:16.260> one<00:01:16.620> simply<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.190> my

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
really stuck to one simply because my

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
really stuck to one simply because my
parents<00:01:18.510> didn't<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.050> idea<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.440> an

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
parents didn't like the idea of an

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
parents didn't like the idea of an
antibiotic<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> most<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.440> was<00:01:22.530> topical

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
antibiotic and so most of it was topical

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.850 
antibiotic and so most of it was topical
treatments<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.730> those<00:01:24.230> kind<00:01:25.230> of<00:01:25.350> worked<00:01:25.560> off

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
treatments and those kind of worked off

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.510 
treatments and those kind of worked off
and<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> throughout<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.820> years<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.520> then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and on throughout the years and then

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.320 
and on throughout the years and then
when<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.150> turned<00:01:30.660> 16<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.980> doctor<00:01:32.970> my

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
when I turned 16 my doctor my

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.740 
when I turned 16 my doctor my
dermatologist<00:01:34.200> she<00:01:35.010> decided<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.630> would
