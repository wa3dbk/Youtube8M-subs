00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.060
[whistling wind]

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.380
Hey this is Brendan from KUIU.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.320
What we're trying to do is after every trip go through
exactly what we took and why we took it.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.960
So this trip I just got back on, 
we're at the lodge here,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.960
was a horseback backpack trip for Red Stag into The Andes

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.880
and I was packing for 5 to 7 days and the
temperature ranges were gonna be from about 25

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.000
to possibly as high as 70. Unfortunately, we didn't see any of that high end 70 stuff.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
So, I'm gonna go through clothing first. What I took and why I took it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.920
and optics and everything else.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.880
So as far as base layer top layer go, I brought

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.360
a Merino 125 T-Shirt, a Merino 210 T-Shirt...err a Zip-T, 
and the Tiburon Shirt.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.220
And I've been using this Tiburon Shirt a lot.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.339
It's great for, you know, windy days that are kinda warmer.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.340
It breathes really well, so I was
really happy with that system there.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.300
For pants, I brought Merino 145 zip long underwear
and the new Alpine Pant.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.040
Very happy with that pant, very durable, kneed pads work great. 
Everything was great with those so I was very happy with that.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.480
As far as outerwear went,
I only brought a Guide Vest and the new Kenai Jacket.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.920
I think I wore this 95% of the time.
We had some pretty cold weather with intermittent spitting rain.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.980
Very water resistant, very
warm. Riding a horse, it was phenomenal.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.800
Rain gear, which we used quite a bit, I brought
the Chugach system...Jacket and Pant.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.580
As far as gloves, I brought Guide Gloves,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.720
the new Northstar which I used a couple days 
when it was really cold.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.320
I brought a Merino Beanie,
Merino Neck Gaiter, a ball cap,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.300
our NuYarn Socks - two pairs.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.520
And that was literally everything I had in my pack,
in my pack or on me the whole time.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.740
That was it. I didn't take anything else.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.960
Very warm, dry, had no problems with anything.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.120
On the sleep system,
we were expecting a little bit of rain but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.819
not as much as we got and high winds, so what
I brought was a 15 degree bag which is on

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.779
kinda the lower end of the temperatures
we were gonna see.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.719
I brought a new prototype tent that we have
that's a 4-season tent.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.660
I was very happy I did. We got some 
monster wind and rain.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.620
The NeoAir Xlite blowup pad
which was great.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.560
In this bag here, I have Super Down Jacket and Pants. 
If it get really cold, that's what I sleep in or

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.540
glassing up high. I leave this in the bottom of my pack
every day no matter where I'm going so that was

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.660
one other piece of gear we had.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.860
As far as optics, I brought 10x40 Swarovski Rangefinding EL Binoculars

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.660
They were great. I brought 15's. 
Did not use them.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.460
Mostly because we only got above timber line to hunt
one afternoon because of the wind and rain.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.809
If I did this trip again, I would bring them again, 
but hopefully would get to use them more.

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:30.049
For a spotting scope, I brought a 65 Swarovski.
It was great. With my own tripod.

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.649
I always bring my own optics and I bring more glass
than I think I'll need.

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:39.300
Almost every trip I do, we end up brining my spotting scope versus the Guide's.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.700
So if you've got really good glass, 
I always suggest bringing it.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.760
Cup and spoon.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.220
As far as small stuff I brought, obviously had a cameraman along

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.720
so I brought a small camera, sunglasses which are important, especially riding horses,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:02.000
headlamp, backpack rain cover, satellite phone, 
havalon knife.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.590
This is basically it. The pack that I used
on this trip is the new ICON Pro 3200.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.400
For horseback, this bag is phenomenal. It carries
just enough to where you can basically get

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.130
everything you need into it. It's not too
big to wear on the horse. I put my Super Down

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.460
at the bottom of this every time inside the
pack so there was a little cushion between the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.880
back part of the saddle and the bag and I had no problems riding it. Never got sore. We did over 50 miles so

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.080
if you're doing a modified backpack horseback hunt, this is definitely the pack to have, so

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.940
Aside from that, this trip they brought the food
so we didn't have to worry about bringing out own food.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.520
I would suggest binging some candy bars 
and kind of stuff you like eating during the day.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.960
Obviously, all of ours are all gone but

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.920
other than that I was really happy with this 
system I used.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.520
Everything here I used and nothing I did not use.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.240
So if you get back from a trip and that's the case that you had just enough

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.420
and not too much, nothing went unused in your pack,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.640
you packed pretty right

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.220
and I was real happy with how this went.
