00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 colo colo returned to the triumph in the tournament 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.089
 national 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.009
 this Sunday with a solitary goal of 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.539
 Juan Carlos Dominguez the almost 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.849
 beat Santiago wanderers in the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.439
 monumental stadium after the game the 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.240
 protagonists of our infection on 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 the story of the caturros and the truth 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.939
 that we want to be a little more 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.070
 regular 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 let's hope they study when the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.449
 start of a regular phase that we want 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 we are aware that it can be a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 little bit more bulky the result is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 quite education we do not specify them 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.100
 but but very happy because it became 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.510
 to run as a tony person held like this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 that tranquility since the triumph and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.480
 from which he ran again as if 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 before is that when they are not satisfied 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 Sometimes the opponent also enlarges 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 that's why the first time I have enough 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 occasions thinking a while ago 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
 also or the complete one goes very high he 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 he realizes that he starts to have a little 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.980
 more but calm there is no need 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.199
 we are grabbing the rhythm is going to have 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 in to the goal and the weather 50 time well of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.790
 the best way I think 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 the week has been completed 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.050
 the matches that we have had visit 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
 contrary I say it I mean good 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.350
 now we have won here and we wanted to 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.370
 not breathe again important achievement the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.630
 wins the important the top 3 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.610
 now the week we will start with about 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 everything that we will talk about everything to see 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.060
 how he was in the desert he should 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 to do is from the outside we see the mistakes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.050
 that we committed followed like this until the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.190
 ignition corporal but positive and 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.080
 negative but that we will see the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760
 week the important thing at this moment the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.170
 week law the most skillful we are looking for 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.100
 By all means try to improve 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 unfortunately also 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 quite as fine at the time of defining 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 the parties and days not without big 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.659
 chances to have increased the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.149
 marker and 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.640
 missing that final stitch but in 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.979
 general lines the day to do as 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.509
 that said 60 parties for a long time 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.679
 with this scheme 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.929
 we went forward well a lot of 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.569
 party except the last 10 15 minute of 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.310
 world when he also tried to poke 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.969
 a lot more so offensive people 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.049
 same we get this task in front 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.709
 happy but knowing that you can 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.349
 Show a lot with caracas is common 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 seems to be better with iquique is a 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.799
 game also weird because I'm I'm 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 sometimes but they also had 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.310
 several and today I think the balance 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.379
 positive as I told you before I did not 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.150
 they scored goals and we won that won 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.040
 at home we were coming 42 games won 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.989
 but we are clear that if we want to be 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 champions we have for many end 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.430
 next week we improve a lot 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.530
 much more than we play in weeks 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 but here from smaller to bigger but what 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.340
 party match we know as I said before 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.470
 what a lot to improve but how do you 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.010
 I said, let's hope we win 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.820
 canada or Palestinian visitor to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.820
 obviously but as I say 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.080
 but you still have to have much more 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.700
 tranquility 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.090
 the goal of the protections millions the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.730
 drops to give you more security but so 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.500
 parties but that 's during the week it 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 go because it will stop me 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.680
 correct and I can not 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.570
 now happy with the three points and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 weights so that the things that are in 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.880
 happy heart because they are gave me the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.180
 possibility for colo colo 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.180
 grateful to God assuring 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.390
 they handled well when the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.060
 two forwards to a sector went well 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.880
 two and the other left over that I saw it quite 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.190
 well that is important because the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 iii background security and preserving 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.990
 is the zero that in other parties does not 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.430
 we could see we could not do that is 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.760
 very important for the team to go 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.710
 having the confidence of the solidity 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.080
 defensive the first time colo colo 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.960
 He made a good match if we did not arrive with two 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.770
 goals above would have been the fairest 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.280
 we arrived we handled the ball well 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.620
 we press well of course there are 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.030
 that have more regularity the long 90 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.640
 minutes a little after wander we were 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.940
 came without playing clear and we lost 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.530
 a little the handling of the ball we get tired 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.790
 some players that come 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.380
 replenishing some injuries like 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.450
 Dominguez like iron that later 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.670
 replace as the same sheet was in 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.350
 exit and that did not allow us to have the 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.370
 same play with the same intensity as 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.370
 we did in the first time
