00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.340
 how can the computer go so slowly 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.800
 such guys I'm looking at the comments 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.100
 of 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.010
 the video to answer and there's a one 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.520
 girl who is called gisela who says that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.140
 he passed the ball he missed where he was if 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.670
 do not tell me do not sleep tonight 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.670
 let's see look 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.560
 This is the place where I give you the ball and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 the ball chute in that direction makes 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.970
 a tad of wind I hope you do not hear 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.970
 if you hear it if you hear it I'm sorry 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 OK then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.240
 I'm going to look for it, and so the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.610
 we find together how beautiful everything now 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.630
 let's go for the jacket because it makes 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.989
 a chilly cold is worth everything and we apply 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.120
 here do not take the jacket that I do not 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.280
 put on the jacket because god is not 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's cold because I 'm not saying in 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 serious 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.450
 Well guys after 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.510
 / warm this hour 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.940
 it shows the wind 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.909
 yes my erroneous calculations 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.729
 and the ball should be around here 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.670
 should be around here in some area of 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.729
 these 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 if we find it, it can be a miracle 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.640
 but well let's go to find it with 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.640
 plant 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.310
 look 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.310
 you see this 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.070
 this I finish it young 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.960
 I just punctured me with a shit of 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.030
 plant the balls of those that have 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 spikes and it stays embedded in the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.490
 hand fuck me the fuck fuck like itchy 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.990
 the shit is in short let's go down with 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.330
 much care is worth it because this can be 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 dangerous it seems that no but this is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.740
 steep and you can stamp me carefully 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 let say 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.650
 it's true that if I record that if I record like this 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.049
 seems to be in to take for ass is 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.519
 what he said aldo that in my dances 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.120
 when I record in the forest it seems that I 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.430
 go to a site that is to be 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.170
 quite far but actually I'm in 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.170
 the same door of my house 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.850
 Well, to see the ball, it should be 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.040
 here unless you have eaten the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.720
 boars because of this forest and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 boars but do not worry because 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.440
 they only go out at night and so they do not 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.810
 one 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.260
 where's the ball dude where's the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.480
 little ball, guys, since I'm here, 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.290
 I would like to tell you about the topic of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.840
 stayed as I said in my video of 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.129
 main channel I said I was going to make a 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.170
 stayed and I do not know if I 'm 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.120
 focusing on me or good the case is that 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.220
 that I want to make a stay with 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.330
 you because many of you are 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.129
 saying and I would like the case is 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.930
 in which to see many I am receiving 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.290
 many comments that is in Madrid 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.110
 and in barcelona in valencia really 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.900
 like to be everywhere so that 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.549
 I can see you all, that is, but the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.150
 thing is difficult then I am from 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.460
 barcelona is worth then I think that the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.020
 first stay 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.820
 being just not just but that since 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.580
 I am from here I would like the first 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.580
 was left in Barcelona 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.600
 and then as I usually go to Madrid a lot 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.120
 the next one would be in Madrid 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.920
 so what do you think guys the first 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.430
 Barcelona 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.320
