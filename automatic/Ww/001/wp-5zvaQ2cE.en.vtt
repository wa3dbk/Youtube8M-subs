00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 that opel is not feeling well is not 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 secret that they are cars again 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.649
 Building the go really well is many 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 not so clear 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 the new astra opc is an example 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 for that one in rüsselsheim not yet 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 has forgotten how to really good 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.720
 engines builds 280 hp, the youngest 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.660
 lightning from a two-liter turbocharged engine 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 this is the car test in 6 3 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.400
 seconds from zero to 100 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.559
 at 250 the limiter waits loud speedometer 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 But then I'm already at 270 in the whole 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.030
 normal driving is the astra opc 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.590
 but quite humane to the environment 9 liters 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.830
 at our test round are at so much 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.839
 force respectable when racing is 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.339
 the natural waste was working 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.449
 include though not necessarily one 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.670
 be pure racer 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.660
 the opc is first time a coupe that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.550
 is already called home 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.769
 sporty with only three goals then has 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.659
 280 ps left everything on the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.610
 vorderachse 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.860
 that is sporty, but I have to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.839
 say on the track was me 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.089
 personally then a tick too soft 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.090
 that is uncompromising that still works 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.130
 sharper who drives only on the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.850
 race track that's why it's natural 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.159
 the everyday compromise athletes as well 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.009
 you used to look sporty 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.830
 and also goes sporty but not 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.600
 too hard and not too extreme 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.880
 not to him for the holiday trip 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.369
 or for the drive to kindergarten or 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.759
 where else to use so seen 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.170
 Opel already has the right job in 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.350
 the right job can be done 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.149
 rüsselsheimer but also pay well 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.289
 35,000 100 euros you have to preserve 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.939
 donate from opel 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.380
 that is in comparison to one 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.450
 slightly weaker for that though 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.579
 two and a half thousand euros more expensive vw 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 Golf r still cheap but in 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.810
 our test is a renault mégane 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.479
 coupé rs on the other side and the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.700
 is the league for that you get at opel 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.639
 but also that more versatile car of the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.219
 astra opc loses the sport bet but 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.380
 If you refer to the everyday life with 1 , he is ahead 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.119
 his chassis can namely electronically 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 between the racecourse and the travel route 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.500
 distinguish if a car test the the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.300
 renault megane hears he beckons 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.830
 mostly from the past years 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.080
 the french have their compact 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.870
 not very lovingly tuned that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.060
 should now be different in the year 2012 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.410
 the mégane rs leaves the athlete 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 hang out and you notice that already at 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.970
 first bump the suspension is hard and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.290
 merciless but with the crisp 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 circuit and direct steering 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.640
 feels the french really well 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 rs stands at this mega apparently for 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.730
 race tracks and sports has a big one 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.989
 History there was coordinated 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.519
 They are now forming formula 1 teams 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.530
 actually bring it to the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.250
 vegan right bang i was totally 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 surprised 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 round three I've also there 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.010
 we've gained the thing drives 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.470
 really good on the race track direct 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.939
 steering crisp circuit drehfreudiger 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.560
 turbo engine actually me too 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.060
 a sucker reminds it must for the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.250
 to be right sport faster 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.840
 well done with darten plates had to 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.760
 Renault, however, a few springs 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280
 leave at Stammtisch quartet is there 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.799
 Rear recovers 510 hp less from his 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.569
 second turbo engine as the astra opc and 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.659
 also does not accelerate quite so fast 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.659
 that's what the mafia feels like 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.790
 at the top speed is the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.520
 franzose not sealed off but for the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.470
 254 km / h you need a lot of exercise 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.630
 or best backwind of consumption 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450
 lies with 8 9 liters on 100 kilometers 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.130
 slightly better than the astra opc and the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.650
 although the mégane clearly greedy on 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.590
 gas hangs as the rüsselsheimer only 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.620
 comfort everyday, all that is not 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.370
 necessarily on the side of peres us 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.110
 talk about right sports coupes for a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.640
 young audience and there is yes 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.490
 Of course, from the color scheme 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.500
 better done than sarah that renault 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.510
 Sports money is a formally 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.130
 that is so striking I think that's good 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.350
 for such a car it must be the same 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.270
 Rims red brake brakes 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.180
 So that is well composed and 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.770
 I believe the clientele in the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 In the end, it does not matter if it's the big one 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.070
 have a trunk or on one 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.870
 bad road bad springs for 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.960
 the really interested sport freak 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.670
 is that taken because of that wins 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.920
 renault mégane rs also in this 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.210
 Comparison of sport evaluation in everyday life 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.430
 he certainly has his weaknesses 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.900
 but then ask for a rs model 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.900
 but not really anyone or
