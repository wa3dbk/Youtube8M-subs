00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.519
 hello speaks to you isaac of the angel of 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.289
 mechanical book dotcom on this occasion 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.900
 let's see how to do a test 

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.430
 diagnosis to a horn bug if 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.830
 you have electrical problems with your 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.930
 horn whether function does not work 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.179
 once in a while it is diagnostic test 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.490
 will help you rule out if the 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.349
 own cornet if you've seen evidence in 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.050
 another part of the horn system like 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.449
 can be wiring relays fuses 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.699
 or terminals and you do not find the problem 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.399
 in that part of the system it can be 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.070
 that the problem is in the horn itself 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.500
 with this test we are going to rule out if 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.030
 really the cornet still works 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.030
 let's see how to do it 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.020
 Well, let's try our kitchen 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.960
 of clarkson for it we are going to use 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.840
 a test lamp 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.059
 and the battery of our car to be able 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.309
 well to prove it what we have to do is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.380
 connect our alligator to the pole 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.630
 positive battery 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.140
 here we connect it to be able to do the 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.480
 test before trying the cornets there 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.550
 to check first that it really is 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.030
 well connected the only thing that we have to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.460
 to do is touch the negative post 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 there is lighting our lamp 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.680
 try it, it is more us 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.660
 we make sure we really connect it 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 well now we already proceed to check 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.610
 our horn kitchen 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.450
 good as we can see here we have 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.729
 our horn bugler is a bit 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.010
 hidden we have it below the car 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.320
 and here we can see the cable that arrives 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.080
 towards the cornet that is the cable 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.360
 positive signal what we are going to do is 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.370
 First it is to check with our lamp 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.460
 test if it really is landed this 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.950
 the bugle remember that the same 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.010
 are connected to the chassis by this 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.660
 part because girls from here with the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.930
 pro lamp you have to try the terminal 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.170
 it's going on here we see that it's 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.760
 igniting which means that our 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.250
 current is connected to ground 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.770
 remember that our to prove the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 we connect to current and when hitting the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.300
 tip of the board when you finish playing 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.520
 when touching the terminal is receiving 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.130
 ground of the same chassis that happens to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.620
 through the cornet we can check 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.190
 what really if connected to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.520
 old earth more you have to check with 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.830
 another cable 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.930
 you have to apply voltage here does not sound the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.670
 bugle although this one served because 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.240
 because there is a voltage drop then 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.900
 for that reason it does not make the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.480
 bugle only allows us to check if 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.160
 there's a nap landed the cornet right now 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.210
 we will check it with a cable to see 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.210
 if it really works 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 Well now we are going to apply what 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.930
 which is our correct horn 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 applying voltage here I'm going to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.550
 use what is the same cable that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.110
 I have in the test lamp you 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.030
 can use the same can use 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.250
 other than how you make them more 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.860
 easy I'm going to use this because to 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.540
 it's easier for me to do it from this 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.220
 way I just connect what is my 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.220
 alligator to the party 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.920
 of positive battery and here already 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.320
 I have my cable that is the same lamp 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.470
 test I'm going to take with the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.690
 that I'm going to tempt what is the side of 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.400
 positive input for the horn not 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.980
 I'll connect it to you and with this same 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.070
 and do the test here but the only thing 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.440
 remove was the tip of the pencil that no no 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.780
 It does not work for me and the borough also 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.060
 nothing else occupied this part what is the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.360
 cable which is what it will have to contain 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.180
 the voltage remember that this with the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.120
 same test lamp this we have 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.100
 voltage but not enough to be 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680
 to be able to make it work as there 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.890
 voltage drop with what is this 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 bulb then that's why it does not serve us very 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.670
 well then for that to take it off and 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.590
 let's use the pure cable if we go 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.590
 to crash we will do this test 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.950
 well here we are again from the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.670
 cornet 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.920
 this is the terminal which we are going to 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.060
 shrink the one we're going to try with the 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.180
 voltage 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.490
 here comes the remarkable cable in the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.740
 horn circuit here comes the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.600
 current and we are going to apply 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.330
 the direct voltage to see if it really 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.160
 it works here with our cable in 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.750
 practice it let's see 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.750
 let's play this cable 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.279
 we see that the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.740
 this bugle does not sound quite right 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.740
 a little hoarse but still works 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.090
 do not
