00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
where this one lives again from whistles

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.910 
where this one lives again from whistles

and this is just a blue suede but I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.020 
and this is just a blue suede but I
really<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.579> like<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.849> kind<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
really like this like it's kind of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.190 
really like this like it's kind of
different<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:09.540> my<00:03:09.629> other<00:03:09.690> ones<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.079> got

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
different to all my other ones it's got

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.740 
different to all my other ones it's got
a<00:03:10.230> long<00:03:10.500> gold<00:03:11.220> strap<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.629> with

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
a long gold strap and I like that with

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.660 
a long gold strap and I like that with
this<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.079> because<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.440> makes<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:14.099> bag<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.609> a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
this one because it makes the bag like a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.670 
this one because it makes the bag like a
little<00:03:14.970> bit<00:03:15.150> classy<00:03:16.079> it's<00:03:16.260> probably<00:03:16.530> not<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
little bit classy it's probably not the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.170 
little bit classy it's probably not the
safest<00:03:17.160> one<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:17.639> it's<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.819> got<00:03:18.060> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
safest one because it's just got a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.720 
safest one because it's just got a
little<00:03:18.359> magnetic<00:03:19.169> kind<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.530> flip<00:03:19.919> top<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
inside there's no zip which makes me a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.339 
inside there's no zip which makes me a
bit<00:03:23.400> sad<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:23.910> just<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.329> hold<00:03:24.780> onto<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.139> top
