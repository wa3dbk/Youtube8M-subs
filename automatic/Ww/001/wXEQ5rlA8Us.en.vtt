 PREPARATION OF SODIUM CHLORIDE 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 Hello! In this video I will show two ways of preparing sodium chlorate. 

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:34.400
 For the first method, we will need 100 mL of common chlorine (5%), without additives and dyes. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.700
 Place it in a hearth and heat it to boiling for several minutes. 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 This part of the process is proposed to be done outdoors, since the solution vapors are unhealthy. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.700
 Gradually you may notice the formation of crystals. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.500
 Bleach is a sodium hypochlorite solution. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.400
 When boiled, sodium hypochlorite undergoes autoreduction 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 to sodium chlorite and sodium chloride. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.700
 To separate the two products, we take advantage of the difference in their solubility. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 When a large amount of crystals of sodium chloride settle down 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.000
 drain the liquid without dropping the crystals and heat again to remove all water. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.000
 Now you can collect the product. You can do a recrystallization 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.001
 for extra cleaning if you want. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 This is the final sodium chlorate product made by this method. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 The other method we will study is through electrolysis. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 Instead of bleach, we will need 50 grams of sodium chloride. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 Add 200 mL of water and stir until completely dissolved. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.600
 Heat at a temperature close to the boiling point of the solution and close the circuit. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 I use two copper electrodes and, apparently, are strongly corroded. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.400
 Filter the solution periodically to get rid of the suspended particles of copper 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.800
 and continue electrolysis. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 This is the final solution of sodium chlorate. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.600
 I prefer the first method because it is faster 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.000
 and yields a product of better quality. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 I will use sodium chlorate in a future video for the preparation of sodium permanganate. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 Stay tuned. Thanks for watching.
