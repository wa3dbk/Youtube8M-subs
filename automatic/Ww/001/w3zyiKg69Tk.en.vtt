 feature is that our that 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.400
 dust to a tiltable container in 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.200
 plastic that allows us to go to 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.590
 store carbon so it didn't have 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.920
 never messed up but we can 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.050
 also be of cadore sacs 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.730
 I don't go anymore 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.630
 within this being able to because there 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.290
 I show how it works so for 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.010
 detail 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.630
 we note we see that we have the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.320
 thermometer on the thermometer cover 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.540
 the difference of the models in the past from 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.640
 this year the web was ground in 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.920
 European parcels will look for products 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.420
 on the European market places the temperature 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.360
 in degrees centigrade of the outside of 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.640
 that makes it less inside 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.560
 relevant while at the madness of the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.880
 contrary 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.920
 for him even easier to read 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.690
 we have our handle with one 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.520
 heat shield to avoid going there 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.210
 burn we take it to grab it with 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.190
 the control of the ventilation system 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.660
 place this here on the lid 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.460
 version of the reaction however the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.680
 placed below the barbie that there 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.410
 lets you go and check the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.050
 combustion of the termolese manage the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:53.600
 temperature has taken we notice the grid 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.600
 performers press deluxe arrival Japan 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.430

 growth recharge in the field nor in 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.410
 cooking was in fact the central ring 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.240
 which can be removed to go to 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.640
 integrate what are the accessories 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.470
 by bus below we have the 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.530
 system how much it allows us both to 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.910
 adjust the combustion air that of 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:28.210
 go and download our ashes 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:34.870

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:40.320
 I'm going to show the toilet containment 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.730

 that the timers can be removed for which one 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.150
 once our culture is over 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.920
