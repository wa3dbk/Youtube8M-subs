00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.740 
thought one simple easy gift for all of
the<00:03:22.400> kids<00:03:22.610> instead<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.239> putting

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the kids instead of like putting

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.850 
the kids instead of like putting
together<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:24.050> little<00:03:24.170> Treat<00:03:24.410> Bags<00:03:24.560> would<00:03:24.770> be

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
together a little Treat Bags would be

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.760 
together a little Treat Bags would be
easy<00:03:25.040> plus<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.030> kids<00:03:26.209> will<00:03:26.420> get<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.780> use<00:03:27.440> their

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
easy plus the kids will get to use their

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.680 
easy plus the kids will get to use their
tickets<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.700> they<00:03:28.730> get<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> Chucky<00:03:29.270> Cheese<00:03:29.420> to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
tickets that they get a Chucky Cheese to

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.350 
tickets that they get a Chucky Cheese to
get<00:03:29.810> all<00:03:29.959> those<00:03:30.200> tiny<00:03:30.470> little<00:03:31.150> trinkets<00:03:32.150> I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
get all those tiny little trinkets I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.300 
get all those tiny little trinkets I
guess<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.690> could<00:03:32.870> say<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:33.890> thought<00:03:34.070> this

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
guess you could say but I thought this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.400 
guess you could say but I thought this
would<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.760> fun<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.300> was<00:03:35.480> practical<00:03:36.020> I<00:03:36.200> think

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
would be fun and was practical I think

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.530 
would be fun and was practical I think
these<00:03:36.530> were<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> dollar<00:03:37.160> fifty<00:03:37.610> each<00:03:37.790> at

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
these were like a dollar fifty each at

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.320 
these were like a dollar fifty each at
Party<00:03:39.440> City<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:39.920> picked<00:03:40.160> up<00:03:40.370> all<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.209> these

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
Party City so I picked up all of these

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.910 
Party City so I picked up all of these
for<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> kids<00:03:41.840> different<00:03:42.230> colors<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.620> got<00:03:42.769> all

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
for the kids different colors I got all

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.220 
for the kids different colors I got all
boy<00:03:43.070> colors<00:03:43.489> obviously<00:03:44.060> because<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.510> didn't

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
boy colors obviously because I didn't

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.170 
boy colors obviously because I didn't
want<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.440> boys<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.620> fight<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.610> got<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.970> pink

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180

want the boys to fight and I got a pink
one<00:03:47.330> for<00:03:47.360> Emma<00:03:47.709> but<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.739> just<00:03:48.950> thought<00:03:49.040> that

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
one for Emma but I just thought that

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.690 
one for Emma but I just thought that
would<00:03:49.340> kind<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.580> be<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> fun<00:03:50.060> little<00:03:50.410> add-on<00:03:51.410> to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
would kind of be a fun little add-on to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.479 
would kind of be a fun little add-on to
their<00:03:52.700> birthday<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.650> that's<00:03:54.830> pretty<00:03:55.070> much<00:03:55.250> it

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
their birthday so that's pretty much it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.640 
their birthday so that's pretty much it
we're<00:03:55.700> keeping<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.150> easy<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.600> year<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.080> feel
