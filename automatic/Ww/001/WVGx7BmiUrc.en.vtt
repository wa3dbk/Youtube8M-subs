00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello again and snapped up 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.470
 rod Spartak comp silence cards 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.510
 rods workers 13 feet three and a half 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.369
 b 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.619
 well, not even semi-parabolic 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.400
 about parabolic said look like 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.110
 she bends what's called sticky me 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.939
 I think this rod is undervalued and therefore 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 that everyone is used to catapult rods 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.739
 new series they have if markers 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.230
 Cat's rod way from very popular 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.460
 among karpyatnikov and working catapults 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.850
 which we will show you later but 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 this rod is very interesting to me 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 like it now we will see 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 as far as long-range well 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.019
 certainly have high hopes for that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 long-range because he has 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.699
 shortened grip compared to other 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.469
 models 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.899
 but very interesting build i think that 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.010
 on vyvazhivanii this rods will lead 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.010
 yourself just gorgeous 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.570
 true connoisseurs will get a lot 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.189
 pleasures from this will be me night well 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.119
 let's try to throw osnaz 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:25.009
 put well let's look at 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.540
 how much can you calculate the approximate what 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:34.610
 the distance of this rod is quite soft 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.969
 sad light on 1213 count hung my 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.969
 leash a little pain 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 and without fanaticism just see 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:51.219
 how much will these things allow us 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.219
 throw 10 so 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.950
 only allow throw fishing lines move away 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.440
 when the sinker sinks 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.170
 choose slack you look from mega that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.530
 sad day 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.530
 allow me please 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:55.750
 reset and went already interesting 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:03:10.850
 rods work you can say the image itself 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:17.780
 skills 150 grams load does not help it 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:49.790
 plan dark black almost here this series 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:55.550
 under Karpishin zoom we will increase to 41 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:59.320
 meter principle rods i'm pretty i 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.850
 soft bed and a flock allows you to do 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.580
 relatively long casts to catch 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.680
 possible 140 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.670
 if someone on will of course have to 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.670
 to put 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 throw technique in honor of 1
