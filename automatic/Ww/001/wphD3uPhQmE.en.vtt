any differences between the three DS and
the<00:02:48.650> Wii<00:02:48.830> U<00:02:48.950> versions<00:02:49.459> when<00:02:49.640> all<00:02:49.760> said<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the Wii U versions when all said and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.479 
the Wii U versions when all said and
done<00:02:50.209> most<00:02:50.780> likely<00:02:51.019> not<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:52.190> I'm<00:02:52.310> probably

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
done most likely not but I'm probably

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.990 
done most likely not but I'm probably
going<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.850> have<00:02:53.060> some<00:02:53.810> content<00:02:54.380> from<00:02:54.560> both<00:02:55.000> so

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
going to have some content from both so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.759 
going to have some content from both so
definitely<00:02:56.450> look<00:02:56.810> forward<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> lot<00:02:57.680> of

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
definitely look forward to that a lot of

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.850 
definitely look forward to that a lot of
gaming<00:02:58.069> content<00:02:58.310> coming<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.030> channel

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
gaming content coming to this channel

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.229 
gaming content coming to this channel
another<00:03:00.860> reason<00:03:01.040> why<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.910> as<00:03:02.090> much

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
another reason why I don't have as much

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.680 
another reason why I don't have as much
gaming<00:03:02.540> content<00:03:02.870> now<00:03:03.319> once<00:03:03.860> again<00:03:04.390> time<00:03:05.390> being

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
gaming content now once again time being

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.330 
gaming content now once again time being
a<00:03:05.780> factor<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.380> two<00:03:06.680> there's<00:03:06.860> just<00:03:07.010> really<00:03:07.130> not

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
a factor and two there's just really not

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.860 
a factor and two there's just really not
that<00:03:07.489> much<00:03:07.610> out<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.209> don't<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.540> if<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.690> guys

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.660 
that much out I don't know if you guys
know<00:03:09.049> guys<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.680> noticed<00:03:09.890> there's<00:03:10.250> not<00:03:10.400> too

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
know guys have noticed there's not too

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.479

been<00:03:13.970> another<00:03:14.239> big<00:03:14.480> reason<00:03:14.720> why<00:03:15.049> there<00:03:15.739> has

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
been another big reason why there has

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.800 
been another big reason why there has
not<00:03:16.160> been<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.610> much<00:03:16.700> gameplay<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.540> this
