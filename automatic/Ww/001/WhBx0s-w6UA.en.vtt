in a bpa-free can the only reason I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
in a bpa-free can the only reason I
recommend<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:35.970> those

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
recommend that is because I use those

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.560 
recommend that is because I use those
because<00:01:37.790> preparing<00:01:38.790> beans<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.210> scratch

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
because preparing beans from scratch

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140
