00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.260
 welcome to the metabolism tb your source 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.310
 of correct information about 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.330
 metabolism and health brown sugar 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.430
 sugar white sugar natural sugar 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
 cane sugar sugar 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.700
 I am fran Suarez specialist in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 obesity and metabolism 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 One of the people who visits us 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 metabolism tv asks us a question 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 and he asks us in the episode of the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 artificial industry that is the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 episode number 29 that says hello frank 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.910
 My name is JosÃ© Torres, I would like to know 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 What is your opinion about the sugar 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.680
 brunette since it is supposedly natural and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.630
 unrefined thank you in advance good ok 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.470
 let's talk about this think 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:09.340
 sugar I want to tell you that sugar 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 it's sugar then one of the problems 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 main ones that we have in the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.440
 society in our modern society 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.260
 the excessive consumption of sugar that has 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.540
 different forms the brown sugar as 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.540
 such is nothing other than a sugar 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.940
 refined less 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 naturally you think of being refined 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.070
 less and think good because it is less 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.230
 refined because reality must be better 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.040
 is that the difference between sugar 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.880
 brunette and white sugar 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.170
 is not significant in many cases because 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.510
 example the American industry the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.740
 industry the gringos do not have the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.220
 custom and this I was investigating 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.050
 what do they make white sugar 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.120
 and then they throw him like 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.220
 like an ice cream on top that gives it a color 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.010
 and it is not a sugar that is less refined 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.200
 then sugar is sugar the problem 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.570
 of sugar and this was already discovered and I 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.770
 I will be talking to you 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.290
 coming soon in a series that we're going to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.110
 do in metabolism do you know 3tb about 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.440
 this the sugar problem the sugar is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.260
 make up of two of two substances the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.260
 sugar is composed of fructose 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.890
 added to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.890
 glucose 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.370
 it's sugar 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.799
 that is, it has half fructose half glucose 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.810
 that's what sugar is now a 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.640
 discovery that has been made true is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.890
 what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.370
 have been tested to take a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.319
 person and give high doses of glucose 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.090
 glucose in the blood sugar just like 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.440
 the one that runs in our blood what 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540
 that the diabetic goes up in glucose 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.910
 because the body the main sugar that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.580
 they use the cell in glucose is this 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.250
 fructose the sugar that as it says 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.750
 name comes from fruits 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 comes for example he 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.560
 honey honey has a lot of fructose and 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.290
 less glucose higher in fructose the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.780
 fruit but you are Fructose 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.240
 vegetable that has little fructose 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.970
 They are obviously sweeter the 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.550
 the fruits that the vegetables because in 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.500
 true the fructose is quite sweeter 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.690
 that glucose so what does the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.960
 sweet sweet today for example the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.290
 cocacola you see not all that refreshment with 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.180
 what sweeten it is with fructose with 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.860
 glucose is with fructose that leaves a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 fructose that they take to the oil of 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.450
 corn and it's called in English it's called high 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.420
 fruits with ciro or high corn silos 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.160
 fructose which is what sweetens them 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.600
 nowadays all the refreshments 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 basically the discoveries that you 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.250
 have made 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 and if you take these are tests that have been 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.849
 clinical fact clinical programs are 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.590
 tests that are done in a group where 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.250
 they are giving to a group they are giving 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.470
 fructose the other is giving glucose 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.530
 this and neither of the two groups knows 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.840
 who is receiving this zeal is done 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.459
 they make it masked so that the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.960
 person does not know to be what 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.380
 they call a double blaine it's all a 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.330
 study 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.300
 blind where the person who is 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.020
 receiving can not influence it 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.570
 mentally with what you are receiving 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.860
 does not have a placebo effect and 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.330
 basically what has been discovered is 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.070
 fascinating what has been discovered is 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.530
 that if you give a person a 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.320
 overdose of glucose an excess of 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.040
 glucose then the person 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.900
 is going to be able to put on a little bit 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.220
 get fat because he has excess glucose 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.610
 like what we talked about in the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.669
 metabolism power book 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.520
 but nevertheless has no inflammation not 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.050
 it affects your blood pressure to have 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.750
 excess glucose only fattens it 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.099
 now they did the test and instead of 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.800
 give glucose they give to another group 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.750
 fructose and here the story changes 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.250
 because fructose does not rise so much 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.780
 glucose in the blood because it is handled 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.760
 different in the liver 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.100
 it is not handled like glucose in the 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.800
 body why many diabetics will 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.900
 are recommending that they use fructose what 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.460
 which is a serious error because when the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.560
 person in the group that you started 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.330
 give fructose what comes out of here is 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.680
 much inflammation 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:36.250
 inflammation much uric acid causing 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.460
 the drop and many high problems 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.410
 Pressure 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.030
 but mainly what causes the most 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.030
 fructose is excess triglycerides 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.270
 which are fats in the blood so 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.610
 all these people that so much the day 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.560
 taking this his fruit juices because 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.420
 think it 's natural eating a lot 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.800
 and other sweet fruit as you know it 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.230
 is the cause of your high triglycerides 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.020
 of your uric acid inflammation if 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.450
 has drop and high pressure now the 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.030
 brown sugar as such is for me in my 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.100
 opinion is that it is like a deception 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.920
 the key is that you use the least 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.320
 sugar is possible so for me 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.450
 sugar is sugar I do not know if it's brown or 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.640
 if it's white for me it's like a hoax 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.040
 because basically it 's just a color 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.320
 or something that they are leaving there can not 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.390
 you claim that you really have a 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.990
 difference in terms of content of 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.720
 minerals of many more vitamins in that 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.520
 because it does not provide us with any vitamin or 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.990
 nothing essential to the body that's a 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.230
 as they called empty calorie 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.330
 nutritionists so at the time of 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.830
 look for health you have to reduce the 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.230
 sugar because one of the problems that 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.690
 we have and if you thought you could go to 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.580
 using fructose was wrong because the 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.520
 Studies show that it's been a long time 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.129
 plus 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.330
 So these are the share because 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.330
 truth always triumphs
