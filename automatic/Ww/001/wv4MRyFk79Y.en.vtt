like this six months a half a year
before<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:25.140> Japan<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> early<00:00:26.220> countries

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
before in like Japan and early countries

before in like Japan and early countries
like<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.029> seriously<00:00:27.420> six<00:00:28.230> months<00:00:28.619> I'm

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
like that but seriously six months I'm

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.580 
like that but seriously six months I'm
sure<00:00:29.340> why<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.609> did<00:00:29.970> take<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.510> long<00:00:30.960> time<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
when nothing here is going to be

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
when nothing here is going to be
launched<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> very<00:00:41.190> interesting<00:00:41.610> specs

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
launched but the very interesting specs

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
launched but the very interesting specs
here<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.050> device<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
here that we can see on this device so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
here that we can see on this device so
they're<00:00:44.520> saying<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> obviously<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> galaxy

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
they're saying that obviously the galaxy

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.400 
they're saying that obviously the galaxy
s3<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> come<00:00:47.789> before<00:00:48.629> next<00:00:49.170> year

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
s3 is not going to come before next year

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
s3 is not going to come before next year
I<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.680> almost<00:00:49.800> guarantee<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
I can almost guarantee that and the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
I can almost guarantee that and the
thing<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.260> we're<00:00:52.890> gonna<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.550> the

thing is that we're gonna have like the
Samsung<00:00:54.090> Galaxy<00:00:54.120> Note<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.989> early<00:00:55.890> January<00:00:56.430> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Samsung Galaxy Note in early January so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
Samsung Galaxy Note in early January so
we're<00:00:57.390> problems<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.440> galaxy's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
we're problems can see this galaxy's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.840 
we're problems can see this galaxy's
three<00:00:59.520> before<00:01:00.140> like<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> middle<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.949> 2012<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
three before like the middle or 2012 and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
three before like the middle or 2012 and
the<00:01:03.539> room<00:01:03.690> respects<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the room respects right now is kind of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
the room respects right now is kind of
insane<00:01:04.949> since<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.580> first<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
insane since like first you're going to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.510 
insane since like first you're going to
have<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:06.810> bigger<00:01:07.049> screen<00:01:07.439> instead<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> 4.3

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
have much bigger screen instead of a 4.3

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.870 
have much bigger screen instead of a 4.3
I'm<00:01:08.850> gonna<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> four<00:01:09.390> point<00:01:09.570> 65<00:01:10.020> inch

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
I'm gonna have a four point 65 inch

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
I'm gonna have a four point 65 inch
super<00:01:11.880> amoled<00:01:11.909> plus<00:01:12.380> display<00:01:13.520> with<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
super amoled plus display with the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
super amoled plus display with the
extremely<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.840> resolution<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:16.920> at

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
extremely good resolution if you look at

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
extremely good resolution if you look at
the<00:01:17.460> resolution<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the resolution we have right now on the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.300 
the resolution we have right now on the
galaxy<00:01:19.530> s2<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.700> 480<00:01:21.150> x<00:01:21.330> 800<00:01:21.960> pixels<00:01:22.310> but

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
galaxy s2 we have 480 x 800 pixels but

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090 
galaxy s2 we have 480 x 800 pixels but
on<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> new<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.600> could<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> 1280<00:01:25.619> x

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
on this new one we could have 1280 x

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.690 
on this new one we could have 1280 x
1024<00:01:28.189> resolution<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> ppi<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.439> 352

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
1024 resolution with the ppi with 352

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
1024 resolution with the ppi with 352
ppi<00:01:32.700> pixels<00:01:33.090> per<00:01:33.240> inch<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:34.200> better

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
ppi pixels per inch and that's better

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
ppi pixels per inch and that's better
than<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.650> iphone<00:01:34.740> 4<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.970> obviously

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
than the iphone 4 and they obviously

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
than the iphone 4 and they obviously
should<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.630> better<00:01:36.930> than<00:01:37.049> life<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.650> used

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
should be better than life and for used

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.160 
should be better than life and for used
because<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.270> new<00:01:42.420> advice<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.020> know

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
because it is it's a new advice you know

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.370 
because it is it's a new advice you know
it's<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.890> new<00:01:44.040> device<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.840> if<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it's a new device and if we look at the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.609 
it's a new device and if we look at the
resolution<00:01:47.369> 1280<00:01:48.000> x<00:01:48.210> 20<00:01:48.600> 1024<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.470> going

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
resolution 1280 x 20 1024 that's going

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
resolution 1280 x 20 1024 that's going
to<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:50.009> better<00:01:50.220> than<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.270> going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to be much better than the or it's going

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
to be much better than the or it's going
to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> ugliest<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.049> better<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.590> dances

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to be a ugliest little better or dances

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
to be a ugliest little better or dances
yeah<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> note<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.740 
yeah like a note that like the
resolution<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.470> 1280<00:01:56.310> x<00:01:56.490> 800<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.630> should

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
resolution of 1280 x 800 and we should

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
resolution of 1280 x 800 and we should
also<00:01:57.840> remember<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> Galaxy<00:01:58.710> Note<00:01:58.740> have

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
also remember that the Galaxy Note have

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.870 
also remember that the Galaxy Note have
bigger<00:01:59.460> screen<00:01:59.990> 4.3<00:02:00.990> inch<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.790> have

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
bigger screen 4.3 inch I think you have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.770 
bigger screen 4.3 inch I think you have
went<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> 4.5<00:02:03.990> point<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.790> 5.3<00:02:05.790> inch<00:02:05.820> display

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
went to 4.5 point or 5.3 inch display

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.270 
went to 4.5 point or 5.3 inch display
with<00:02:06.810> 1280<00:02:07.350> x<00:02:07.530> 800<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.030> only<00:02:09.149> 4.6

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
with 1280 x 800 and this one is only 4.6

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.860 
with 1280 x 800 and this one is only 4.6
65<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.209> we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
we're going to have a little more RAM

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.979 
we're going to have a little more RAM
I'm<00:02:46.709> sure<00:02:47.010> how<00:02:47.609> much<00:02:47.760> run<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:48.329> have<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
I'm sure how much run do we have right

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.920 
I'm sure how much run do we have right
now<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.200> won<00:02:52.200> gigabytes<00:02:52.650> or<00:02:52.890> 800<00:02:53.930> 1

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
now I think you won gigabytes or 800 1

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.839 
now I think you won gigabytes or 800 1
gigabyte<00:02:55.260> oh<00:02:55.440> yeah<00:02:55.650> well<00:02:56.129> one<00:02:56.310> gigabyte<00:02:56.640> of
