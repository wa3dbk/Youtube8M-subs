we're here today at folded cover in our
research<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.240> development<00:00:03.689> lab<00:00:03.720> today<00:00:04.620> we're

research and development lab today we're

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.170 
research and development lab today we're
going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.950> take<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> look<00:00:05.520> at<00:00:05.609> some<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.000> key

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
going to take a look at some of the key

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.330 
going to take a look at some of the key
functionality<00:00:06.779> differences<00:00:07.170> between<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
functionality differences between the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.600 
functionality differences between the
folded<00:00:08.670> cover<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.330> extang<00:00:09.750> solid<00:00:10.080> fold

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
folded cover and the extang solid fold

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.410 
folded cover and the extang solid fold
immediately<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.910> first<00:00:12.059> thing<00:00:12.300> you'll

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
immediately the first thing you'll

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.959 
immediately the first thing you'll
notice<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.170> g4<00:00:13.679> elite<00:00:13.710> utilizes<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> four

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
notice is the g4 elite utilizes a four

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.269 
notice is the g4 elite utilizes a four
panel<00:00:15.179> folding<00:00:15.630> system<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.470> allows<00:00:16.770> for

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
panel folding system which allows for

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.370 
panel folding system which allows for
75%<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> truck<00:00:18.359> bed<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.720> used<00:00:18.960> when

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
75% of the truck bed to be used when

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
75% of the truck bed to be used when
fully<00:00:19.619> stacked<00:00:19.890> whereas<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.150> solid<00:00:21.480> fold

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fully stacked whereas the solid fold

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.590 
fully stacked whereas the solid fold
only<00:00:22.170> uses<00:00:22.470> three<00:00:23.060> another<00:00:24.060> major<00:00:24.390> difference

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
only uses three another major difference

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 
only uses three another major difference
you'll<00:00:24.900> notice<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.800> process<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> takes<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you'll notice is the process it takes to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
you'll notice is the process it takes to
open<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> cover<00:00:51.649> now<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
open the cover now that we have the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
open the cover now that we have the
cover<00:00:53.219> open<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> solid

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
cover open we can see that the solid

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
cover open we can see that the solid
fold<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> rail<00:00:55.920> system<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
fold does not use a rail system this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
fold does not use a rail system this
means<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.480> cover<00:00:57.660> sits<00:00:57.960> directly<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> bed

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
means the cover sits directly on the bed

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.910 
means the cover sits directly on the bed
rails<00:00:59.210> this<00:01:00.210> allows<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.510> dirt<00:01:00.930> sand<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
rails this allows for dirt sand and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
rails this allows for dirt sand and
other<00:01:02.280> abrasive<00:01:02.760> material<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.600> collect

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
other abrasive material to collect

beneath the cover over time this will

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.920 
beneath the cover over time this will
damage<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> finish<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.799> truck<00:01:07.950> bed
