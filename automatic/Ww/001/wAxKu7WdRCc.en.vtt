 Colombians raúl blanco and anus garzón who 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.939
 celebrates its ten years of life by opening 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.939
 its doors to contemporary creators 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.550
 if he had to choose a music 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.349
 to capture your photos it would be this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.600
 you listen where the rolling stones 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.879
 images that convey silence and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.040
 they pursue the hidden beauty of 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.500
 certain natural landscapes there are none of the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.510
 people define it as an hour where 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.670
 to be able to sting and highlight things that in a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
 first moment are not aesthetic in case 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.710
 alone they try to look for this cure form 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 the beauty 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.760
 I try to praise and emphasize things 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.440
 what 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.030
 I do not know for whom he has to take a picture 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.049
 there from a grove to a pattern 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.970
 long then you can leave there will be no more 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.390
 plastics the tower will be called we use 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.710
 now I work with a canon with a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.479
 truck March 5 main and then with 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.259
 film because I work with medium format 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.789
 different references and the truth that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.500
 although I am young and yes enough 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.569
 sportsman on the subject of photography 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 in the midst of the great michael kenna in 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.870
 the internet then the big ones are already 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.850
 as stellar 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.270
 on the other hand another that works in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.400
 black and white ours the politics and the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.820
 nostalgia of white start at the time 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.430
 of the processing and other the white the black 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.220
 is grateful to the positive let that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.720
 extract a lot and then there is the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.350
 prayer and the passage to digital the truth 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.990
 is that I did not think about it, it convinces me 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 quite the black and white finish and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.530
 makes the absence of color also me 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.200
 makes you focus more on others 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 aspects when analyzing light 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.570
 more technical aspects of composition and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.430
 But let's go, I'm telling you, no 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.630
 they're going to discard because lately it's what 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 which is what I'm focused
