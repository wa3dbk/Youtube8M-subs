should have an advantage not wrong with
the<00:00:31.590> robotics<00:00:32.009> facility<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.430> he's<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.669> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the robotics facility so he's going to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.280 
the robotics facility so he's going to
be<00:00:32.820> producing<00:00:33.149> rivers<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.690> once<00:00:34.200> he

gets his reported support pay up and
that's<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.210> hard

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

the hardness back to defend it any
successfully<00:01:08.700> defends<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.119> July<00:01:09.240> realized

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
successfully defends it so July realized

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.880 
successfully defends it so July realized
that<00:01:09.840> he<00:01:09.930> needs<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> third<00:01:10.409> base<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.770> well

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that he needs the third base as well

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
that he needs the third base as well
because<00:01:11.460> neither<00:01:11.610> eyes<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.119> bases<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because neither eyes got three bases you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
because neither eyes got three bases you
can't<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.409> azure<00:01:13.680> player<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.010> less<00:01:14.220> basis

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
can't as azure player have less basis

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.580 
can't as azure player have less basis
than<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> Protoss<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> still<00:01:15.450> hope<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> win<00:01:15.869> now

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
than a Protoss and still hope to win now

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
than a Protoss and still hope to win now
right<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.369> made<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.790> robotics<00:01:18.240> facility

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
right now has made to robotics facility

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
right now has made to robotics facility
so<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> looks<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.049> he's<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> cross

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so it looks like he's going for a cross

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
so it looks like he's going for a cross
a<00:01:19.950> river<00:01:20.130> strategy<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.090> feel<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> July

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a river strategy and I do feel that July

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.910 
a river strategy and I do feel that July
is<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.229> vulnerable<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
is going to be very vulnerable to that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
is going to be very vulnerable to that
once<00:01:23.220> an<00:01:23.310> hour<00:01:23.369> i<00:01:23.520> guess<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> disruption<00:01:24.270> web

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
once an hour i guess that disruption web

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060 
once an hour i guess that disruption web
up<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.170> I've<00:01:25.380> continued<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> build<00:01:25.890> more

taking that base out I have to say that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
taking that base out I have to say that

are<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:22.350> might<00:02:22.500> try<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.770> take<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.980> camera

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
are you might try and take that camera

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.410 
are you might try and take that camera
but<00:02:23.340> i<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.610> kind<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.910> might<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.300> be

out<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.600> range<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.900> those<00:02:25.020> heartless<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.500> I'm

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
out of range of those heartless so I'm

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.870 
out of range of those heartless so I'm
not<00:02:25.710> sure<00:02:25.830> exactly<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.310> even<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> just

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
not sure exactly and even if you just

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.920 
not sure exactly and even if you just
take<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.030> cannon<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.420> neither<00:02:27.570> i<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.810> just

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
take that cannon out neither i can just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.090 
take that cannon out neither i can just
build<00:02:28.110> another<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:28.320> behind<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> pylon<00:02:28.980> and

Allah's middle line in his natural
expansion<00:05:03.340> at<00:05:03.699> the<00:05:03.849> middle<00:05:04.090> at<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.330> mid<00:05:04.479> lane

expansion at the middle at the mid lane

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.779 
expansion at the middle at the mid lane
and<00:05:04.840> July<00:05:05.199> now<00:05:05.440> realizes<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.310> he<00:05:06.460> needs<00:05:06.699> to

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
and July now realizes that he needs to

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.249 
and July now realizes that he needs to
take<00:05:06.969> that<00:05:07.030> middle<00:05:07.479> he<00:05:07.659> needs<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:07.990> take<00:05:08.080> that

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
take that middle he needs to take that

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.629 
take that middle he needs to take that
middle<00:05:08.469> base<00:05:08.590> just<00:05:08.800> outside<00:05:08.919> his<00:05:09.340> main<00:05:09.550> he

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
middle base just outside his main he

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.980 
middle base just outside his main he
needs<00:05:09.819> to<00:05:09.879> take<00:05:10.030> that<00:05:10.060> out<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.780> only<00:05:10.870> way

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
needs to take that out and the only way

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.330 
needs to take that out and the only way
I<00:05:11.110> think<00:05:11.349> he<00:05:11.409> knew<00:05:11.469> that<00:05:11.530> if<00:05:11.650> he<00:05:11.830> does<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.009> dual

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
I think he knew that if he does a dual

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.680 
I think he knew that if he does a dual
attack<00:05:12.789> from<00:05:13.000> both<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.300> front<00:05:13.419> in<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.659> back

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
attack from both the front in the back

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.180 
attack from both the front in the back
it<00:05:14.050> looks<00:05:14.409> like<00:05:14.530> he's<00:05:14.650> setting<00:05:14.889> up<00:05:14.979> with<00:05:15.099> that

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
it looks like he's setting up with that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.499 
it looks like he's setting up with that
when<00:05:15.340> he's<00:05:15.460> dropping<00:05:15.789> those<00:05:15.849> heartless<00:05:16.120> into

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
when he's dropping those heartless into

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.540 
when he's dropping those heartless into
that<00:05:16.629> middle<00:05:16.810> lane<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.740> actually<00:05:18.370> no<00:05:18.460> it

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
that middle lane and actually no it

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.529 
that middle lane and actually no it
doesn't<00:05:18.759> look<00:05:18.789> like<00:05:18.969> he's<00:05:19.090> going<00:05:19.240> for<00:05:19.419> that

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
doesn't look like he's going for that

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.180 
doesn't look like he's going for that
he's<00:05:19.659> just<00:05:19.690> gonna<00:05:19.990> please<00:05:20.469> I<00:05:20.590> he's<00:05:20.800> loading<00:05:21.069> up

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
he's just gonna please I he's loading up

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.010 
he's just gonna please I he's loading up
more<00:05:21.370> hardness<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.360> he<00:05:22.419> does<00:05:22.900> look

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
more hardness in that so he does look

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.050 
more hardness in that so he does look
like<00:05:23.139> he's<00:05:23.259> going<00:05:23.409> for<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.590> job<00:05:23.770> but<00:05:24.610> not<00:05:24.759> I<00:05:24.789> can

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
like he's going for a job but not I can

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.459 
like he's going for a job but not I can
end<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.240> drop<00:05:25.479> very<00:05:25.659> effectively<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.259> he<00:05:26.349> can

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
end that drop very effectively if he can

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.649 
end that drop very effectively if he can
scout<00:05:26.740> with<00:05:26.919> his<00:05:27.039> horses<00:05:27.849> but<00:05:28.029> those<00:05:28.150> hydrants

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
scout with his horses but those hydrants

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:29.610 
scout with his horses but those hydrants
that<00:05:28.750> are<00:05:28.840> already<00:05:28.960> are<00:05:29.229> going<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.409> prevent

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
that are already are going to prevent

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.749 
that are already are going to prevent
him<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:29.919> guys<00:05:30.039> reinforce<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.580> he's

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
him and you guys reinforce that he's

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.490 
him and you guys reinforce that he's
dropping<00:05:31.000> more<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.240> more<00:05:31.389> hydrogen<00:05:32.199> in<00:05:32.380> that

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
dropping more and more hydrogen in that

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.089 
dropping more and more hydrogen in that
so<00:05:32.620> he<00:05:32.770> has<00:05:33.190> cut<00:05:33.490> off<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:34.029> path<00:05:34.210> from<00:05:34.479> navroz

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
so he has cut off the path from navroz

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.499 
so he has cut off the path from navroz
middle<00:05:36.099> expansion<00:05:36.520> at<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.699> top<00:05:36.909> to<00:05:37.479> the

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
middle expansion at the top to the

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.029 
middle expansion at the top to the
middle<00:05:37.779> expansion<00:05:38.169> outside<00:05:38.500> his<00:05:38.650> own<00:05:38.770> main

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
middle expansion outside his own main

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.890 
middle expansion outside his own main
and<00:05:39.279> therefore<00:05:40.060> i'm<00:05:40.180> loosin<00:05:40.449> loud<00:05:40.599> july<00:05:40.870> is

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
and therefore i'm loosin loud july is

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.999 
and therefore i'm loosin loud july is
going<00:05:41.169> for<00:05:41.319> another<00:05:41.440> as<00:05:41.650> explained<00:05:41.919> and

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
going for another as explained and

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.320 
going for another as explained and
that's<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.190> bit<00:05:42.310> silly<00:05:42.460> he's<00:05:42.880> going<00:05:43.060> for<00:05:43.270> a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
that's a bit silly he's going for a

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.589 
that's a bit silly he's going for a
knowledge<00:05:43.779> expansion<00:05:44.520> at<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.669> north<00:05:45.849> in<00:05:46.449> the

knowledge expansion at the north in the

knowledge expansion at the north in the
middle<00:05:46.810> lane<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.110> that's<00:05:47.229> very<00:05:47.349> silly

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
middle lane and that's very silly

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.629 
middle lane and that's very silly
because<00:05:47.740> knowledge<00:05:48.039> but<00:05:48.190> loads<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.430> rivers

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
because knowledge but loads of rivers

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.529 
because knowledge but loads of rivers
there<00:05:48.759> i<00:05:48.789> guess<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.029> lie<00:05:49.120> doesn't<00:05:49.300> know<00:05:49.509> that

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
there i guess you lie doesn't know that

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.629 
there i guess you lie doesn't know that
banana<00:05:50.169> has<00:05:50.440> at<00:05:50.620> least<00:05:50.770> three<00:05:50.949> weavers<00:05:51.490> there

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
banana has at least three weavers there

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.649 
banana has at least three weavers there
that's<00:05:51.819> gonna<00:05:51.909> be<00:05:52.060> very<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:52.300> got<00:05:52.419> five

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
that's gonna be very it's got five

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.850 
that's gonna be very it's got five
rivers<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.229> that's<00:05:53.349> gonna<00:05:53.440> be<00:05:53.560> very<00:05:53.620> very

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
rivers and that's gonna be very very

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.409 
rivers and that's gonna be very very
difficult<00:05:54.069> for<00:05:54.310> july<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.669> actually<00:05:55.029> stop<00:05:55.240> that

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
difficult for july to actually stop that

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.300 
difficult for july to actually stop that
non-res<00:05:55.779> five<00:05:56.110> rivers<00:05:56.319> so<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:56.979> hardness<00:05:57.250> of

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
non-res five rivers so this hardness of

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.709 
non-res five rivers so this hardness of
good<00:05:57.430> ways<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.849> july<00:05:58.090> okay<00:05:58.360> that<00:05:58.509> looks<00:05:58.599> like

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
good ways and july okay that looks like

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.360 
good ways and july okay that looks like
that<00:05:58.779> was<00:05:58.990> actually<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.289> fake<00:05:59.529> but<00:06:00.039> laura<00:06:00.190> has

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
that was actually a fake but laura has

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.619 
that was actually a fake but laura has
to<00:06:00.520> has<00:06:00.639> Reapers<00:06:00.909> you're<00:06:01.000> joining<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.389> troop

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
to has Reapers you're joining the troop

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.879 
to has Reapers you're joining the troop
two-pronged<00:06:02.289> attack<00:06:02.379> he's<00:06:02.620> not<00:06:02.710> gonna<00:06:02.800> be
