00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
granted I mean it's a pretty steep hill

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
granted I mean it's a pretty steep hill
it<00:00:44.399> slowed<00:00:44.610> me<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.300> ten<00:00:45.690> or

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
it slowed me down to about ten or
fifteen<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.010> stop<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.910> was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
fifteen but it did not stop that was

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
fifteen but it did not stop that was
that<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.350> something<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> Marvel<00:00:50.160> I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.020 
there I've been missing there's like a
spring<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> something<00:01:14.520> else<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.850> goes<00:01:14.970> on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
spring and something else that goes on

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
spring and something else that goes on
the<00:01:15.270> front<00:01:15.299> I've<00:01:15.810> never<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.470> those<00:01:16.710> parts<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but anyway something I was pretty

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
but anyway something I was pretty
interesting<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.189> air

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
interesting was that there was an air

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
interesting was that there was an air
leak<00:01:23.610> between<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.119> head<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> cylinder

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
leak between the head and the cylinder

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.060 
leak between the head and the cylinder
when<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> bought<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.470> bike

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
when I bought this bike

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730 
when I bought this bike
first<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.540> most<00:01:27.840> mopeds<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> worked

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
first off I'm like most mopeds I worked

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
first off I'm like most mopeds I worked
on<00:01:29.689> there's<00:01:30.689> only<00:01:30.990> three<00:01:31.650> head<00:01:31.950> nuts<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on there's only three head nuts right

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
on there's only three head nuts right
there<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> triangle

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
there like a kind of like a triangle

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
there like a kind of like a triangle
formation<00:01:34.740> third<00:01:35.579> ones<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
formation third ones down there if you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.190 
formation third ones down there if you
can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:37.890> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.460> unusual<00:01:39.200> but

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
can see it so that's kind of unusual but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.539 
can see it so that's kind of unusual but
that<00:01:40.259> wasn't<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> problem<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.490> much

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that wasn't really the problem so much

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
that wasn't really the problem so much
is<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.119> came<00:01:42.270> from<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> factory

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
is that this came from the factory

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.460 
is that this came from the factory
without<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> head<00:01:43.439> gasket<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.420> luckily<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.780> was

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
without a head gasket and luckily I was

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.380 
without a head gasket and luckily I was
able<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> buy<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.100> online<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.880> guess<00:01:48.149> some

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
able to buy one online I guess some

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.210 
able to buy one online I guess some
mopeds<00:01:48.780> did<00:01:49.020> come<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.070> did

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
mopeds did come with one and some did

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.679 
mopeds did come with one and some did
not

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
not

and putting a head gasket on there and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
and putting a head gasket on there and

had<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> exhaust<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:01:59.820> not<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
had was it the exhaust and I'm not the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
had was it the exhaust and I'm not the
biggest<00:02:00.540> fan<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.960> way<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.320> mounts<00:02:01.890> and

biggest fan of the way this mounts and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
biggest fan of the way this mounts and
you<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.939> get

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you see if I can get

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.080 
you see if I can get
there's<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.439> clamp<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.430> now

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
there's a little clamp right there now

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
there's a little clamp right there now
I've<00:02:06.240> seen<00:02:06.420> pictures<00:02:06.630> online<00:02:07.200> people<00:02:07.500> buy

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
I've seen pictures online people buy

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.639 
I've seen pictures online people buy
better<00:02:08.009> clamps<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> put<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
better clamps to put on there but the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.470 
better clamps to put on there but the
clamp<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.370> doing<00:02:11.730> its<00:02:11.849> job<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.450> wasn't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
clamp was doing its job just wasn't

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.820 
clamp was doing its job just wasn't
sealing<00:02:13.319> very<00:02:13.560> well<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.720> ended<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.840> getting

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
sealing very well so I ended up getting

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.640 
sealing very well so I ended up getting
some<00:02:17.310> Permatex<00:02:18.090> copper<00:02:18.569> stuff<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> ice<00:02:19.230> going

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
some Permatex copper stuff and ice going

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.460 
some Permatex copper stuff and ice going
to<00:02:19.709> squeeze<00:02:20.099> tube<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.690> put<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.140> all

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
to squeeze tube and I put that all

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.110 
to squeeze tube and I put that all
around<00:02:22.920> there<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.340> put<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.610> clamp<00:02:23.910> on

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
around there and then put the clamp on

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.420 
around there and then put the clamp on
and<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.720> fixed<00:02:25.050> up<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.430> exhaust

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and that actually fixed up that exhaust

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
and that actually fixed up that exhaust
leak<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.910> nicely<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:27.989> put<00:02:28.140> your

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
leak really nicely when you put your

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.809 
leak really nicely when you put your
hand<00:02:28.500> underneath<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.400> still<00:02:29.610> feel

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
hand underneath there you can still feel

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.460 
hand underneath there you can still feel
air<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.390> that's<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:30.660> there's<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.019> fan<00:02:31.290> on

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
air but that's because there's a fan on

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.800 
air but that's because there's a fan on
the<00:02:31.590> other<00:02:31.709> side<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.360> made<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.630> video

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the other side now and I made this video

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.479 
the other side now and I made this video
originally<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.440> said<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.739> seat<00:02:34.980> was<00:02:35.099> falling

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
originally I said the seat was falling

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.030 
originally I said the seat was falling
off<00:02:35.670> well<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.480> totally<00:02:36.780> true<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
off well that's not totally true the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.710 
off well that's not totally true the
upholstery<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.880> kind<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.120> separated

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
upholstery is just kind of separated

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.259 
upholstery is just kind of separated
from<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.200> actual<00:02:41.190> seat<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.910> previous

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
from the actual seat so the previous

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.000 
from the actual seat so the previous
owner<00:02:42.480> duct-taped<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.380> anyway<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> found

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
owner duct-taped it but anyway I found

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.740 
owner duct-taped it but anyway I found
something<00:02:44.430> kind<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.760> curious<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.390> here

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
something kind of curious out here

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.270 
something kind of curious out here
there's<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.950> compartment

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
there's actually a compartment

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
there's actually a compartment
underneath<00:02:47.819> here<00:02:48.180> me<00:02:48.360> show<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.599> what<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.750> found

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
underneath here me show you what I found

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.970 
underneath here me show you what I found
inside<00:02:49.849> I've<00:02:50.849> got<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.299> lever<00:02:51.599> right<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:54.980> so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
inside I've got this lever right here so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.410 
inside I've got this lever right here so
this<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.430> cool<00:02:56.640> someone<00:02:57.180> left<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
this is kind of cool someone left the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.690 
this is kind of cool someone left the
hose<00:02:57.569> clamp<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.670> oil

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
hose clamp in there and then the oil

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.699 
hose clamp in there and then the oil
mixing<00:03:00.299> cup<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.810> here<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
mixing cup right here but this is the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.809 
mixing cup right here but this is the
real<00:03:01.890> treat

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.069 

really<00:03:05.849> entangled<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.450> there<00:03:06.630> hang<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:09.079> watch

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
really entangled in there hang on watch

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:18.830 
really entangled in there hang on watch
before<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:11.780> alright<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:17.780> getting<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
before you get alright this getting the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.289 
before you get alright this getting the
light<00:03:19.049> here<00:03:19.410> looks<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.160> an<00:03:20.310> original<00:03:20.670> tube

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
light here looks like an original tube

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.099 
light here looks like an original tube
of<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.889> Vespa<00:03:22.889> mix<00:03:23.150> or<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.329> just<00:03:24.450> fill<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> tank

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
of a Vespa mix or you just fill the tank

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.569 
of a Vespa mix or you just fill the tank
and<00:03:25.319> then<00:03:25.410> dump<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:25.980> whole<00:03:26.160> thing<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
and then dump in this whole thing and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.190 
and then dump in this whole thing and
that's<00:03:26.790> fifty<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:27.510> one<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:27.930> would<00:03:28.019> make

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that's fifty to one which would make

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.520 
that's fifty to one which would make
sense<00:03:28.500> because<00:03:29.420> 2.6<00:03:30.420> ounces<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.139> gallon

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
sense because 2.6 ounces is one gallon

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.900 
sense because 2.6 ounces is one gallon
that<00:03:31.560> tank<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.040> less<00:03:32.220> than<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.489> gallon<00:03:32.819> this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
that tank is less than one gallon this

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.599 
that tank is less than one gallon this
tube<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.329> 1.9<00:03:33.959> ounces<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.239> Wow<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:38.370> at<00:03:38.459> that

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
tube is 1.9 ounces but Wow look at that
