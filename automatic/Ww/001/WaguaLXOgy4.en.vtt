 annotations and in the description under the roller once 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 McVeigh so you do not like it then I found 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 I looked at this video and then all the same 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:10.860
 in the end there is some kind of small 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 raisin no oh well you are you 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 it turns out why when I will now 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 I have no brain with tea 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.830
 cerebral with someone to type well, but why 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.359
 the good old meat grinder new evil 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.729
 dangling barrett rifle 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.189
 many have already forgotten what a battle on 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.740
 bolts like this no knives pistols 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.630
 and so on but lord lawrence who 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 ranked fourth in todays 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.069
 top he reminds that no grenades 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 pistols and knives but nobody 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.679
 listens to plays like he wants jura did 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.899
 almost 9 kills a pretty good combo 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.969
 in a meat grinder is very sorry that the last 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.950
 the enemy who went at him with a gun 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.590
 he just simply did not finish off the same 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:05.420
 the most pistol or knife I 4th place 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 not bad, but I knew, but I'm right here 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.610
 third place we have legs you rhyme 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.310

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.260
 beautiful straight one hundred percent accurate triple 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.690
 kill triple kill on exploding it always 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.940
 beautiful fourth frag but to be honest 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.190
 so-so well here's the fifth engineer by he 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.660
 took straight young man it was warming up 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.660

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.290
 cheytac m200 but where do you get it 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.510

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.349
 if you have a skill roller well 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.510
 preferably could not melanoma with 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.640
 any other interesting new 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.829
 it is desirable that you can 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.260
 throw this movie special topic in 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.150

 description under this video well, go 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.870
 to the second place while i was saying this 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.239
 It takes quite a long way 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.310
 time russia champion is played macnilla 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.680
 us from the clan of dark meters made already three 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.959
 killings where now goes for fourth to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.079
 Unfortunately, the Russian champion did not reach 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.150
 first place just like kicks but all 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.069

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.650
 notice, for example, how he plays and 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:29.970
 how to choose the position of this movie me 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.379
 impressed and ranked first 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.510
 sniper under the nickname then went 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.310
 holding macmillan but not that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.560
 the previous two commercials here and we 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.870
 it turned out to make even such 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.849
 Little Ninja Defuse Patent 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.799
 and make 6 kills and 7 against it 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.019
 played even kalika who left him 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.940
 literally so little 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.739
 loop of life to me this video 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.590
 Liked most I decided it 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.900
 put in first place and you can 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.760
 something to object to me 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.470
