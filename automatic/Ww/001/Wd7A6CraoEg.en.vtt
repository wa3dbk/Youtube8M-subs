00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.330 
but don't give up and that turned out to
be<00:03:22.190> pretty<00:03:22.370> good<00:03:22.640> advice<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:24.050> Logan<00:03:24.800> and

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
be pretty good advice so Logan and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.490 
be pretty good advice so Logan and
epperson<00:03:26.150> they<00:03:26.330> were<00:03:26.480> having<00:03:26.810> some<00:03:27.020> problems

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
epperson they were having some problems

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.740 
epperson they were having some problems
because<00:03:28.120> Epperson<00:03:29.120> didn't<00:03:29.420> really

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
because Epperson didn't really

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.380 
because Epperson didn't really
understand<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> challenge<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.640> don't

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
understand the challenge and I don't

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.960 
understand the challenge and I don't
think<00:03:32.600> Logan<00:03:33.110> really<00:03:33.410> did<00:03:33.620> either<00:03:33.970> even

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
think Logan really did either even

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.510 
think Logan really did either even
though<00:03:35.000> he<00:03:35.660> said<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:35.960> was<00:03:36.320> because<00:03:36.500> his<00:03:36.980> client

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
though he said it was because his client

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.060 
though he said it was because his client
wanted<00:03:37.880> pants<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.020> really<00:03:39.770> were

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
wanted pants but you really were

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.550 
wanted pants but you really were
supposed<00:03:40.490> to<00:03:40.670> use<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.660> bulk<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> dress

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
strategy was to use his little of the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.490 
strategy was to use his little of the
dress<00:03:53.990> as<00:03:54.200> possible<00:03:55.240> so<00:03:56.240> he<00:03:56.270> was<00:03:57.140> kind<00:03:57.230> of

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
dress as possible so he was kind of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500 
dress as possible so he was kind of
feeling<00:03:57.770> guilty<00:03:58.310> i<00:03:58.340> guess<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:58.940> he<00:03:59.090> went<00:03:59.209> back

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
feeling guilty i guess so he went back

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.020 
feeling guilty i guess so he went back
and<00:03:59.840> changed<00:04:00.200> his<00:04:00.500> design<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.880> would
