hi<00:00:02.909> I'm<00:00:03.480> Oscar<00:00:03.659> fan<00:00:03.929> Dave<00:00:04.080> hunter<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.950> is

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
hi I'm Oscar fan Dave hunter and this is

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.120 
hi I'm Oscar fan Dave hunter and this is
Bram's<00:00:05.520> fortress<00:00:06.140> brims<00:00:07.140> fortress<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.830> an<00:00:07.950> ID

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Bram's fortress brims fortress is an ID

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.629 
Bram's fortress brims fortress is an ID
by<00:00:08.610> Bram<00:00:09.480> Cohen<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.800> Rubik's<00:00:11.550> Cube

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
by Bram Cohen and it's a Rubik's Cube

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.070 
by Bram Cohen and it's a Rubik's Cube
again<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.540> gears<00:00:15.949> as<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.340> see<00:00:18.080> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
again with gears as you can see the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.980 
again with gears as you can see the
there<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.560> gears<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> sides<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
there are gears at all the sides of the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
there are gears at all the sides of the
puzzle

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
puzzle

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.880 
puzzle
so<00:00:22.949> these<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.519> eight<00:00:24.510> independent<00:00:25.050> Rubik's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so these are eight independent Rubik's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
so these are eight independent Rubik's
cubes<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.820> course<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.300> connected

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
cubes but of course they are connected

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.950 
cubes but of course they are connected
by<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> gear<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.550> when<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> make<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> turn<00:00:30.359> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
by this gear so when I make a turn you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.620 
by this gear so when I make a turn you
see<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> parts<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.520> turn<00:00:32.790> together

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
see all the parts they turn together

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.220 
see all the parts they turn together
this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.350> mid<00:00:35.190> turn<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> way

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this is mid turn and this is all the way

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.180 
this is mid turn and this is all the way
to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> end<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.540> well<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.190> it's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to the end and well you see it's it's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
to the end and well you see it's it's
quite<00:00:41.760> stiff<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.450> also<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> reason<00:00:43.020> why

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
quite stiff this is also the reason why

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
quite stiff this is also the reason why
I'm<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.500> putting<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.730> sale<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.480> at

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
I'm not putting it for sale with at

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.709 
I'm not putting it for sale with at
least<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> proof<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> principle<00:00:47.210> it<00:00:48.210> works

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
least as a proof of principle it works

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
least as a proof of principle it works
and<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.860> stiffness<00:00:52.969> well

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and you see with a lot of stiffness well

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
and you see with a lot of stiffness well
if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> poor<00:00:55.890> prototype

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
if you think this is a poor prototype

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.170 
if you think this is a poor prototype
this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> number<00:00:57.239> three<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.770> line<00:00:59.030> this<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
this is number three in the line this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.929 
this is number three in the line this is
my<00:01:01.079> prototype<00:01:02.010> number<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:04.680> one

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
my prototype number one and this one

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
my prototype number one and this one
it's<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.290> smoother<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> problem<00:01:08.549> with

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's much smoother but the problem with

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's much smoother but the problem with
prototype<00:01:09.210> number<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.189> parts<00:01:11.189> tend

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
prototype number one is that parts tend

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.660 
prototype number one is that parts tend
to<00:01:12.210> derail<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.100> locks<00:01:17.400> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to derail so you see it if it locks up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
to derail so you see it if it locks up
at<00:01:17.880> places<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.340> well<00:01:20.340> prototype<00:01:21.000> number<00:01:21.720> two

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
at places and well prototype number two

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.399 
at places and well prototype number two
here's<00:01:23.009> some<00:01:23.189> parts<00:01:23.520> let's<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.960> started

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
here's some parts let's not get started

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.260 
here's some parts let's not get started
with<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> total<00:01:27.060> failure

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
with that one that was a total failure

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
with that one that was a total failure
so<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> third<00:01:31.200> prototype<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.950> it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
so this is the third prototype and it's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.450 
so this is the third prototype and it's
still<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:36.030> working<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.310> know

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
still not working so I really don't know

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
still not working so I really don't know
we<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.689> puzzle<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:41.549> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
we have to go from this puzzle and as I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.990 
we have to go from this puzzle and as I
say<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.450> putting<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.680> sale<00:01:43.860> yet<00:01:44.040> one

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
say I'm not putting it for sale yet one

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230 
say I'm not putting it for sale yet one
solution<00:01:45.600> maybe<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.860> twice<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.460> big

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
solution maybe to make it twice as big

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.859 
solution maybe to make it twice as big
like<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.500> huge<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.090> course<00:01:51.360> twice<00:01:51.659> as

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
like this huge but of course twice as

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.889 
like this huge but of course twice as
big<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.619> 3d<00:01:53.280> printing<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.630> means

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
big you know with 3d printing it means

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.639 
big you know with 3d printing it means
eight<00:01:55.170> times<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.829> expensive<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:58.259> question

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
eight times as expensive so my question

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.179 
eight times as expensive so my question
is<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> happen<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> spare<00:02:01.189> 1400

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
is do you happen to have a spare 1400

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.149 
is do you happen to have a spare 1400
euros<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> spend<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
euros and do you want to spend it on a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.180 
euros and do you want to spend it on a
really<00:02:05.460> huge<00:02:05.700> prototype<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.990> brand<00:02:07.680> fortress

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
really huge prototype of brand fortress

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.390 
really huge prototype of brand fortress
if<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.940> please<00:02:09.479> contact<00:02:09.750> me<00:02:10.140> thank<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.220> for
