00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
then this is the team and I don't

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.500 
then this is the team and I don't
necessarily<00:01:37.310> think<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.520> leaves<00:01:37.760> any<00:01:37.940> doubt

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
necessarily think that leaves any doubt

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.170 
necessarily think that leaves any doubt
in<00:01:38.630> anybody's<00:01:38.870> mind<00:01:39.130> Scotty<00:01:40.130> I'm<00:01:40.340> not<00:01:41.030> too

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
in anybody's mind Scotty I'm not too

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.910 
in anybody's mind Scotty I'm not too
sure<00:01:41.390> team<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.900> seems<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:42.320> he<00:01:42.440> must<00:01:42.620> retire

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
sure team of seems like he must retire

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.850 
sure team of seems like he must retire
but<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:44.840> know<00:01:44.960> again<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.350> never<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.560> what

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
but you know again you never know what

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.350 
but you know again you never know what
what<00:01:46.190> happens<00:01:46.490> over<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> couple<00:01:46.970> months<00:01:47.060> it's

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
what happens over a couple months it's

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.390 
what happens over a couple months it's
certainly<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:48.170> think<00:01:48.650> everybody<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.160> locker

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
certainly I think everybody that locker

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400 
certainly I think everybody that locker
understands<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.120> going<00:01:50.600> forward<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.930> team

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
understands it going forward the team

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.400 
understands it going forward the team
and<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.340> know<00:01:52.430> if<00:01:52.550> anything<00:01:52.910> else<00:01:53.000> happens

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
and you know if anything else happens

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.510 
and you know if anything else happens
we'll<00:01:54.410> treat<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.650> much<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.040> deadline<00:01:55.340> deal

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
we'll treat it much like a deadline deal

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550 
we'll treat it much like a deadline deal
okay<00:01:56.090> very<00:01:56.270> quickly<00:01:56.479> obviously<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.200> cliche

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay very quickly obviously the cliche

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.350 
okay very quickly obviously the cliche
they're<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.010> were<00:01:58.160> two<00:01:58.400> points<00:01:58.790> but<00:01:58.970> how

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
they're all were two points but how

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.820 
they're all were two points but how
difficult<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.200> put<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> same<00:02:00.800> amount

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
difficult is it to put the same amount

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.860 
difficult is it to put the same amount
of<00:02:01.160> emphasis<00:02:01.550> on<00:02:01.729> games<00:02:02.000> in<00:02:02.180> October<00:02:02.720> as

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
of emphasis on games in October as

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.200 
of emphasis on games in October as
opposed<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.440> ones<00:02:03.620> in<00:02:03.860> May<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.850> April

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
opposed to the ones in May and in April

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.700 
opposed to the ones in May and in April
and<00:02:05.330> really<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.930> last<00:02:06.050> few<00:02:06.320> years<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
and really the last few years the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.320 
and really the last few years the
standard<00:02:07.040> Cup<00:02:07.160> champion<00:02:07.550> has<00:02:07.700> been<00:02:07.940> able<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
standard Cup champion has been able to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.180 
standard Cup champion has been able to
do<00:02:08.540> that<00:02:08.810> are<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.260> guys<00:02:09.470> able<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.830> do<00:02:10.040> that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
do that are you guys able to do that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.040 
do that are you guys able to do that
well<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.270> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.930> key

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
well I think that's going to be the key

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.710 
well I think that's going to be the key
for<00:02:12.290> us<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> first<00:02:13.040> 10<00:02:13.940> or<00:02:14.030> 15<00:02:14.330> games<00:02:14.570> is

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
for us here the first 10 or 15 games is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.330 
for us here the first 10 or 15 games is
to<00:02:14.840> get<00:02:14.959> off<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> summer<00:02:15.500> status<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.040> had<00:02:16.160> last

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
to get off to summer status we had last

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.920 
to get off to summer status we had last
year<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.910> focus<00:02:17.300> back<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.690> we<00:02:17.780> had

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
year get that focus back that we had

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.180 
year get that focus back that we had
last<00:02:18.140> year<00:02:19.090> where<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.800> pushed<00:02:21.800> forward

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
last year where we just pushed forward

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
last year where we just pushed forward
and<00:02:22.370> no<00:02:22.880> matter<00:02:23.030> what<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.780> thrown<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.110> front

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and no matter what got thrown in front

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.020 
and no matter what got thrown in front
of<00:02:24.410> us<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.680> were<00:02:24.739> playing<00:02:25.400> very<00:02:25.670> well<00:02:25.850> we're

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
of us we were playing very well we're

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.000 
of us we were playing very well we're
getting<00:02:26.270> great<00:02:26.360> goaltending<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.320> we're

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
getting great goaltending and and we're

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.410 
getting great goaltending and and we're
getting<00:02:28.220> timely<00:02:28.430> goal<00:02:28.670> scoring<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.239> those

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
getting timely goal scoring and those

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.000 
getting timely goal scoring and those
are<00:02:29.570> three<00:02:29.750> pretty<00:02:30.260> important<00:02:30.860> piece<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
are three pretty important piece of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.560 
are three pretty important piece of
skating<00:02:31.430> hockey<00:02:31.580> games<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.090> sleek<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
skating hockey games and sleek and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.330 
skating hockey games and sleek and
certainly<00:02:32.980> we're<00:02:33.980> getting<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> great

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
certainly we're getting a great

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.080 
certainly we're getting a great
goaltending<00:02:34.730> right<00:02:34.880> now<00:02:35.030> we're<00:02:35.720> small

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
goaltending right now we're small

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.089 
goaltending right now we're small
whew<00:02:36.300> timely<00:02:36.900> goals<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.069> just

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
whew timely goals and I think we just

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.050 
whew timely goals and I think we just
need<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.400> tighten<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> few<00:02:38.879> areas

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
need to tighten up a few areas

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.150 
need to tighten up a few areas
