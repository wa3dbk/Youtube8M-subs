have<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.240> quick<00:00:50.540> check<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.900> see<00:00:51.140> if<00:00:51.200> we<00:00:51.260> can

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
have a quick check to see if we can

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.930 
have a quick check to see if we can
diagnose<00:00:51.860> what<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.100> problem<00:00:52.520> is<00:00:52.640> with<00:00:52.790> our

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's asking us to either read the codes

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.620 
it's asking us to either read the codes
or<00:01:25.580> erase<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.940> codes<00:01:26.120> well<00:01:26.210> first<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.570> all

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
or erase the codes well first of all

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
or erase the codes well first of all
we're<00:01:26.780> gonna<00:01:26.840> read<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.230> codes<00:01:28.210> find<00:01:29.210> out

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
we're gonna read the codes find out

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.820 
we're gonna read the codes find out
where<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.630> problem<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:33.470> telling<00:01:33.740> us

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
where the problem is and it's telling us

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.820 
where the problem is and it's telling us
straight<00:01:34.070> away<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:35.170> there<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.350> problem

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
straight away that there is a problem

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.160 
straight away that there is a problem
with<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> city<00:01:37.520> seat<00:01:38.150> occupancy<00:01:38.630> detector

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
with the city seat occupancy detector

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.810 
with the city seat occupancy detector
the<00:01:42.170> belt<00:01:42.440> tensioner<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.159> front

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
the belt tensioner on the front

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.030 
the belt tensioner on the front
passenger<00:01:44.270> seat<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.530> what<00:01:45.680> we're<00:01:45.800> going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> do

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
passenger seat so what we're going to do

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.219 
passenger seat so what we're going to do
is<00:01:46.159> we're<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.430> check<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.700> out<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
is we're going to check that out the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.780 
is we're going to check that out the
chances<00:01:48.590> are<00:01:48.740> it's<00:01:48.830> probably<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.640> loose

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
chances are it's probably just a loose

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.120 
chances are it's probably just a loose
connection<00:01:50.290> but<00:01:51.290> either<00:01:51.350> way<00:01:51.530> we'll<00:01:51.710> check<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
connection but either way we'll check it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.440 
connection but either way we'll check it
out<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.549> then<00:01:53.000> we'll<00:01:53.180> come<00:01:53.450> back<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:55.330> try<00:01:56.330> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
out and then we'll come back and try and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.840 
out and then we'll come back and try and
erase<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.840> codes<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.010> airbag

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
erase the codes and see if the airbag

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.399 
erase the codes and see if the airbag
light<00:01:59.090> will<00:01:59.420> be<00:01:59.840> removed<00:02:00.170> from<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.409> dashboard

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
light will be removed from the dashboard

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.630 
light will be removed from the dashboard
so<00:02:03.409> now<00:02:03.590> back<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.070> vehicle

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
so now back in the vehicle

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.570 
so now back in the vehicle
but<00:02:05.510> unfortunately<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.950> airbag<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:07.460> is

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
but unfortunately the airbag right is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.880 
but unfortunately the airbag right is
still<00:02:07.729> showing<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.239> dashboard<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
still showing on the dashboard and that

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.619 
still showing on the dashboard and that
is<00:02:10.009> very<00:02:10.310> characteristic<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:11.239> what<00:02:11.450> will

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
is very characteristic of what will

the airbag system that can take sort of
up<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.070> 30<00:02:59.400> seconds<00:02:59.760> or<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> minute<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:01.130> this

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
up to 30 seconds or a minute or so this

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
up to 30 seconds or a minute or so this
one<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.790> doing<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.090> now<00:03:03.240> within<00:03:03.450> about

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
one here it's doing it now within about

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
one here it's doing it now within about
30<00:03:03.960> seconds<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.770> as<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.610> airbag
