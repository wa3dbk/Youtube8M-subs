surface rag rolling is a technique where
we<00:02:09.679> literally

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
we literally

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.570 
we literally
scrunch<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.200> rag<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.680> give<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.370> little

scrunch the rag up give it a little

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.110 
scrunch the rag up give it a little
twist<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:16.140> over<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
twist and go over the top so we get a
