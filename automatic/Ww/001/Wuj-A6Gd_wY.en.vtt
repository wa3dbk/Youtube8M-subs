flying everywhere whenever you self
explosives<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.370> it<00:01:22.030> even<00:01:22.150> works<00:01:22.420> if<00:01:22.750> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
explosives and it even works if you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.380 
explosives and it even works if you
spawn<00:01:23.950> something<00:01:24.340> like<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> creeper<00:01:24.970> if<00:01:25.120> i<00:01:25.210> can

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
spawn something like a creeper if i can

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.800 
spawn something like a creeper if i can
find<00:01:25.840> thing<00:01:26.770> there<00:01:27.250> we<00:01:27.370> are<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:28.390> if<00:01:28.510> i<00:01:28.600> go<00:01:28.630> down

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
find thing there we are so if i go down

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.030 
find thing there we are so if i go down
here<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.860> grow<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> creeper<00:01:32.040> watch

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
here then and I grow a creeper watch

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.240 
here then and I grow a creeper watch
this<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.080> see<00:01:35.320> stuff<00:01:35.860> went<00:01:36.070> flying

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
this you can see stuff went flying

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.810 
this you can see stuff went flying
everywhere<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.800> you<00:01:38.800> can<00:01:39.190> even<00:01:39.280> do<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:39.490> with

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
everywhere so you can even do this with

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250 
everywhere so you can even do this with
TNT<00:01:40.240> cannons<00:01:40.660> which<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.990> what<00:01:41.110> we're<00:01:41.230> doing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
TNT cannons which is what we're doing

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260 
TNT cannons which is what we're doing
here<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.010> this<00:01:42.160> is<00:01:42.190> if<00:01:42.460> we<00:01:42.640> have<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:43.120> an

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
a hundred percent right now so all the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.559 
a hundred percent right now so all the
