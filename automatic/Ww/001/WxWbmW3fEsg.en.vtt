00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.689
 to sequence phase three currents the collection 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.029
 in this sarasate space 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.999
 between the jumps 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.929
 I give them 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.910
 Terezinha says 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 we got three points high sp and the three chains we made to climb 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 was a year soon with four points 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.950
 two chains 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 law that comes here 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.240
 the same way 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 a crucial point 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.760
 two chains not even 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 more 4 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.710
 lorenz 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 4 paulo 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.690
 make two chains of prayer is born with 80 space next 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.460
 4 high points 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.560
 forming the central banker 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 between teams 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.850
 two patients I'm accepted 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.100
 repeating is about genk 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 Are you going to work like this until the end of your career? 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.380
 in points two chains 4 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 however if the same place 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 the child 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.790
 arriving at the end were two chains between two and now in the third chain 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.159
 of the first speck dot festival of chips 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 three currents psb and lacerda are now spoken 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 on the tip in front 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.339
 in the next 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:24.139
 in the next four high points with us airways we have two chains 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.989
 let's make two points such 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.329
 almost goal 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.189
 on the tips at the front or one for each note 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.929
 other details 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.929
 customers 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.789
 I ensured within the goal a team of the team will be 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:54.869
 two points only two current the arsenic wedge in the same place 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.089
 two points just there to be wildcard 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.789
 put on stitches again 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:06.669
 Until you get there. 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.669
 close to the cat 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
 repeating without having these procedures 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.749
 between the five goals 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.909
 a high point that with each current 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 and point on the point of leakage 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.919
 we reached the second grand slam of the season the side hit or missed 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.469
 a tall jacket 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.379
 in the same look was another high point 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.279
 two chains says lacerda 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.999
 within the range 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.669
 a high point 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.459
 In the same year 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.049
 the high point 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.230
 and I continued 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.230
 people that knew how to put until the end of the race 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 doing the same thing in all cases 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.489
 come to the end now translates to the third 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.879
 first point 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.589
 excellent with one more point and this 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.739
 three brasilia chains - classic 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.609
 What did you do? 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.609
 like we did in his previous career 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
 mercy james 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 until the corner 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 I was just going to stay classical 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.979
 the high point 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.439
 at the same time 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.439
 two chains lacerda 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.059
 the high point 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.059
 still within the ranking 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.919
 there to get involved and continue 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.919
 repeating the same thing in every corner 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.129
 You're going to keep working like this, I stay here with six careers. 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.309
 of total 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.770
 among other facts 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.770
 so four more careers out that says it all 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.990
 I stopped proc 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.390
 Do what I say no.
