turn your mode dial to a V a V stands
for<00:00:12.750> aperture<00:00:13.380> value<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.100> what<00:00:14.760> this<00:00:14.880> allows

for aperture value and what this allows

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.920 
for aperture value and what this allows
you<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:16.039> set<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.430> aperture<00:00:17.850> while<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
you to do is set the aperture while the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.950 
you to do is set the aperture while the
camera<00:00:19.470> sets<00:00:20.220> an<00:00:20.520> appropriate<00:00:21.360> shutter<00:00:21.600> speed

but somewhere in the middle is an
optimal<00:01:28.560> aperture<00:01:28.920> value<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.790> different

for<00:01:30.390> every<00:01:30.600> lens<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
for every lens that will get you the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.620

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
absolute sharpest picture

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
absolute sharpest picture
I<00:01:33.659> usually<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.560> worry<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.400> too

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
I usually don't worry about that too

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
I usually don't worry about that too
much<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.600> difference<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> focus<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
much because the difference in focus is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
much because the difference in focus is
very<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.159> subtle<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.090> will

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
very very subtle and you really will

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
very very subtle and you really will
have<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.659> look<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:39.840> close<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> image<00:01:40.950> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have to look very close at the image in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
have to look very close at the image in
order<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> softness<00:01:42.479> caused<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
order to see the softness caused by the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
order to see the softness caused by the
aperture<00:01:44.670> setting<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:46.200> think

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
aperture setting so really I don't think

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010 
aperture setting so really I don't think
about<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.220> too<00:01:47.430> much<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
about that too much all I think about is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
about that too much all I think about is
the<00:01:49.200> depth<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.560> field<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> get

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the depth of field that I'm going to get

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.380 
the depth of field that I'm going to get
with<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.299> larger<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.020> smaller<00:01:52.049> aperture<00:01:53.390> to
