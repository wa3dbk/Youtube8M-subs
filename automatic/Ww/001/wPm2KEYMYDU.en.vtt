00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.280 
without any hair out now that's the back
I<00:02:18.830> think<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.549> like<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> 18<00:02:20.450> inch<00:02:20.720> wig

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
I think this is like a 18 inch wig

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.309 
I think this is like a 18 inch wig
because<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.010> curly<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.760> goes<00:02:22.910> about<00:02:23.319> 18

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
because it is curly so it goes about 18

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.770 
because it is curly so it goes about 18
inches<00:02:24.620> when<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.069> pull<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.400> down<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.060> around

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
inches when you pull it down and around

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.020 
inches when you pull it down and around
14<00:02:27.560> 16<00:02:28.190> inches<00:02:28.609> when<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.090> curly<00:02:33.670> I'm<00:02:34.670> just

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
14 16 inches when it's curly I'm just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.240 
14 16 inches when it's curly I'm just
talking<00:02:35.480> talking<00:02:35.810> away<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.680> I'm<00:02:36.769> just<00:02:37.070> gonna

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
talking talking away but I'm just gonna

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.699 
talking talking away but I'm just gonna
take<00:02:37.579> some<00:02:37.609> of<00:02:37.880> my<00:02:38.090> natural<00:02:38.329> hair<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.900> around

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
take some of my natural hair out around

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.650 
take some of my natural hair out around
the<00:02:39.799> hairline<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.579> can<00:02:40.730> see<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
the hairline as you can see and that

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
the hairline as you can see and that
makes<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.049> look<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.260> little<00:02:42.410> bit<00:02:42.650> more<00:02:42.920> natural

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.569 

the<00:02:47.390> wig<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.959> too<00:02:48.230> shiny<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.980> me<00:02:49.010> either

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
the wig is not too shiny to me either

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.599 
the wig is not too shiny to me either
it<00:02:49.760> has<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.510> natural<00:02:50.750> sheen<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:51.950> unless

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
it has a natural sheen to it unless

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.539 
it has a natural sheen to it unless
there's<00:02:52.940> not<00:02:53.120> too<00:02:53.329> shiny<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.489> therefore<00:02:55.489> I

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
there's not too shiny and therefore I

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.050 
there's not too shiny and therefore I
don't<00:02:55.730> have<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.120> put<00:02:56.299> any<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:58.060> you

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
don't have to really put any of that you

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't have to really put any of that you
know<00:02:59.180> cornstarch<00:02:59.780> or<00:03:00.260> baby<00:03:00.530> powder<00:03:00.799> or

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
know cornstarch or baby powder or

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.370 
know cornstarch or baby powder or
anything<00:03:01.069> like<00:03:02.030> that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
anything like that

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.600 
anything like that
so<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.500> blends<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.950> pretty<00:03:04.190> well

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
so it blends in pretty well

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:29.949 
so it blends in pretty well
