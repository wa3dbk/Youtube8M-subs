these<00:01:59.670> button-down<00:02:00.210> shirts<00:02:00.570> or<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.990> sort<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
these button-down shirts or just sort of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.910 
these button-down shirts or just sort of
shapeless<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.880> move<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:03.920> really

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
shapeless and they don't move I really

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.690 
shapeless and they don't move I really
like<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.220> one<00:02:05.400> it<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:06.080> 315<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.620> with<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
like this one it was 315 so with the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 
like this one it was 315 so with the
fifty<00:02:09.119> percent<00:02:09.480> off<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.020> believe<00:02:10.710> that's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fifty percent off I believe that's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
fifty percent off I believe that's
something<00:02:11.490> like<00:02:11.730> um<00:02:14.090> 158<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:15.570> something<00:02:15.930> like

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
something like um 158 or something like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.130 
something like um 158 or something like
that<00:02:16.110> yeah<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.490> 158<00:02:21.140> I'm

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
that yeah I think it's like 158 I'm

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.860 
that yeah I think it's like 158 I'm
dropping<00:02:22.560> anything<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> next<00:02:24.660> thing

print<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:25.890> hoping<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.520> find

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940

print here so I'm hoping that I can find
some<00:03:27.209> way<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> incorporate<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.260> into<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.560> few

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.550 
some way to incorporate it into a few
outfit

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.699 

then<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.250> got<00:03:36.580> this<00:03:36.760> tank<00:03:37.180> top<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.590> I'm

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
then I got this tank top and I think I'm

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.490 
then I got this tank top and I think I'm
going<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.069> sort<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.989> modify<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.050> somehow

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
going to sort of modify this somehow

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.559 
going to sort of modify this somehow
because<00:03:41.920> it's<00:03:42.069> just<00:03:42.280> barely<00:03:42.640> long<00:03:43.030> enough<00:03:43.060> for

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
because it's just barely long enough for

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.170 
because it's just barely long enough for
me<00:03:43.720> as<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.610> like<00:03:45.730> really

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
me as it is and then it's like really

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.210

bryant which i believe is like a

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.540 
bryant which i believe is like a
plus-size<00:04:20.500> women<00:04:20.889> store<00:04:21.519> um<00:04:22.139> but<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:24.160> really

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
plus-size women store um but it I really

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
like it it's sort of linen I think yet

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.810 
like it it's sort of linen I think yet
or<00:04:28.780> fifty<00:04:29.500> five<00:04:29.710> percent<00:04:29.740> linen<00:04:30.400> forty<00:04:30.669> five

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
or fifty five percent linen forty five

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.270 
or fifty five percent linen forty five
percent<00:04:30.850> rayon<00:04:31.300> but<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.290> really<00:04:32.620> nice<00:04:32.830> for

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
percent rayon but just really nice for

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.370 
percent rayon but just really nice for
like<00:04:33.460> spring<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.540> summer<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:34.990> I'm<00:04:35.139> just<00:04:35.260> going

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
like spring and summer so I'm just going

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
to take in the waist a lot and um

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.350 
to take in the waist a lot and um
hopefully<00:04:39.070> it'll<00:04:39.580> still<00:04:39.820> fit<00:04:40.000> me<00:04:40.060> but<00:04:40.300> I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
hopefully it'll still fit me but I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.450 
hopefully it'll still fit me but I
really<00:04:40.690> liked<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.080> print<00:04:41.410> it's<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.220> this

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
really liked the print it's like this

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.969 
really liked the print it's like this
pastel<00:04:43.090> green<00:04:43.360> with<00:04:43.810> like<00:04:43.990> green<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.590> bright

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
pastel green with like green and bright

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.130 
pastel green with like green and bright
blue<00:04:45.310> stitching<00:04:48.539> okay<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.720> then<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.960> next

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
blue stitching okay and then the next

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.990 
blue stitching okay and then the next
one<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.620> kind<00:04:50.950> of<00:04:51.010> weird<00:04:51.280> because<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.789> think

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
one is kind of weird because I think

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.900 
one is kind of weird because I think
it's<00:04:52.390> like<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.750> lingerie<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.800> nightgown<00:04:54.190> type

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
it's like a lingerie like nightgown type

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
it's like a lingerie like nightgown type
thing<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.880> was<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> really<00:04:58.210> pretty<00:04:58.630> print

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
thing but it was a really pretty print

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.090 
thing but it was a really pretty print
and<00:04:59.080> it's<00:04:59.200> kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.470> see-through<00:04:59.710> so

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
and it's kind of see-through so

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.440 
and it's kind of see-through so
obviously<00:05:00.550> I'd<00:05:00.700> wear<00:05:00.850> something<00:05:01.180> under<00:05:01.300> it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
obviously I'd wear something under it

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.200 
obviously I'd wear something under it
but<00:05:01.690> i'm<00:05:02.200> just<00:05:02.470> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.740> hemet<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.669> where<00:05:04.090> it
