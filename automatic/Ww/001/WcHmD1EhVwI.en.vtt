00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that it should be I've talked to a lot

that it should be I've talked to a lot
of<00:00:42.899> people<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.440> they've<00:00:43.620> turned<00:00:43.860> around<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of people and they've turned around and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
of people and they've turned around and
told<00:00:44.370> me<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.440> ignore

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
told me that you know just don't ignore

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
told me that you know just don't ignore
it<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.489> car<00:00:47.730> doesn't<00:00:47.969> need<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> pass

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it your car doesn't need to pass

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
it your car doesn't need to pass
emissions<00:00:48.930> anymore<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
emissions anymore you know just it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.250 
emissions anymore you know just it
doesn't<00:00:53.430> mean<00:00:53.670> anything<00:00:54.000> anymore<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
doesn't mean anything anymore well the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380 
doesn't mean anything anymore well the
fact<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> matter<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.820> yes<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
fact of the matter is is that yes it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770 
fact of the matter is is that yes it
does<00:00:58.489> even<00:00:59.489> though<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> could<00:01:00.149> ignore<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
does even though I could ignore the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
does even though I could ignore the
problem<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> catalytic<00:01:01.949> converter<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
problem with the catalytic converter and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
problem with the catalytic converter and
it<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.030> won't<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it really won't make much of a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.440 
it really won't make much of a
difference<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> car<00:01:05.129> runs<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
difference in the way the car runs the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
difference in the way the car runs the
problem<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:08.580> another<00:01:09.360> error<00:01:09.810> occurs<00:01:10.680> with

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
problem is if another error occurs with

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.020 
problem is if another error occurs with
the<00:01:11.130> car<00:01:12.920> there's<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.670> car<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the car there's no way for the car to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.399 
the car there's no way for the car to
indicate<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> new

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
indicate to me that there's a new

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
indicate to me that there's a new
problem<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.490> check<00:01:17.700> engine<00:01:18.030> light<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
problem that check engine light is on it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
problem that check engine light is on it
won't<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.470> suddenly<00:01:19.590> come<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
won't just suddenly come on because it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.570 
won't just suddenly come on because it
is<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.140> need<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> actually<00:01:22.619> correct<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
is on so we need to actually correct the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
is on so we need to actually correct the
problem<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.270> order<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> prevent<00:01:25.470> ourselves

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
problem in order to prevent ourselves

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
problem in order to prevent ourselves
from<00:01:26.390> something<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.420> catastrophic<00:01:27.960> like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
from something really catastrophic like

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.319 
from something really catastrophic like
needing<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.070> engine<00:01:29.369> replacement<00:01:29.790> due<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
needing an engine replacement due to a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.770 
needing an engine replacement due to a
malfunction<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> didn't<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.860> indicated

malfunction that didn't get indicated

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
malfunction that didn't get indicated
the<00:01:33.780> reason<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> we're<00:01:34.619> bringing<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.220> up

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the reason that we're bringing this up

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.660 
the reason that we're bringing this up
is<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.860> currently<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.490> temperature

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is because currently the temperature

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
is because currently the temperature

like<00:01:47.189> gauges<00:01:47.700> over<00:01:48.000> idiot<00:01:48.360> lights<00:01:48.630> because

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like gauges over idiot lights because

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
like gauges over idiot lights because
idiot<00:01:49.320> lights<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.799> come<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.130> until

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the gauge on the cold side but the fact

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.959 
the gauge on the cold side but the fact
is<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.369> reason<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.670> doing

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is it is not the reason that it's doing

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
is it is not the reason that it's doing
this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:03.930> experiencing<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
computer in the car this is a high spot

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.759 
computer in the car this is a high spot
right<00:02:57.450> now<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.690> coolant<00:02:58.170> level<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.560> too<00:02:58.739> low

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
right now the coolant level is too low

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.069 
right now the coolant level is too low
it's<00:02:59.730> not<00:02:59.819> effectively<00:03:00.420> getting<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.930> these

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
it's not effectively getting to these

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.750 
it's not effectively getting to these
sensors<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.709> these<00:03:01.829> sensors<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.340> reading<00:03:02.549> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
sensors so these sensors are reading a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.940 
sensors so these sensors are reading a
lot<00:03:02.940> lower<00:03:03.120> than<00:03:03.239> they<00:03:03.510> should<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.859> that<00:03:04.859> is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
lot lower than they should be that is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
lot lower than they should be that is
going<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.129> knock<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> computers<00:03:05.879> readings

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
going to knock the computers readings

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.770 
going to knock the computers readings
way<00:03:06.959> out<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.290> whack<00:03:07.790> another<00:03:08.790> common<00:03:09.239> area<00:03:09.420> is
