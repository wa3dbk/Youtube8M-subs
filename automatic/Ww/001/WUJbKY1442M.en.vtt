 welcome to the cdh 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.480
 we are no less fast in an interim test than I am sure 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.779
 that this 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.880
 the fire brigade but very much the fire that the fire brigade has sustained 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 only not allowed 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.910
 the interesting option had already been once what will you do other than the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.730
 last time 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.340

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.180
 preud'homme a problem what i see for you is that your safety 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.850
 and so keep track of the flow is nice and smooth with the traffic square and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 ultimately i just want to see you perform independently 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 can become 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 fortunately standing in aadorp we have left a number of standards behind me 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 and then the time has come 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.679

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.390

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 the first half year 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.330
 little attention 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.920

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.909
 cyclists are very vulnerable 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.329
 you never know what they do 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.419

 hard and well resolved 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.149

 every candidate is unique 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.489
 as an examiner, it provides customization a mistake 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.410
 and that can happen to anyone 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.709
