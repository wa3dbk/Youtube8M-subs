 game minecraft had installed about 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.590

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 I downloaded it and installed it we did not need 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.299

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.929
 He did what always happened but then 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.569

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.689
 I did not find anything wait and so 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.270
 I started going into some caves that 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.039
 I was watching everything was normal until 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.560
 I heard a noise that looked like a 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.109
 laughing ghost I got scared but I thought 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.359
 that was my imagination continue pick 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.429
 filling until after chopping so 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.220
 much the wall I found another cave that 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.840
 it seemed a very long corridor the hall 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.719
 It was so long that I could not see the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.610
 end of it went into the hall and 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.009
 I put some torches but what I saw 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.989
 end scared me a lot in the part that 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.030
 I still had not put torches looked 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:55.489
 a twisted and tall silhouette with eyes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.379
 that shone, I froze with fear and 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.989
 the eyes were closing in on me 

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:02.689
 character then I heard the laughter 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.909
 maleficent and she said my name then 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.759

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.150
