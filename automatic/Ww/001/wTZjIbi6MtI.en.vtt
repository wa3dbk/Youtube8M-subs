00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.200
 so in this video we'll talk about 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:17.870
 plugins for anril engine 4 what is 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:21.279
 In general, the plugin for the editor is possible. 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:25.369
 say addition or customization for 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:29.080
 the moisture editor on is in the menu 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.650
 window plug-ins and here we are setting up 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.380
 plugins that are installed for 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.450
 our project is for our project 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.180
 they are for the editor ie these parameters 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.039
 saved exactly in your project here 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.420
 we will find better plugins by default 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.949
 which ones are here at the moment 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.109
 are the most useful part of the plugins 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.809
 here by default you are already included 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.040
 can turn it yourself 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 respectively here tick and 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.450
 restart on but let's say plugins 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.320
 expressions are mathematical expressions 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:27.760
 for blueprint objects let's see 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:29.390
 what is this plugin garden 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.260
 after 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.810
 restarted 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.720
 you have a tick here 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.050
 enable 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.870
 to them of expressing we have added to our 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.840
 blueprint editor and here it is 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.130
 expression of this expression own 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:58.530
 have this dress 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:02:00.460
 is actually a translator so 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.060
 bathe 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.979
 and fact is actually a translator 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:16.270
 math expression i mean you 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:20.739
 enter the number it generates returned 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 value and you can click twice and 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:29.069
 see how to move the express it works 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.310
 that is, it actually breaks your 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.190
 mathematical expression on a blocks of 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.310
 which you will do it in the usual 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.400
 Blueprint is a very useful thing for 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.080
 order to reduce any calculations 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.230
 in the same blueprint 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.500
 to make it clearer you wrote 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.100
 expression he returns it to you if that 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.860
 it is not clear you go inside look 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.870
 how this is calculated is an example 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.150
 the simplest plugin that can 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.209
 turn on 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.200
 then here and plugins for android for 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:19.130
 iphone and for absolutely for anything 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:26.520
 here you can make plugin plugin 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.790
 and before the play-art oud 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.129
 t 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.859
 proper plugin so that you can 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:41.140
 manage the installed plugins 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:44.500
 and a whole bunch of these are the power of these plugins 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.950
 in what we can create again 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.019
 some kind of plugin useful and enable it 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 In the project the same sets most likely 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:01.829
 it will be possible to add some useful 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:05.819
 functions and so on that is 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:09.879
 expand the functionality of our editor 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.879
 not only unreal engine 4 but also 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:18.989
 blueprint editor and so on all 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.989
 anything and everything
