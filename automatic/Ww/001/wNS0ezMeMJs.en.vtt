to<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.130> four<00:00:29.340> star<00:00:29.640> offers<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to actually get these four star offers I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
to actually get these four star offers I
mean<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> four<00:00:31.260> star<00:00:31.500> character<00:00:31.740> cyst<00:00:32.070> from

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
mean the four star character cyst from

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.110 
mean the four star character cyst from
these<00:00:32.700> crystals<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:34.079> proved<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.340> my

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
these crystals I actually proved in my

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020 
these crystals I actually proved in my
theory<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.750> um<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> watch<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> not

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
theory that um if you watch back and not

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170 
theory that um if you watch back and not
the<00:00:39.120> last<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> last<00:00:41.610> post<00:00:41.969> or

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the last is actually the last post or

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
the last is actually the last post or
hunting<00:00:42.420> video<00:00:42.660> obviously<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.170> last<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.860> we

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
hunting video obviously the last one we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.290 
hunting video obviously the last one we
done<00:00:44.100> went<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> support<00:00:44.610> our<00:00:44.789> crystal<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.239> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
done went to support our crystal way if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
done went to support our crystal way if
you<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.690> before<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.649> four

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you go to one before that was a four

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
you go to one before that was a four
star<00:00:47.280> hunting<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.539> proved<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
star hunting video and I proved that you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
star hunting video and I proved that you
have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.340> literally<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.000> freestar

have to literally you see them freestar

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
have to literally you see them freestar
crystals<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.530> once<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.890> 400<00:00:53.340> units<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.969> have

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
crystals at once or 400 units you have

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
crystals at once or 400 units you have
to<00:00:54.360> buy<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> four<00:00:55.920> star<00:00:56.280> crystal<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to buy them for the four star crystal to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
to buy them for the four star crystal to
come<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.289> reason

true so let's go here let's open up this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.510 
true so let's go here let's open up this
next<00:01:30.500> four<00:01:31.500> star<00:01:31.799> crystal<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> watched

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
next four star crystal if you watched

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.539 
next four star crystal if you watched
the<00:01:32.759> last<00:01:33.600> four<00:01:34.049> star<00:01:34.350> crystal<00:01:34.740> opening<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the last four star crystal opening you

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
the last four star crystal opening you
know<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.000> winter<00:01:36.360> soldier<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> we

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
know we got winter soldier and we

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.530 
know we got winter soldier and we

actually we actually took him all the
way<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> max<00:01:40.140> level<00:01:40.290> 10<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
way to the max level 10 so you got to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
way to the max level 10 so you got to
saw<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
saw at when we go in and then you got to
see<00:01:44.220> stats<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.759> level<00:01:44.820> 10<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:45.659> which<00:01:45.899> is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
see stats at level 10 as well which is
