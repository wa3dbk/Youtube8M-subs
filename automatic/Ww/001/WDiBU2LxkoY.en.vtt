 advanced points on the second the fc metz 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.779
 solution where he found with that side that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 will be able to focus this balloon 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.020
 who goes to thank you yes we did not go 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 very far from the pro 's first goal all 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.270
 on time 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.219
 what and yes it's the Reims 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 laurent who will go fix her 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 opponent djellilahine he goes without 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.309
 tripod as its voltage 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 yes the nice recovery it was interesting 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 of boba and traoré it's nice it's 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 kind of atmosphere we like to see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 national standards with this good balloon of 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 diarra that will enter the surface of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.070
 repair 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.780
 he may have to center to multi 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 but it's a good international 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 maybe the good hit released is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 finally stopped from yann's strong point 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.879
 kerboriou good typing of michael la 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350
 granny who obviously looks at a balloon 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.850
 a balloon that comes in front of him full 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 difficult hard-to-hand speed to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.040
 maneuver 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.540
 I am waiting to see what we propose 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 35 years old I'm waiting for that when we propose 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 a few more days but if you 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 propose a small year in addition j rep 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 oh no it would be a shame to stop 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.439
 on a rise jack to dull after taxes 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 or not the gays she is dedicated who has 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.409
 said I still look quite 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 welcome thinking that will pull 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.830
 more also later lescure 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 smart 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.350
 attention with this new action 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 pedro olivera who was gone umma 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 rhodia but who will arm the canche 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.650
 roll a lot of points that Jeremy 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.900
 sopalski out of the game he delays greenhouse 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 which lets the opposing team cool down 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 a little bit so is this a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.790
 superstition what is it psychological 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.189
 attention and maybe because all but 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.180
 operating on video but the opening of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.240
 Libyan pedro score 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.800
 and the us créitil lusitanos frolics 2013 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.580
 begins as 2012 is in front 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.610
 it's half time we'll get it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.330
 included on the side of the stadium charléty 1 goal 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 at 0 for the us créteil lusitanos the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.840
 internship allows each other to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.400
 get closer and get to know each other better 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.860
 it's when we count when we 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.990
 know well we speak better and that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.620
 makes all the difference with Corsican 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.200
 we say thank you that appeared I thought they 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.550
 were going to rely on dira he preferred 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.640
 try it all alone and it's come 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.510
 lick yann's left pole 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.250
 kerboriou djellilahine for the corner that 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.630
 going to be outgoing on the head of nissan 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 in the goal incredible goal is from 0 2 to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.540
 0 for the us créteil lusitanos which has 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.130
 probably paid the match and it's not 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.840
 dany santa cruz who scored his property 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.700
 ibrahima seck it is precisely we have 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.260
 envy not quickly take aim 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 wait for that maybe with the reaction this 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 side parties shock with kerboriou 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.370
 I hope that both players did not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.870
 not hurt but the ouch is maybe a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.920
 blow to play 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.830
 jean michel lesage who will look for a 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.900
 ultimate dry solution 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.430
 yes beautiful intervention it's not finished 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 jean michel lesage again the blow of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.440
 left paw where it was against a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.200
 third goal to crouch dwell jean 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.540
 Michel Lesage panoz the two emissions 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.510
 face who will never die at 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.060
 big ever and jean michel lesage who 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.319
 adjusts with a little bit of success 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.560
 the Parisian defense 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.730
 on the war that returns the 22 actors 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 in the locker room also at home 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.359
 since the paris fc just lost 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.170
 three goal to 0 on his pitch facing the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.620
 leader us créteil lusitanos they have 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.640
 been insolent of success we would have 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.590
 certainly deserved to return to the score 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.080
 the turning point of the match is at the beginning of 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 second half now time to 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.480
 to put 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.370
 even more at work because I 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.840
 think that Amat still has to make 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.189
 results there is a good group and I 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.689
 think it's actually this Thursday 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.939
 from the beginning it's not a pipe 1 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.400
 I think I painted now 22 24 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.170
 holder so here's everyone 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.790
 everyone fits into the frame in 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.469
 the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.030
 in the mold everyone is having fun and 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.989
 then today, all the better, we have a little 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.849
 of serenity because we have a little bit of 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.000
 grade with us so it's still 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.000
 easier
