so<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:20.930> an<00:02:21.080> item<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.860> pick<00:02:22.040> them

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
so it's just an item you just pick them

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.110 
so it's just an item you just pick them
up<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.269> can<00:02:23.599> buy<00:02:23.750> them<00:02:23.959> if<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:24.440> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
up or you can buy them if you're a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.890 
up or you can buy them if you're a
weirdo<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:29.510> right

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
weirdo but all right

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.440 
weirdo but all right
so<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:30.410> sort<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.310> make<00:02:31.459> sense<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.269> if<00:02:32.360> I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so that's sort of make sense so if I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.750 
so that's sort of make sense so if I
just<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> green<00:02:33.410> jersey<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.920> grab<00:02:34.400> them<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
just see a green jersey I grab them and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.949 
just see a green jersey I grab them and
then<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.120> use<00:02:35.209> them<00:02:35.330> as<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> resurrection

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
then you can use them as a resurrection

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.770 
then you can use them as a resurrection
wing<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.730> kind<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.030> weird<00:02:38.269> but<00:02:38.600> all<00:02:38.840> right
