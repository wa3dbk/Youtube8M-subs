petrifies up plating which i think is

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.210 
petrifies up plating which i think is
correct<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:11.140> i<00:04:11.260> still<00:04:11.470> connect<00:04:11.769> four<00:04:11.950> seven

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

there's a concession I guess this video

there's a concession I guess this video
didn't<00:04:18.039> really<00:04:18.250> showcase<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.880> potentially

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
didn't really showcase the potentially

didn't really showcase the potentially
explosive<00:04:19.780> speed<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.440> affinity<00:04:20.709> but<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.549> can

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
explosive speed of affinity but you can

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.190 
explosive speed of affinity but you can
see<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:21.850> was<00:04:22.060> stuck<00:04:22.240> with<00:04:22.419> my<00:04:22.539> red<00:04:22.750> cards<00:04:23.080> in

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
see I was stuck with my red cards in

hand at the end of the game I'm sure you

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.640 
hand at the end of the game I'm sure you
can<00:04:25.180> still<00:04:25.389> see<00:04:25.600> how<00:04:25.750> much<00:04:25.900> damage<00:04:26.110> cranial

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
can still see how much damage cranial

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.350 
can still see how much damage cranial
plating<00:04:26.950> does<00:04:27.130> for<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> small<00:04:27.760> amount<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.120> mana

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
plating does for a small amount of mana

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.210 
plating does for a small amount of mana
and<00:04:28.630> how<00:04:29.020> cheap<00:04:29.289> cards<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.740> thought<00:04:29.950> cast

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and how cheap cards like thought cast

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.960 
and how cheap cards like thought cast

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
strategy of all time but it does have

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.779 
strategy of all time but it does have
some<00:04:38.169> liability<00:04:38.380> side<00:04:38.979> boarded<00:04:39.430> which<00:04:39.580> we
