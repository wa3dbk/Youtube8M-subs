you who don't know about it you're about

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.370 
you who don't know about it you're about
to<00:00:33.079> make<00:00:33.290> some<00:00:33.980> gold<00:00:34.510> now<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:35.989> method<00:00:36.350> has

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
to make some gold now this method has

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.950 
to make some gold now this method has
been<00:00:36.649> out<00:00:36.800> since<00:00:36.829> since<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.820> 4.3<00:00:38.450> patch<00:00:38.660> hit

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
been out since since the 4.3 patch hit

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.080 
been out since since the 4.3 patch hit
and<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.770> might<00:00:39.920> be<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> little<00:00:40.250> saturated<00:00:40.969> but

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
and it might be a little saturated but

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.450 
and it might be a little saturated but
there's<00:00:41.300> still<00:00:41.450> gold<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.200> be<00:00:42.320> made<00:00:42.590> all<00:00:43.160> it

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
there's still gold to be made all it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.170 
there's still gold to be made all it
requires<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:45.559> or<00:00:46.160> someone<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:46.670> know<00:00:46.790> to

usually on the weekends you'll see
emails<00:00:56.180> from<00:00:56.300> crystals<00:00:56.750> dipping<00:00:57.290> down

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
emails from crystals dipping down

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.900 
emails from crystals dipping down
because<00:00:57.920> that's<00:00:58.130> when<00:00:58.340> every<00:00:58.579> one<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.820> their

on the auction house so all you want to
do<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.369> just<00:01:04.640> by<00:01:05.000> mels<00:01:05.329> from<00:01:05.540> crystals<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
do is just by mels from crystals and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.800 
do is just by mels from crystals and
shatter<00:01:06.710> them<00:01:06.979> all<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:08.030> have<00:01:08.149> to<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.600> make

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
shatter them all you have to do is make

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.420 
shatter them all you have to do is make
sure<00:01:08.840> they're<00:01:09.140> cheaper<00:01:09.560> than<00:01:09.890> two<00:01:10.130> heavenly

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
sure they're cheaper than two heavenly

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.109 
sure they're cheaper than two heavenly
shards<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:12.140> golden<00:01:12.320> okay<00:01:13.130> well<00:01:13.880> that

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
shards and you're golden okay well that

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.090 
shards and you're golden okay well that
is<00:01:14.240> you'll<00:01:14.390> make<00:01:14.600> gold<00:01:14.869> now<00:01:15.619> let<00:01:15.770> me<00:01:15.799> tell<00:01:16.009> you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
is you'll make gold now let me tell you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.340 
is you'll make gold now let me tell you
a<00:01:16.130> little<00:01:16.220> bit<00:01:16.340> about<00:01:16.790> Malstrom<00:01:17.659> shatter<00:01:18.049> what

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
a little bit about Malstrom shatter what

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.219 
a little bit about Malstrom shatter what
Nelson<00:01:18.680> chatter<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.929> crushing<00:01:20.929> Malstrom

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
Nelson chatter is crushing Malstrom

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.730 
Nelson chatter is crushing Malstrom
crystals<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.549> I<00:01:22.999> have<00:01:23.479> 18<00:01:23.719> crystals<00:01:24.319> in<00:01:24.409> my<00:01:24.530> bag

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
crystals so I have 18 crystals in my bag

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.090 
crystals so I have 18 crystals in my bag
so<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.429> do<00:01:25.670> 18<00:01:26.240> Maelstrom<00:01:26.869> shatters<00:01:27.350> which

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
so I can do 18 Maelstrom shatters which

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.639 
so I can do 18 Maelstrom shatters which
will<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.399> leave<00:01:28.729> me<00:01:28.759> double<00:01:29.689> that<00:01:29.840> what's<00:01:30.170> 18

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
will then leave me double that what's 18

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.010 
will then leave me double that what's 18
times<00:01:30.979> two<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.520> don't<00:01:31.819> know<00:01:31.999> I'm<00:01:32.569> not<00:01:32.630> good<00:01:32.990> at

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
times two I don't know I'm not good at

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.440 
times two I don't know I'm not good at
math<00:01:33.139> but<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.159> get<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.579> many<00:01:34.880> Maelstrom

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
math but you get that many Maelstrom

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.739 
math but you get that many Maelstrom
crystals<00:01:35.959> so<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:36.920> about<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.389> think<00:01:38.389> about

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
crystals so think about it think about

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.849 
crystals so think about it think about
it<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.039> coming<00:01:40.429> to<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.659> yeah<00:01:41.859> chi-ching

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
it is it coming to you yeah chi-ching

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.269 
it is it coming to you yeah chi-ching
gold<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:44.270> be<00:01:44.420> made<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.740> there<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.069> it

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
gold to be made so there you have it

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.469 
gold to be made so there you have it
another<00:01:46.850> method<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.779> make<00:01:47.959> gold<00:01:49.240> create<00:01:50.240> those

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
another method to make gold create those

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.359 
another method to make gold create those
heavenly<00:01:50.749> shards<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:51.499> mel's<00:01:51.740> from<00:01:51.920> crystals

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
heavenly shards with mel's from crystals

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.370 
heavenly shards with mel's from crystals
just<00:01:53.090> keep<00:01:53.359> checking<00:01:53.779> on<00:01:53.899> those<00:01:54.049> miles<00:01:54.259> from

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
just keep checking on those miles from

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.349 
just keep checking on those miles from
crystals<00:01:54.740> making<00:01:55.039> sure<00:01:55.249> that<00:01:55.880> they're<00:01:56.060> below

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
crystals making sure that they're below

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.589 
crystals making sure that they're below
the<00:01:56.509> market<00:01:56.779> value<00:01:57.139> in<00:01:57.409> order<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.039> place<00:01:58.279> those

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
the market value in order to place those

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.849 
the market value in order to place those
heavenly<00:01:59.599> shards<00:02:00.079> up<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.469> to<00:02:00.679> make<00:02:00.799> a

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
heavenly shards up there to make a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.429 
heavenly shards up there to make a
profit<00:02:01.299> back<00:02:02.299> when<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.569> first<00:02:02.749> came<00:02:02.990> out<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
profit back when this first came out and

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.730 
profit back when this first came out and
I<00:02:03.799> saw<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.039> I<00:02:04.520> was<00:02:04.880> making<00:02:05.060> probably<00:02:06.020> 50<00:02:06.380> 60

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
I saw that I was making probably 50 60

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.809 
I saw that I was making probably 50 60
