engine the capabilities of our of our

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
engine the capabilities of our of our
normal<00:00:54.840> fine<00:00:55.020> antigen<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.920> different<00:00:56.760> ways

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
normal fine antigen in different ways

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
normal fine antigen in different ways
such<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.230> create<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> variety<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
such that we could create a variety of

such that we could create a variety of
mission<00:01:00.180> throughout<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> town<00:01:01.350> shower<00:01:01.680> we

test your strike and then we also have a
new<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.010> called<00:01:08.280> test<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.610> luck

new one now called test your luck
initially<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.860> idea

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
initially it was just this this idea

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
initially it was just this this idea
where<00:01:11.820> you'd<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.720> these<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.470> slap

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
where you'd have these these like slap

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
where you'd have these these like slap
wheels<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.049> come<00:01:16.290> up

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
wheels that would as they would come up

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
wheels that would as they would come up
they<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:16.860> randomly<00:01:17.130> pick<00:01:17.759> different

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
they would randomly pick different

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
they would randomly pick different
modifiers<00:01:19.140> who<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.860> would<00:01:20.009> fight<00:01:20.430> who<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
modifiers who you would fight who you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990 
modifiers who you would fight who you
would<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.920> these<00:01:22.920> modifiers<00:01:23.520> were<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
would be and these modifiers were just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
would be and these modifiers were just
exposed<00:01:24.509> elements<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> flip<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
exposed elements like you flip the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.749 
exposed elements like you flip the
screen<00:01:26.369> upside<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:27.320> double<00:01:28.320> damage<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
screen upside down double damage and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.609 
screen upside down double damage and
what<00:01:29.970> happened<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.990> implemented

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
what happened is when we implemented

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
what happened is when we implemented
this<00:01:31.770> people<00:01:32.280> were<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.670> excited<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this people were so excited about it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
this people were so excited about it
that<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.250> ended<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.640> spawning

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that it actually it ended up spawning

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
that it actually it ended up spawning
off<00:01:36.360> its<00:01:36.600> own<00:01:36.720> separate<00:01:37.619> mode<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> game

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
off its own separate mode in the game

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
off its own separate mode in the game
sometimes<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> was<00:01:39.509> fun<00:01:39.720> stuff<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.740> some
