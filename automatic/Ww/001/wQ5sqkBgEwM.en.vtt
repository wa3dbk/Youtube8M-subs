00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.020
 greetings my friends from 'skyscraper' city 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.900
 this is a video tutorial that I created 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.230
 for new people that always 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.470
 they have difficulty placing a photo 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 in the forum 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 Here we will give you the steps to do it 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.370
 correctly 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.129
 ok the first thing we will do is locate 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.860
 the thread where we want to post our 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.370
 image in this case I went to the thread of 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:50.079
 the instagram photo sessions 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.079
 let's go to the end of the thread 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 because then here we say it says post 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 replay or post 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.290
 here where is that yellow icon there 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.180
 is the icon where we give it so that it does not 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.710
 leave our little window to place the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.800
 link 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.010
 okay 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.470
 but first let's go to the page 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 where we hosted image or be 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 where we have located 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.370
 we can do it by copying from the bar 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.860
 address we can copy the link from 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.470
 there or just give you a right click 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.480
 we give to copy 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480
 url of the image 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.290
 in case we have the mozilla click 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 right and copy the path of the image 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.610
 because now yes 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310
 we copy 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.340
 we go then 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.740
 Where we are going to post we click 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.110
 the window does not come out 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.930
 we stick 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.660
 the link that we have already copied 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.010
 to accept 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.900
 finally we give you to send answers 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.439
 and there is our image 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.860

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.470

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.970
