00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.649
 the international positive college finishes 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.719
 to be inaugurated in curitiba 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.269
 the project signed by the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 architect 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.490
 sustainability 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.490
 Let's check 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.470
 from 2013 the positive group counts 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.140
 with a new headquarters in ecoville 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.840
 the international positive college is a 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.390
 innovative proposal and a school of 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.530
 extended period where children 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.339
 up to high school and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.620
 can obtain 27 two 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:51.250
 certification and certification 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:55.449
 school and our school can 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.210
 count on this record of goes to blame 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.850
 to collaborate so that this learning is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.519
 be much more efficient so that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.950
 children to have an environment of well-being 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.189
 harmonious harmony so that they 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.810
 learn is within possibilities that 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:17.290
 the architecture is evidence is in the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.600
 day to day in pedagogical activities 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.119
 this zeal and this care with the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 sustainability with awareness 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.960
 ecological way of doing it in a simple way 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.899
 more intelligible and creative in the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.719
 use of production materials 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.119
 we have a very special zeal to 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:42.270
 that we can expand the children 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 attitudes of environmental conscience 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.649
 What makes a school a school? 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 sustainable green school is easy 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.840
 remember we usually work 555 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.289
 area five themes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.899
 obviously energy efficiency 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.149
 efficiency in water selection of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.950
 materials are looking for materials that 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.330
 have a minor impact on the environment and 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.489
 material that aaa has a lower 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.560
 with regard to the issue of 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.989
 pollutants into the internal environment 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.620
 the quality of the internal environment is one 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.870
 the items that also addresses the issue of 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.900
 natural lighting and natural ventilation 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.530
 acoustical comfort and finally we 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.780
 we ended up working innovation every 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.519
 classrooms are facing north 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.579
 that curitiba is important due to the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.579
 Our winter but to curse me 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.040
 impact of the summer sun the whole façade is 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.440
 protected by a system of brises and the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.989
 videos that were used are glasses 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.730
 We are low of the initial dide 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.280
 glasses with thermal properties 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.930
 that let the light in 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.230
 do not let a heat come in 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.970
 the combination of these two factors 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.950
 made it possible to take advantage 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.250
 natural light without compromising the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.750
 thermal comfort and this is translated by 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.660
 positive group in an economy of 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.349
 approximately 40 thousand reais per year 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.540
 this is money you can reverse 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.760
 in more activities with the students better 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.560
 quality of education and so on 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.329
 then it makes all the sense the world is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.919
 investing in energy efficiency in 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.109
 comfort mainly in the context of 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.329
 school you release resources to 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.950
 invest in the child, we talked about the 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.569
 properties of glass but it does not 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.130
 it is also a laminated glass 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.370
 This means that when you close the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.400
 window or close the door to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.530
 noises is huge is a glass also has 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.780
 fantastic acoustic properties 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.310
 all classrooms have been installed 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.019
 acoustic panels 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.180
 we are in an environment here that the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.730
 library that is an environment with one foot 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.760
 high right which makes the air 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.739
 also provides comfort 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.829
 for those who are reading working here in 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.829
 library 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.880
 many of the innovative things that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.190
 were implemented here was because 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.080
 there was a change of thought to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.080
 change of approach I think this is 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.830
 the main factor of greatest impact in 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.810
 to make it possible to develop a 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.090
 sustainable project is a school one 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.489
 house one with a building offices of one 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.489
 smart and workable way 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.180
