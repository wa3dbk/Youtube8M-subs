 and here the list of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.550
 functions that we can do the first 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.950
 is to see the screen of the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.570
 of the pc of our cell phone the second 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.520
 our pc 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.040
 the third the truth I do not know I'm not going to 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.360
 lie this to see the files that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.880
 he has a computer 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 This is the joystick for games 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.300
 careers 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.700
 This is a gamepad that hides 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.560
 little machines 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.630
 text 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.380
 works for babies works well not 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.380
 there is no problem 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 let's see the topics functions 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.280
 the joystick for inter games 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.450
 how to see caste for recharged 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.170
 and shoot and those things but they are enough to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 the other appointments 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.750
 good keep watching 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.750
 for flight simulation games 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.959
 is this the truth I am in the desire not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.959
 I know how to play those games 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.909
 I do not know what it is for 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.909
 logically let's see 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.170
 you make the keyboard that comes in another 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.540
 difficult language is here we can 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.840
 use as a keyboard as I explain the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.739
 firm selected a program a folder 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.739
 what we did player 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.540
 when the number bread that is also 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.610
 but by numbers keyboard 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.610
 it works because it does not have the keyboard 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.140
 of foreigners but transfer the text 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.180
 from the cell phone to the computer but that's not 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.040
 I think that it occupies 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.560
 power to find them to use the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.310
 powerpoint with cellular the touchpad is 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.310
 to move the mouse 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.230
 with the help of the cell phone as you can see 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.230
 seeing 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.060
 the browser mode is to control the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.250
 internet from the cell phone and media mode 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.780
 to control the audio tracks that 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.430
 are you listening to a computer 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.990
 by cell phone 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.490
 and well that has been all easy easy to 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.820
 use you do not have to adjust anything all 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.820
 it's okay 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.480
 soon I will be uploading more videos I hope 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.740
 that has served them 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.740
 goodbye and until next time
