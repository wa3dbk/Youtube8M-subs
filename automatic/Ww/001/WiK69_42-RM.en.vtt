00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.669
 When you're just thinking about being the 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.190
 end without strength to believe and fight 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.750
 behind your goals when you feel 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.120
 defeated no one else believed in 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.010
 You and not even you believe in your 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.560
 own dreams when strength is lacking 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.749
 when there is no hope when all 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.730
 turn their backs and the masks fall 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.570
 When you realize that no one is 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.480
 your return 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.150
 feeling worthless forgetting a weak 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.489
 then stand up and look in the mirror and I said 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.290
 for yourself you can why the 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.090
 others say what they say not 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.609
 matter what matters what you 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.460
 really is what you're going to do in relation to 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.370
 Only you can change your situation. 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 life your image your spirit at will 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.809
 comes from inside does not come from outside 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.429
 do not just have to do not enough 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.500
 try have to persist 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.170
 You can not stop, you can not give up. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.750
 even if everyone has taken their backs 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.179
 You're the only reason you're joking. 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.940
 can change that only you can do the 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.610
 world is silent what defines you is yours 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.159
 attitude then have attitude and make 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560
 worthy of respect 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:17.030
 you respect yourself and raise the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 And I'm going to fight. 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.049
 to think it was all over 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.880
 but I realized that I was much stronger 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.860
 that everything that I let reach me 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.409
 has the back up and now I know the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.659
 how strong am I and only have one advice 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.180
 for you to be stronger than 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 because we are surrounded by people. 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 weak constantly complaining about life 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.820
 when everything seemed lost 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.759
 my anger gave me a sense of inheritance 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.859
 nervous to the point of bursting , 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.829
 training won off 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.840
 I went into the gym with my head down. 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.409
 I wanted to train part of taking my money. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 rage 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.179
 all in an instant it was me 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.090
 calming the noise of the friends and I 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.819
 reassuring peron laugh every day 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.429
 was sacred and for the academy to focus on 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.979
 Another heavy training session was 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.049
 body result of a job 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.540
 carved by a face dedicated to the mind 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.160
 it was flowing everything was improving 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 new friends that I was not even 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.660
 waiting the time passed and I 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.209
 I could distinguish friends from 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.790
 true facts so that befit 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.739
 lifted weight plays bar up but the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
 corner on each side only to break the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.120
 Many fibers with my story I 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.980
 I know if I identify others with friends 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.739
 that are off the list at 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 I become a gym turning mutants 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.410
 that I do not see myself spending time finding this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.660
 impressive can call artificial 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.380
 but can not stop your mine that gives me 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.359
 moral 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.150
 I'd rather talk about myself than I'm getting. 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.700
 strangers should be because they double tone the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.739
 their size to muscles that only increase the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.920
 weight on the scale showing the difference 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.319
 of men and children came agitated 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.280
 abdominal fushun 20 kilometers from 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.500
 skull of 100 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.650
 in the transverse show trapeze that more
