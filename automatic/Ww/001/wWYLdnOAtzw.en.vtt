00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.440 

look<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.100> Chargers<00:01:05.640> offense<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.180> isn't

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
look the Chargers offense just isn't

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.000 
gonna be as bad as it was last year I
actually<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> may<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.600> impossible

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
actually think that may be impossible

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.050 
actually think that may be impossible
but<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> his<00:01:11.370> full<00:01:11.520> complement<00:01:12.030> of

two years the offensive lines still a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.500 
two years the offensive lines still a

squad by the time the season starts

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.070 
squad by the time the season starts
fortunately<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> cost<00:01:48.900> you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
fortunately it's not going to cost you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.540 
fortunately it's not going to cost you
much<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.410> add<00:01:49.500> michael<00:01:49.710> vick<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.160> roster

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
much to add michael vick to your roster

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.790 
much to add michael vick to your roster
and<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.080> lot<00:01:52.259> less<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> do

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
and really this has a lot less to do
