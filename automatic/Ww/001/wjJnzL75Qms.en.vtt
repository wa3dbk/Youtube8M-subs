 I had made the precise comment and it is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.879
 what I do not agree that those 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.409
 they were infiltrating with organizations 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.180
 of bad reputation 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.460

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.140

 theft of gasoline do not feel frustrated 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.180
 practically because as you know 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.769
 I 've always been fighting here 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.500
 I mention that accused 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.750
 banking I believe them charged them 7 thousand 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.659
 pesos per spa a month is a thing 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.820
 totally totally is a lie if 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.259
 You can verify this with the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.120
 administrative procedures of the bañeros de 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.850
 huandacareo that with a no 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.370
 this man who dedicated more than 23 years to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.830
 this institution regardless of schedule or 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.470
 the weather conditions and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.420
 most critical economic regret it 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.280
 the incomprehension of his boss what 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.380
 leads to stop serving citizens 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.410
 we work 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.080
 used to working in a pressure 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.300
 of disasters and then working on 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.770
 some way in another kind of pressure 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.050
 well the staff is not working at 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.330
 100% to provide this support to the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.610
 population despite the fact that Jorge Romero has 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.010
 a broad trajectory through a 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.290

 civil protection manuel rose was limited 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.220
 to say that he submitted his resignation because 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.330
 along with other elements refuses to 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.960
 update you have groups between them 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.850
 are divided and this clearly affects the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.770
 good operation and operability 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 of their emergency service 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.630
 they must be trained then 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.730
 they see 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.460
 do not want to adapt to the new system 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.960

 public safety of the state 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.210
 all kinds of tests to corroborate 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.730
 that he did not commit any irregularity in 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:35.820
