00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.510
 According to a study carried out by the UN, 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.049
 world population will arrive in the year 2050 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.500
 about 9 billion people and in 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.259
 concrete usa is expected to be 25 by 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.649
 percent of its total population is Latin 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.689
 or hispart that means that the fourth 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.599
 part of the total population of the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.899
 United States of America will carry 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.489
 our blood 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.070
 USA is a country made up of 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.990
 immigrants all owe it to people 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.080
 from other countries that have come to populate 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.530
 their lands and enrich them the difficult 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.020
 to believe is that by the year 2050 the sum 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.820
 of all minorities will be almost 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.390
 equivalent to the amount of targets 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.520
 Americans explained the population 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.670
 Asian will grow 213 percent 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.689
 reaching 33 million people 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:10.100
 Hispanic Americans will increase 188 by 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.170
 hundred growing to 102 million and the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.549
 afrodescendants 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.930
 blacks will increase 77 percent arriving 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.820
 to 61 million people in turn 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.479
 the white American population 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 will grow only 7% that is to say they will be 210 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.030
 million the new america will not be 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.939
 mestizo with darker skin hair 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.539

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.679
 thin and with an average height of 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 one meter with eighty-five centimeters 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:56.990
 in men and a meter 65 centimeters in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.690
 women this new reality will be 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.030
 accompanied by unimaginable changes the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.730
 which we present in our sixth and

 last link 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.750
 phishing is already believed what darwin said is the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.760
 evolution of the species the human being 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.970
 at least in the US it will change 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.070
 physically by 2050 but that's not 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.610
 will be the only transformation from which 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.640
 we will be witnesses not the technology advances 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.370
 and nothing stops its passage five scientists 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.140
 they gave their projections of all I see the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.409
 man in the year 2050 and they create are 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.569
 hard to believe 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.700
 according to the magician of George George 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.530
 church molecular engineer of the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.599

 technological massachusetts in states 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.209
 united in 2050 mankind will 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.370
 managed to beat aging 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.280
 we will be young until the day of our 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 death another visionary of the future and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.269
 tech genius steve wozniak 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 thinks that personal computers 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 they will have surpassed human beings and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.079
 They could even compete with our 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.530
 feelings like that is computers 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.290
 will have feelings or at least those 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.079
 will recognize according to the co-founder of the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.299
 manzanita company the best friends 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.250
 It was a computer with her incase you 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.709
 look in the face you will recognize your 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.299
 state of mind will know your soul and your 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.760
 heart better than any other human being 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.920
 in the world 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.050
 chilling do not believe but those are not 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.890
 the only projections for the mythical 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:44.030
 year 2050 facebook will no longer ask you 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.069
 what are you thinking will know we will learn 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.730
 different languages just by installing one 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.060
 application 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.930
 in our brain and to be parents 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.069
 we will have to approve 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.069
 and some exams

 director of mobility of the company 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.769
 technology standard 4 provides that for the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.720
 year 2050 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.650
 the technology will totally control 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.620
 the people in your hypothesis the skin 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.509
 think that we will live connected not 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.269
 you can go anywhere without being 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.490
 know and this will force you to be good 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.880
 citizen will increasingly be handled more 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.880
 data that will serve to predict your life 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.970
 to control people an example 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.100
 simple but hard social networks if 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.310
 social networks will no longer ask you 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.960
 what are you thinking they will know and not only 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:46.169
 that will be published by all of them absolutely 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.169
 all imagine the amount of problems 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.849
 and fighting but in addition to these 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.530
 advances in the technology that surrounds us 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.620
 We must learn any language 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.650
 loading an application that our 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.289
 brain for example or at least that's what 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.020
 what do you think will happen in 2050 Ivan 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.780
 genius 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.120
 evans is the inventor of twiter and ensures 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.479
 that soon the internet will be installed in 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.789
 our heads the explanation is 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.530
 surprising there are experiments that 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.300
 show that computers and 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.360
 our memory can be manipulated 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.669
 by electrochemical reactions of 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.830
 there who think that by 2050 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.050
 develop programs that are installed in 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.069
 the brain and then let us learn 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.400
 new things without any effort or 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.400
 wear 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.710
 within 36 years the technology not only 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.410
 will control our memory and our 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.840
 behavior will also qualify 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.210
 our potential to have children like that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.199
 it is an act as natural and free as the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:53.470
 being a parent in 2050 will be governed 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.240
 by technology and bioethics is the 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.100
 matter that deals with all the problems 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.860
 ethics that have to do with life in 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.770
 general the human the environment and the 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.479
 I treat animals in other words 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.910
 regulates the development and implementation of the 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.710
 technology to life the teacher of 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.630
 emerging technologies and director of 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.080
 institute creative future of Scotland 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.110
 andy maya is known as the guardian 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.990
 of bioethics 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.390
 and predicted that in the year 2050 the parents 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.570
 you will probably see that having a 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.090
 special license to be able to have children 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.920
 his hypothesis is based on what we will be 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.980
 able to perfect the species 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.150
 human and to influence the evolution 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.560
 fatherhood will be something very different 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.750
 There will come a day when there will also be a 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.790
 license to be a parent to know up 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.400
 where are you willing to modify 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.140
 genetic way to your children and keep 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.120
 so a perfect race and the advance of the 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.040
 technology will discount strong debates in 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.070
 the terrain of natural sciences and 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.860
 ethics on the one hand can be done 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.650
 human organs like liver kidneys 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.310
 lungs or corneas for transplants and 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.010
 save lives but on the other is challenged 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.610
 to death fabricated human beings 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.270
 almost indestructible and with a destiny 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.030
 practically written 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.810
 this is the future that awaits us for the 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.560
 year 2050 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.460
 to those areas 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.479
 a future 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.479
 hard to believe
