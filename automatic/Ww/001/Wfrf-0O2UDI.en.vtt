5,000 number one it was a little
off-balance<00:01:34.369> you've<00:01:34.970> got<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.270> huge<00:01:35.450> spring

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
off-balance you've got this huge spring

off-balance you've got this huge spring
mechanism<00:01:36.050> which<00:01:36.560> was<00:01:36.679> necessary<00:01:37.310> for<00:01:37.550> the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
mechanism which was necessary for the

anybody who shot of pistols knows that
this<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.799> really<00:01:46.040> not<00:01:46.159> very<00:01:46.400> ergonomic<00:01:47.119> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
this is really not very ergonomic and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.359 
this is really not very ergonomic and
number<00:01:48.080> three<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.380> was<00:01:48.500> very<00:01:48.740> expensive<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
number three it was very expensive to

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.030 
number three it was very expensive to
make<00:01:49.520> was<00:01:50.030> sort<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.270> like<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.600> Luger

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
make was sort of like the Luger

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.170 
make was sort of like the Luger
incidentally<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.159> Luger<00:01:52.340> came<00:01:52.700> just<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.970> few

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
incidentally the Luger came just a few

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.010 
incidentally the Luger came just a few
years<00:01:53.270> after<00:01:53.390> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
years after this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.359 
years after this
Luger<00:01:54.439> worked<00:01:54.740> with<00:01:54.920> Borchardt<00:01:57.159> looks<00:01:58.159> very

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
Luger worked with Borchardt looks very

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.080 
Luger worked with Borchardt looks very
much<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.549> a<00:01:58.729> Luger<00:01:59.060> doesn't<00:01:59.360> it

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
much like a Luger doesn't it

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.279 
much like a Luger doesn't it
