00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.180
 [Music] 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 team left the soul the court and that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.890
 they have value but what the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.660
 attention is that all at once I 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.660
 I ask for the arbitration to the government 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.650

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750

 game so we'll be seeing are 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.820
 the last ones just arrived a little bit 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.309
 they are warm our 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.200
 our game we will be a question of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.500
 question about the game rule that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:18.570
 let's talk more let's talk about a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:21.990
 rule three game rules to see if 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.950
 some to mail tvc sports ps tv mx 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.620
 later we will tell you how to take 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.640
 the match 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:36.050
 [Laughs] 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.180
 we hear appeals after the game of 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.190
 america was because he simply lived 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.610
 this or felt an injustice is 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.250
 really justice let's see what 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.140
 occurs in this game the position of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.310
 referee was good extraordinary I think 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.870
 that's right there 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.870
 the woman had some performances today 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:03.619
 of entry of this entry move to 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:05.240
 Pretty red card while trying to 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.260
 get with the studs in front with 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.210
 much 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.310
 the movement of the america is for 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.770
 kick the ball and then comes counting 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.230
 monovalent that I think is there I think 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.300
 that this entry does not remember that it is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.680
 reckless and reckless and we put force 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.530
 which makes you as a use of force 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.060
 for me it is excessive and also with the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.430
 part with which hits novaretti and the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.780
 america player that's a sole 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.430
 of the shoe the wall stays with 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.740
 too much force too much speed and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.010
 for our red card game 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.600
 well there is that play that although 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.270
 principle was very close I think 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.370
 to be left behind is not the expulsion 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.800
 of the players of america 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.580
 we see minute 37 again the scope there 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.580
 that to say it is also hanging flips 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 peñalosa 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.120
 but the position never doubts never ever 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.920
 has everything is thinking about the card 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.150
 red the moment you see the action there is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.800
 what you do not start thinking to direct 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.470
 circumstances enslave the precision 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 of peñalosa is extraordinary and I think 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.330
 that is very different forgiveness and finished this 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.480
 it's very different for me to the one from 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.660
 novaretti 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.880
 there are many to me it seems to me that I did not go 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.280
 referee looks there are many who are 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.140
 overtakes the player of the offensive 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.810
 let's say or the part before and the other 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.760
 simply if I was in an attitude 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.560
 defensive to block and arrive late and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.720
 then the contact is more the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.610
 play or the ball is on the side of the balcony 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.920
 the leg supports the leg in this 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 played in this clear is 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.150
 and you have to say is what we talked about 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.450
 the shape 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.450
 I see him 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.940
 it's so much the way to lift up 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.700
 leg settled as if 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.590
 come down 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.250
 under this point of view watching the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.540
 repetition I think that out there but being 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.540
 a little 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.110
 there is the normal way to live well 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.110
 opening 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.090
 Contact in contact with the ball 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.500
 ends up playing and I also insist on the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.330
 leg and well the leg does not go 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.970
 directly to the ball is to say the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.970
 leg is directed towards the america 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.220
 up the contact with the original value 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.230
 does not go directly to the support leg 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.760
 like jesus molina but if they do not go to 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.320
 you will cover the grandmother as fair is 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.770
 to open the leg whatever it was like that 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.840
 clearly the side and that and that's going to happen 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.249
 always not now 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.639
 the criminal 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:29.189
 in the 67th minute there we see peñalosa 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.189
 about 20 minutes to the area 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:40.659
 the best position assistant is the one 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.279
 Once you have decided there never and 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.249
 then there there yes you have to say look 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.949
 this bad one if you watch assistant his 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:53.139
 assistant only contain you have is 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:58.629
 a penalty play I think later we 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:01.239
 is left when this this for me this of 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.909
 Jaime if it is and direct for example about 

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:07.049
 the central defender within the area is 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.049
 foolish play nazi 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:14.439
 it is a foolishness to aquivaldo 

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:15.579
 both the leg already in the area in a 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.679
 play in which you are mark you 

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:19.719
 non-financial risks you risk to 

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:21.940
 do not play the ball play like in this 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:25.690
 case a good activated we have left 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:33.100
 the opponent's leg and if it is for those 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:36.970
 three strict women to see what I want 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:44.820
 see how much you use them when you 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:44.820
 you add your diet 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.139
 [Music] 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.170
 and I think in general terms in a 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.300
 qualifying match or it is difficult 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.740
 only agrees in that sense by 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.780
 that is that you can give it a little bit more 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.120
 not by the qualification of what 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.480
 regards this party commits me 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.480
 as well 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:23.480
 Repeat, we return with 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.870
 more here total arbitration do not go 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.870
