okay and the boat was partially

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.120 
okay and the boat was partially
submerged<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.869> that<00:00:18.869> said<00:00:19.230> I'll<00:00:19.770> let<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> know

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
submerged so that said I'll let you know

really<00:00:36.530> good<00:00:36.680> shape<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.010> even<00:00:37.700> though<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:37.879> was

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
really good shape so even though it was

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.369

structural damage stuck to the hull of
the<00:00:41.390> boat<00:00:41.960> bus<00:00:42.350> has<00:00:42.620> some<00:00:42.830> cosmetic<00:00:43.370> stress

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610

but<00:00:45.559> overall<00:00:46.370> I'd<00:00:46.640> say<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.910> boats<00:00:47.089> actually

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
