00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.330
 stone and mark weisbrot 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.439

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.530
 by venezuela 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.200
 says the Bush government had a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.200
 express policy of trying to isolate 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.209
 venezuela from its neighbors but instead 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.270
 of that the strategy resulted in the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.150
 isolation of washington the president 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.370
 obama at its first meeting with leaders 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.209

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.590
 very english expression true 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.780
 Maximilian an expression of the new 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.560
 start or leave everything behind and 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.450
 start again from scratch 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.420
 President Obama promised a new 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.200
 start but today your government will 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.050
 finds even more isolated than his 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.520
 predecessor george bush and largely 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 for the same reasons 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.599
 and here oliver stone and mark weisbrot 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.950

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.800
 President Obama 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.330
 unfortunately the same format followed 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.370
 the same scheme of the policy 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.330
 interventionist york bus that has 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.820
 gone isolating progressively says oliver 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.600
 stone and maxwell brought in this article 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.060
 that has circulated in the USA 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.580
 says a clear example of this 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.820
 equipment was the vote not very 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.520
 couple in the oea in relation to 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:59.490
 Venezuela on March 7 29 of 32 countries 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.830
 not only rejected the attempt to 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.560
 Washington to make the oea 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.890
 intervene in venezuela but that 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.960
 also, if it was not enough, they approved one 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.670
 resolution in which they expressed their 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.420
 solidarity with the government of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.000
 mature nicholas president is difficult 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.210
 imagine a more diplomatic defeat 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.770
 rotunda that is in an institution in 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.470
 the one that the American government still 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.560
 it has a high and disproportionate degree 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.410
 of influence do not say it I say so 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.590
 these two Americans very 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.320
