00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello friends little info video and me 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.500
 need your help 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.910
 those who are a bit concerned 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.259
 photoshop know it maybe 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.510
 already noticed my name is now again 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.980
 let's play markus first why is that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.960
 so let's play markus was my first 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.410
 let's play channel i made on 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 may 2010 and september 2011 when i am 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 I was not mistaken because of that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.789
 copyright strikes and because of the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 I am in partnership with mine 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 actual two-channel wm pulled and there 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 I am since then the thing is I think 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 the name net per markus still 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.899
 matching the easy on point 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.360
 here's where s place must be why markus 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.219
 busanni npm down that's all one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 a bit awkward but how much 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.100
 some see this as a hurdle 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.899
 Anyway, my name is google plus 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.670
 again ex play markus and have so synonymous 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 furnished that if you go to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 example www youtube com / zens per 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.910
 markus does not enter that one on mine 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.480
 old channel on the dead lands but 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.949
 here on my current channel in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 I am both you can eat me 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.480
 continue to call susanne or neo like 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 however, my name is now again 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 officially network markus you can 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.040
 thumbs really show if that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 good or bad, yes , that would be 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.909
 bad will be ego sun lpm 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 he found it better to thumb down 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.840
 give it to you here at this video 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.820
 Just a wanner 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.229
 ballaballa I still have it like this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360
 a nice banner therefore stands now 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 also neo his strengths 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 there is now also let's play markus 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.300
 and not neo his parents and that anymore 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 whole still with the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.650
 old figures and and and the ball became 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.510
 made by the clp because you have the synonymous 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.610
 whole last banner and backgrounds 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.270
 made old design that was all 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 epic but introduce again now 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.300
 annoyance from because we make something new 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 I thought I have so 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.830
 many say for example, on lpm 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.080
 fans yes the channel then they think so 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.540
 eps and that's why we do that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.720
 again as before what I like how much 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 years you send me your banner 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:06.150
 So what am I on my last markus 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.980
 channel should do it on me now 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.280
 think it's important that on the one hand 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.620
 big let's play markus on it and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.320
 also relatively small also neo his lp like 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.460
 That said, I'm still some 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.380
 do not get it too fast 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.970
 and that's probably how it will be 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
 months maybe even years to go 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 the last checked serbe has today 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.590
 No one showed that I'm from networks 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.930
 lbm we will not dwell on it 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.610
 that does not mean everyone should 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.489
 now with names in this competition 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.770
 in this cadre creation 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.920
 that means you have to deal with photoshop 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.450
 i do not know it myself though 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.340
 hobby, what you do or do 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 create your own design cool 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.000
 then hit the buttons or yours 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.209
 mouse clicks however and whatever I do 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.190
 just not now so ask me what 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.680
 for a measure had this banner and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.700
 how do we do that best you should 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.470
 you already know it 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.250
 why I do it not I know it does 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.230
 not and you send so if you 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.860
 what to do if you're in the mood for poker 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.870
 you can do it with figures with 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.630
 Artworks that match my let's play 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.910
 this lettering view 3ds retro the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.020
 fits well but otherwise I leave 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.570
 you have the freedom of design 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.330
 you can give me when a banner for 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.460
 I sent him 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.160
 markus bader at gmx.de 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.290
 is still in the video description 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.050
 You send this e mail adress to me 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.200
 your banner suggestions if you're upset 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.360
 of course you will be finished in the end 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 big rwe now your set is maybe 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 the chance of me like me now 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940
 I try to lure but completely im 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.310
 seriously if I then post info video 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.720
 makes to say 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.910
 he created the banner for me 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.550
 and I do not care if it's express 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.250
 or whatever that is then sometimes 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.730
 maybe a bit of attention 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.280
 fahrig was I can you as 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.270
 offering consideration and as I said 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.890
 you have to have it stop bock 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.390
 maybe you have an idea as said 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.360

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.980
