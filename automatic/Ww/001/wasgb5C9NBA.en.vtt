00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.250
 What is the author of the project vitamin. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.189
 Baths and today our guest is Vladimir 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.349
 this is a specialty for proper nutrition 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.890
 he is a nutritionist consultant here 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.500
 already 17 years old I 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.300
 ask a question about old age diets 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.540
 volatile how diets generally affect 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.140
 our health is our body he 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.060
 adapted to a specific diet here 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.540
 and in principle it produces 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.980
 certain juices enzymes here it works 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.580
 in a certain way hormonal 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.640
 system 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:40.579
 and so many people are transitional 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.890
 periods of autumn or spring feel 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.630
 disharmony to your body and very 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.300
 there are often even the aggravation of many 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.000
 People such people very many why this 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.460
 happens because at this moment and 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.109
 there is a change in the power trace of it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:02.899
 in the autumn and then in the winter and winter 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.370
 on spring that's not even the principle 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.590
 weather conditions depend 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.230
 why it happens namely depends 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.000
 from the fact that food changes and 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.710
 each food must be developed 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 certain gastric juice 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.600
 he is different because when we are in summer 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 or is it more in all the facts 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.760
 use and then we 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.549
 there is a transition of power to more such 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.790
 solid food but even carrot cabbage 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.280
 beets and for processing already 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.850
 these as the gradients of the authorities are needed at all 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.170
 other juices and enzymes than those that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.870
 we needed were in the summer and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 so so many people 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.790
 Well, here they are 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.800
 adverse events here and those people 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.610
 who are starting to use some 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.290
 diets and diet is generally very strong 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 different from our food 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 condition and in principle the organism is 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.120
 this moment is under stress 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.000
 sharp such downloading a sharp jump 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.260
 food and he does not have time 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 reorient your endocrine and 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.649
 enzyme system to even 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 recycle what we start 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.720
 use whatever good it is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.170
 Diet here she very quickly changes our 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.030
 food system and the body is not quite 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.550
 properly recycle it firstly 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.670
 secondly it is stressful for the body and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.500
 the third organism lacks those 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.410
 nutrients that he had 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.860
 earlier here because for any 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.120
 the body is very important that there was a process 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.650
 this process he was not changeable and than 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.650
 more quickly changing some 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 process is more for the body and not 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.920
 adapt that's why diets they 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.870
 very harmful whatever they were good 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.670
 here are especially diets that are associated with 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.800
 protein food because on 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.020
 protein processing needs much 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.010
 more and all sorts of enzyme juice and 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.890
 much more energy is needed by man and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.690
 so I do not know about the food on the dummies 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.520
 diet principle it is effective for 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 human diet because the right one 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.560
 man has a lot of stress here 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.709
 he even loses his stress due to stress 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.500
 and calories do not lose and loses consumed 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.530
 more calories and lose and weight 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.750
 naturally more principle she 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.760
 how would pain effectively but after 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 man throws this diet organism 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.550
 having gone through this stress, he wants to return everything 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.190
 back and sometimes even without typing everything 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
 much faster and basically a person still 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.160
 gaining more than what he had 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.040
 before diet 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.440
 besides probably meat diet meat 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.269
 poorly digested before rotting processes 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.650
 but in principle he may not be all people 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.080
 know that earlier in China people whose 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.359
 sentenced them to death penalty 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.910
 they were killed they were just given meat food 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:24.430
 only meat and they will just be consuming 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.060
 the meat was dying for that reason 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.130
 meat processing needs a lot 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.950
 hydrochloric acid and when a person 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.720
 consumes only meat all the time 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.900
 it is produced hydrochloric acid 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.210
 Well, more acidic and gradually 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.930
 man begins to eat himself in Crimea 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.110
 scary when 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.670
 so yes it turns out that man 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.800
 was dying 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.150
 very terrible death pony that's it 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.610
 maybe there are other options like 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.270
 you can lose weight with light 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.689
 well in order to lose weight here is a man 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.349
 should not dramatically change his habits 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.169
 power supply 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.259
 it is very important in this case for 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.449
 man will not be any stress here 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.889
 even if he wears on less quickly 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.979
 how is the diet 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.500
 but it is even more important not to 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.389
 lost fast why because when 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.409
 the human satchel is losing weight by more than 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.919
 4 kilograms 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.469
 he gets stressed out I'm losing weight 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.319
 that is, it is all set aside 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:35.500
 here we have everything formed and after 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:39.909
 how he throws something on his body 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.279
 set your task to replenish that food 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.139
 by and large it is stocks 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.810
 if we have body fat it 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.599
 our stocks for a rainy day and the body 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.090
 specially creates and because axial 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:56.199
 rainy day he will take them from there well 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.360
 when a person quickly loses weight then he has 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.319
 very much stress and after he 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.819
 throws lose weight on a diet he quickly 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.830
 gaining this weight so that not 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.250
 there was a rapid weight gain needed 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.440
 to man the lot slowly in the first place in 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.969
 the second did not change my eating habits 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.139
 and just built a system so that 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:23.320
 calories 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:25.630
 got well with its consumption 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.700
 well the process of his life and 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.510
 costs have to be a little more than 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.280
 but what thought comes to him 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.070
 there is such a question with me sometimes 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.690
 But how is it that we only have a 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.720
 there is something you want 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:45.730
 and sometimes we love to eat here too 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.690
 know sergey that you are an expert 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.040
 also about nutrition and you know very well that 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.240
 can be adjusted 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:07:01.230
 eating without changing diets is very important 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:04.360
 and principle there are such helpers we have 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.070
 products that help helps me 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.010
 would like you to tell it yourself 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.960
 that you yourself are a big specialist and you 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.350
 you know what may be for modesty and 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.970
 Sergei not always tell about themselves that 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.000
 he is really a big specialist in 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.310
 this area here I literally today 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.700
 opened his general 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.010
 genealogy network reviewed and looked 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.500
 that this month he has customers from 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.480
 around the world 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:36.010
 literally this month in it spain 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:38.080
 Germany, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.880
 help someone to register yet 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.520
 have not bought this product yet with some 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.770
 I don't remember the country but you can actually 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:50.680
 probably study the map 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:54.310
 all customers and countries from countries that 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.310
 buy up
