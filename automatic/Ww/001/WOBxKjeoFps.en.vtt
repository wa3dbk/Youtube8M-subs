00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.940
 the measurements in inches 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.940
 if you have not measured in inches 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:59.570
 the total value of the measure and divide 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:00.840
 two inches in case you already have 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.900
 employee 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.140

 what 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.800
 of these 14 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.130
