00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.539
 franchini ciao 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.959
 my name is paolo d'amico I am inside the scion canon 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.289
 I had the privilege of being able to find the canon mark ii eos 5d mark 2 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.079
 the latest in digital reflex 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.980
 it is a machine that is really amazing is that actually that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.960
 I had read on the internet is that I believe all of you have read and have been there 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.899
 waiting for 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.120
 right a feature on all 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 is the ability to shoot video in full hd 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.540
 1009 20 per thousand octane 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.130
 this thanks to a sensor moved to fool frame by twenty one. 1 megapixel 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.520
 and to another digic manager 4 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.839
 14 bit windows be a lot 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.829
 fast that improves the signal ratio a lot 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.780
 what noise 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.130
 if you have not seen it I invite you to go and see on the internet you can 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.970
 quietly looking for the video shot by luisella score entitled reveri Ã¨ 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.590
 a spectacular video a hard video where 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 lee 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 possibility the potential of this spot is at least expressed 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.880
 in the video it takes place. at night 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.759
 email cern on the fly 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 over an illuminated Manhattan 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.310
 it is extraordinary e 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.600
 undoubtedly 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.640
 you can see how despite the poor lighting 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.810
 web the best in from very well without 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.400
 increase noise 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.500
 there image always talking about the processing speed of the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.080
 digic 4 processor we need to detect a very important feature 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.590
 that of allowing the machine to take three IOS 5 d mark 2 ds. 9 almost 4 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.200
 frames per second 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.430
 in gite format we can do 300 consecutive shots this means that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 we can almost tell a story of facts this is the characteristic that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.540
 unit 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.390
 to the sensitivity in full format allows us to viral point of the videos in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.459
 full hd 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.000
 in ro format the quantity of shots is reduced but it is still considerable 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.880
 because we are talking about 13 consecutive shots 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.999
 not bad 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.659
 another thing that impressed me of this camera 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.989
 the size and sharpness of the display 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.079
 we are talking about a lie display 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.979
 for 3 inches then you are 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.709
 s ... 44 80 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.269
 a very clear display 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.239
 they ask me if it's welcome to read if preview phase 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.889
 and above all a feature that I really didn't expect 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.829
 delivery of 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.349
 lcd author and a hard and sad function that allows you to adjust the brightness 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.620
 the brightness intensity of the display 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.200
 depending on the amount of light that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.859
 it's in the environment 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.479
 souls to which I find myself therefore if I have greater illumination 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.450
 the display 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.389
 will require 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.989
 lower consumption also of battery therefore a longer battery life 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.869
 precisely because it will reduce the intensity of the lighting 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.869
 when instead I need more display brightness 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.109
 the machine is a remarkable cholera author 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.700
 in addition to this the possibility of having 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.500
 a like you that allows us to turn euros in the meantime. the videos 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.870
 inna full hd 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.950
 consulting display covers a real or display ideas of a 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.580
 camcorder and moreover the possibility of exploiting a field angle of 170 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.249
 think ranks 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.549
 photos of crowd situations 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.319
 in which we must raise our camera and still have one 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.549
 absolutely excellent display readability 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.669
 I want you to actually see what I mean by brightness and 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.159
 display sharpness 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.369
 also look at moving more fluid image tags have 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:10.349
 and how bright 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.760
 moreover for me in a little while we can on the sea inside the frame 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.870
 up to 10 tees we will have an absolutely optimal focus 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.930
 also to allow you to watch I kept myself at a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.559
 angle exactly d 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:25.599
 160 degrees more or less 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.550
 I could still increase by 10 degrees without losing reading goddess 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.440
 of the display 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.090
 absolutely exceptional 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.169
 I am not in the pre-order phase of Rome even in phases of reading the welcome 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.220
 the display is also very useful 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.060
 look also is where they moved into any santa they will spend spinal tap 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.279
 very readable very bright 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.990
 I'm sure many of you thinking of a will be full format 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.300
 will have thought about peripheral lighting problems 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.960
 well this would be true if we didn't have a digic iii digic 4 processor like 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.550
 we have in the a5 of erna 2 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.460
 to worry about automatically correcting the problems of 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.169
 then peripheral domination 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.139
 in the corners 1 Italian 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.259
 thanks to the calculation speed mc-14 vitellianarum sto bg 4 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.280
 the same Italian lighting at the center of the sensor 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.460
 another feature of the 5d mark 2 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.319
 and the fact of ene 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.939
 to be able to shoot in three formative gold pro 1 euro 2 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.420
 what does this mean 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.070
 we all know that the neo sformato ro has the characteristic of having one 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.680
 higher color depth 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.960
 more so when we talk about a 4 14 life digic processor 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.349
 64 times higher than a Muscat 8 bit free 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.520
 luigi tenco 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.599
 however the disadvantage is obviously that of occupying 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.979
 a much larger space 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.770
 with euro 1 euro 2 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.030
 we have a 14 bit image so with one 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.060
 considerable color depth but without going to occupy the promo space 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.580
 traditional choir one we occupy half of the space with the nano 2 exactly 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.849
 a quarter 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.289
 insights on the eos 5d mark 2 have ended unfortunately this too is over 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.430
 day - 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.869
 touch left this jewel 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:23.129
 but I enjoyed it 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.969
 try it 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.989
 I'm sure you'll have fun too
