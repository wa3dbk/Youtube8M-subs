of a sudden something out of the

of a sudden something out of the

there's<00:01:58.250> their<00:01:58.550> coat<00:01:58.789> them<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.149> retire<00:01:59.679> shame

there's their coat them to retire shame

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.330 
there's their coat them to retire shame
I<00:02:00.920> think<00:02:01.220> perhaps<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:02.860> he's<00:02:03.860> not<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
I think perhaps that he's not on the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.100 
I think perhaps that he's not on the
radio<00:02:04.520> guy<00:02:04.909> if<00:02:05.210> he<00:02:05.390> was<00:02:05.479> still<00:02:05.690> plugged<00:02:05.960> into

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
radio guy if he was still plugged into

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.870 
radio guy if he was still plugged into
the<00:02:06.259> radio<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.679> some<00:02:06.860> way<00:02:07.009> shape<00:02:07.250> or<00:02:07.369> form<00:02:07.429> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
the radio in some way shape or form the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.279 
the radio in some way shape or form the
team<00:02:08.090> might<00:02:08.450> perhaps<00:02:08.660> suggest<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.229> him

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
team might perhaps suggest to him

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.350 
team might perhaps suggest to him
getting<00:02:09.679> back<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:09.950> he's<00:02:10.130> only<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.940> exits

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
getting back in he's only and the exits

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.580 
getting back in he's only and the exits
of<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.510> Dunlop<00:02:11.810> curves<00:02:12.110> there<00:02:12.350> that's

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
of the Dunlop curves there that's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.259 
of the Dunlop curves there that's
between<00:02:12.860> there<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.220> not<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.430> exit<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:13.850> he's

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
between there was not the exit but he's

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.479 
between there was not the exit but he's
in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.500> straight<00:02:16.010> between<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> two

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
in the to the straight between the two

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.860 
in the to the straight between the two
left<00:02:16.670> handers<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> Dunlop<00:02:17.269> curves<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.660> think

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
left handers the Dunlop curves I think

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.410 
left handers the Dunlop curves I think
there<00:02:18.019> if<00:02:18.769> there's<00:02:19.100> anything<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.940> can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
there if there's anything that can

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.840 
there if there's anything that can
possibly<00:02:20.690> get<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> car<00:02:21.620> going<00:02:21.860> he<00:02:22.489> might<00:02:22.519> be

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
possibly get the car going he might be

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.280 
possibly get the car going he might be
in<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> position<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.510> able<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.720> drive<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.170> or

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
in a position to be able to drive it or

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.809 
in a position to be able to drive it or
crawl<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.739> somehow<00:02:24.980> backs<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> bits<00:02:25.640> it's

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
crawl it somehow backs the bits it's

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.240 
crawl it somehow backs the bits it's
less<00:02:26.060> than<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.690> half<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.260> mile<00:02:27.440> from<00:02:27.470> from<00:02:28.100> that

less than a half a mile from from that
distance<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.820> maybe<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.690> they've

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
distance and maybe if they've

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.300

extinguished<00:02:30.380> whatever<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.739> fire<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.070> even

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
extinguished whatever the fire is even

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.860 
extinguished whatever the fire is even

if it's lost want back and cylinders or

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.840 
if it's lost want back and cylinders or
one<00:02:33.079> turbo<00:02:33.470> or<00:02:33.620> something<00:02:33.920> like<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.280> unless

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
one turbo or something like that unless

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.750 
one turbo or something like that unless
it's<00:02:35.299> destroyed<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.019> gearbox<00:02:36.610> there<00:02:37.610> is

it's destroyed the gearbox there is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's destroyed the gearbox there is
perhaps<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.209> chance<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.510> firing<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.900> car<00:02:39.049> up

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
perhaps the chance of firing the car up

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.990 
perhaps the chance of firing the car up
and<00:02:39.350> somehow<00:02:39.709> chugging<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.400> back<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.579> mean<00:02:40.850> if

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and somehow chugging it back I mean if

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.759 
and somehow chugging it back I mean if
you<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.570> when<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> smoke<00:02:42.019> dies<00:02:42.230> down

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
you know when the smoke dies down

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.280 
you know when the smoke dies down
it<00:02:43.010> might<00:02:43.280> be<00:02:43.400> worth<00:02:43.579> his<00:02:43.850> time<00:02:44.420> trying<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.140> get

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it might be worth his time trying to get

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.280 
it might be worth his time trying to get
into<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
into the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.259 
into the
give<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.950> another<00:02:47.159> go<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.519> saw<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.879> Tyrion

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
give it another go we saw what Tyrion

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.530 
give it another go we saw what Tyrion
could<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.659> with<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.890> well<00:02:50.340> nothing<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.299> front

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
could do with with well nothing in front

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.940 
could do with with well nothing in front
of<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.719> windscreen<00:02:51.989> effectively<00:02:52.620> apart<00:02:52.829> from

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
of the windscreen effectively apart from

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.520 
of the windscreen effectively apart from
the<00:02:53.069> engine<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.670> his<00:02:54.000> car<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.290> would

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the engine on on his car so if it would

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.979 
the engine on on his car so if it would
fire<00:02:55.799> up<00:02:55.829> maybe<00:02:56.310> I'd<00:02:57.060> get<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.299> chance<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.719> get<00:02:57.840> it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
fire up maybe I'd get a chance to get it

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.750 
fire up maybe I'd get a chance to get it
back<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.560> perhaps<00:02:58.769> who<00:02:59.010> knows<00:02:59.219> he'll<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.609> very

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
back and perhaps who knows he'll be very

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.949 
back and perhaps who knows he'll be very
difficult<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.269> you're<00:03:00.420> looking<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.719> fire

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
difficult but you're looking at the fire

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.690 
difficult but you're looking at the fire
certainly<00:03:01.469> on<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.709> side<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.219> we<00:03:02.250> reckon<00:03:02.609> it'd

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
certainly on one side so we reckon it'd

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.640 
certainly on one side so we reckon it'd
be<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> turbo<00:03:03.180> fire<00:03:03.359> so<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.079> start<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.470> fire

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
be a turbo fire so if you start to fire

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.170 
be a turbo fire so if you start to fire

that's<00:04:07.990> probably<00:04:08.140> probably<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.190> worst

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
that's probably probably the worst

things I've ever done in my life I did a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.120 
things I've ever done in my life I did a
lap<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.450> slicks<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.830> was<00:04:14.980> dreadful

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
lap on slicks and it was dreadful

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.940 
lap on slicks and it was dreadful
dreadful<00:04:15.640> but<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.930> conditions<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.709> looks

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
dreadful but the conditions it looks

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.470 
dreadful but the conditions it looks
like<00:04:18.190> it's<00:04:18.549> getting<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.880> little<00:04:19.060> bit<00:04:19.299> better

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
like it's getting a little bit better

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.350 
like it's getting a little bit better
but<00:04:20.410> very<00:04:21.070> very<00:04:21.250> difficult<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:22.090> lot<00:04:22.120> of

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
but very very difficult and a lot of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.960 
but very very difficult and a lot of
cars<00:04:22.660> going<00:04:22.990> off<00:04:23.610> which<00:04:24.610> presumably

cars going off which presumably

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.400 
cars going off which presumably
obviously<00:04:25.480> means<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:25.990> cars<00:04:26.169> coming

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
obviously means a lot of cars coming

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
in the corners I mean how little of a

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.090 
in the corners I mean how little of a
racing<00:04:31.810> line<00:04:31.960> is<00:04:32.169> they're<00:04:32.350> out<00:04:32.500> there<00:04:32.740> now<00:04:32.770> for

you guys but there isn't a racing line
at<00:04:35.169> all<00:04:35.320> at<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> moment<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:36.100> mean<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.460> did

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
at all at the moment I mean it did

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.030 
at all at the moment I mean it did
everywhere<00:04:37.210> has<00:04:37.570> got<00:04:37.780> some<00:04:37.960> gravel<00:04:38.410> bits<00:04:38.860> of

everywhere has got some gravel bits of
car

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
car

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.820 
car
it's<00:04:41.120> just<00:04:41.390> also<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.170> prototype<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.710> go

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
it's just also in the prototype to go

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.710 
it's just also in the prototype to go
past<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.610> just<00:04:43.790> cannot<00:04:44.120> see<00:04:44.360> your<00:04:44.510> thing

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
past you you just cannot see your thing

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.160 
past you you just cannot see your thing
so<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:46.730> it's<00:04:47.030> pretty<00:04:47.210> nasty<00:04:47.420> other<00:04:47.750> one<00:04:47.900> I

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170
