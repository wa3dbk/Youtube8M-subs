super health benefits if you like but
the<00:03:08.580> three<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.330> concerned<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.930> today<00:03:10.080> are

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the three I'm concerned with today are

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.670 
the three I'm concerned with today are
that<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.519> stabilizes<00:03:12.060> blood<00:03:12.630> sugar<00:03:12.900> level<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that it stabilizes blood sugar level the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680 
that it stabilizes blood sugar level the
polysaccharides<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:14.940> actually<00:03:15.420> help

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
polysaccharides in there actually help

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.320 
polysaccharides in there actually help
blunt<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.739> insulin<00:03:17.280> effects<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.150> is

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
blunt the insulin effects so this is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.570 
blunt the insulin effects so this is
great<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:18.840> you're<00:03:19.019> having<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:20.010> before<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
great if you're having it before a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.300

bigger carb containing meal just early
in<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.519> day<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.090> will<00:03:24.269> help<00:03:24.480> blunt<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
in the day it will help blunt the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.930 
in the day it will help blunt the
instrument<00:03:25.530> effect<00:03:25.860> throughout<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.700> day
