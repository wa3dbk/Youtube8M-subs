00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.420
 good afternoon with you natalya popova and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.610
 the online bio project is better today we 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.219
 you will talk about the detachment 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.560
 Coleoptera on the example of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.180
 May beetle 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.910
 cockroach detachment refers to insects 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.769
 with full transformation 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.210
 is a change of the following 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.820
 stages this egg 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 larva pupa and then adult 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 insect beetle head semi 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 movably connected behind the chest on the head 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.610
 there are two complex faceted eyes barely 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.590
 lamella antennae 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 oral apparatus and gnawing type so as 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.350
 May beetles feed on young leaves 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 trees on the second and third pectoral 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.989
 segments of the cockchafer have wings when 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 This is the first pair of glue and in which 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.690
 It located on the first thoracic segment and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 this is hard elytra which during 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 flights are moving apart these 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.010
 elytra and protect the second pair of wings 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.229
 and the whole body of the Maybug 2 pairs of wings 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 which is located on the third chest 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.540
 segment this webbed flying 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.220
 wings from the ventral side of the pectoral 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 segments 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 located limbs that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 are running il n'y and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.869
 legs of articular structure at the end of legs 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.409
 There are claws that help May 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 beetle 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 and clinging to the branches of the trees the chest is not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 movably connected to the abdomen of the abdomen 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.329
 consists of eight segments 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 beetle digestive system 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.170
 starts by mouth and then sip follows 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.869
 the esophagus which expands into a tooth and 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 muscular stomach further follows 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.990
 midgut and posterior gut at the border 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 between the middle back gut is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 Many Malpighi vessels that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.750
 flow into the intestine malpighi you and the vessel 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.520
 are an organ excretion a 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.940
 also to the body of allocation include 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.200
 fatty body that may beetle 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.560
 located on the dorsal side and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.630
 covers all organs 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 and the fat body acts like a kidney 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.910
 accumulation also fat body 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.569
 accumulates nutrients which 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.000
 help at the time of egg maturation 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.910
 sides of the last two thoracic segments and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.810
 on the sides of all abdominal segments 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.300
 spiracles are located 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.750
 or breathing holes that 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.269
 trachea begin trachea inside the body 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.930
 beetle branch and braid 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.970
 all respiratory organs only Troch cial 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.299
 that is, other respiratory organs in 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.540
 May beetle is not and he breathes with 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.930
 abdominal vibrations while reducing abdomen 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 air and fears are pushed out while 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.890
 expansion of the abdomen the air is sucked in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.190
 trachea circulatory system open 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.930
 game type lymph transparent have heart 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.980
 it is located on the dorsal side 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.000
 abdomen multi-chamber tubular heart 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.820
 inside there are special valves which 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.459
 allow dima lymph to flow in only one 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.480
 direction from back to front 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.250
 end behind the heart is closed and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.920
 heme lymph absorbed through the steam 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.350
 holes that are in each 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.440
 the chamber of the heart is the heart of the multi-chamber 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.750
 and the front of the heart continues to the aorta 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.950
 which carries oxidized yuhema lymph 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.590
 head the nervous system consists of 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.139
 paired brain about pharyngeal 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.359
 nerve ring and abdominal nervous 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.060
 chains 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.680
 May beetles separated from female May 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.590
 beetles are larger than males 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.859
 and the sex glands are paired in 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.340
 abdomen females have a pair of ovaries 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.350
 male pair of testes 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.170
 fertilization inside and after 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.620
 fertilization female lays soil 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.859
 eggs while she digs 30-40 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.980
 centimeters and deep into and after laying 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:20.269
 the eggs of the female die and this happens 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:24.169
 in spring and then from eggs after about 30 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.030
 40 days go larvae externally 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.920
 do not look like an adult insect 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.730
 we they are white in a circle of them 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.220
 transparent and soft through these covers 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.040
 you can see the trachea and intestines 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.389
 filled with earth so as the larvae 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.910
 feed on humus 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.139
 on their thoracic segments there are three pairs 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.750
 articulate legs the head of the larva is covered 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.660
 durable brown chitin capsule 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.360
 colored larva during the summer feeds on 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.540
 with humus and then penetrate deeper into 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.820
 the ground and thus winters in spring 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.510
 the larva rises again from the ground and 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.610
 feeds on plant roots mainly 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.310
 young plants and thus a 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.940
 cause damage to agriculture then 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.350
 There are larvae of the May beetle are pests 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.500
 development of the larva occurs over 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.950
 four years and after 4 winterings 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.160
 and the larva pupa pupa May 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.840
 beetle does not eat does not move has 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.120
 durable chitinous cover 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.910
 fall out of the larvae young 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.750
 chafer and that digs into 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.830
 the ground and winter inside the soil in spring in 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.460
 early may beetles emerge from the soil then 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.830
 continue their mouth and after 5-7 weeks 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.080
 perish and so today we reviewed 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.600
 cockroach detachment by the example of May 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.479
 beetle next time we talk about 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.310
 a detachment of butterflies or lepidoptera with you 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.820
 There was Natalia Popova and the project online 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.820
