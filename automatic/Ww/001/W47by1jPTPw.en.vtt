00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.920
&gt;&gt;NEIL LANDMAN: In about 1998 or so, I put out an APB around the world

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.400
to see if anybody could find a giant squid.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.340
Because I study ancient organisms, but I’m
also interested in their modern cousins.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.750
I think it was just toward the end—about
’98, ’99—and I got a phone call that a colleague

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.280
in New Zealand had just found a giant squid
and would I be interested. And my answer was,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.180
“Absolutely.” As I got off the phone I
wondered what had I just agreed to because

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.750
how am I going to get this giant squid from
New Zealand into the portals

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.400
of the American Museum of Natural History.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.590
My name is Neil Landman. I’m the Curator-in-Charge
of Invertebrate Paleontology.

[SHELF LIFE THEME MUSIC]

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.660
&gt;&gt;MARK SIDDALL: The giant squid is among the largest invertebrates on the planet. They get to that size from

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.599
something very, very small. In fact, the average
size of a giant squid egg is on the vicinity

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.240
of a millimeter long, total. And then they
grow to these enormous things. I think that’s

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880
terrifically fascinating.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.840
I’m Mark Siddall, Curator of Invertebrates
at the American Museum of Natural History.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.060
The giant squid has captivated people for
a very long time. The idea that there are

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.360
enormous things in the sea that are elusive
and can’t be seen very easily is itself fascinating.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.100
But really, giant squid are probably not that
rare. Giant squid are in the North Atlantic.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.720
They’re in the South Atlantic. They’re
in the North Pacific. They’re in the South Pacific.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.420
Really, all around the globe, and
probably in fairly sensible numbers. Otherwise,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.940
what would be feeding all the sperm whales?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.660
And sperm whales certainly love to eat giant squid.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.260
Why we haven’t been able to see them so
well partly has to do with exploration. They’re

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.910
not down at the very bottom of the ocean.
They’re not right up at the top of the ocean.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.340
They’re in those mid-level depths. And,
in fact, that’s the part of the ocean that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.280
we still need to go and explore in much more
detail than we have already.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.760
&gt;&gt;LANDMAN: This particular specimen is about 30 feet
long from tip to tip. It was actually captured

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.890
by fishermen off the coast of New Zealand. So, how do you even book passage

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.670
for a giant squid? I mean, you know, it has
to go by air. It was frozen solid.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.810
It was shipped in a refrigerated truck from
Wellington to Auckland, where it boarded a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.530
flight bound for L.A. It was supposed to make
a connection from L.A. to New York and that’s

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.610
where we began to worry because apparently
it missed its connection. I thought, “Oh,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.850
it’s just going to melt on some runway and
that’s going to be the end of our dream.”

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.840
Fortunately, it managed to make the next plane out.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.810
When the giant squid arrived at Kennedy Airport,
a forklift started bringing it toward us,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.510
but then the Customs officials realized that
we needed paperwork. You know, this was the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.030
first time they had ever had a giant squid
delivered. So, there was a lot of consternation.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.260
Until the general decision was that we would
call this frozen seafood, sushi. They came

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.600
up with a tariff of $10 to clear it for Customs

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.180
and we left with the squid in the refrigerator truck.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.180
Back at the Museum, we laid it out as best
we could to let it start thawing. It was in

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.500
really great shape.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.790
I was interested in comparing the jaw of the
giant squid to the jaws of a fossil cephalopod,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.790
from an ammonite. And this animal afforded me the opportunity to study the jaw.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.220
What we realized is we needed to preserve it somehow.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.980
So, we injected the giant squid with formalin
and then, now, we had to somehow get it into

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.319
a bath of ethanol. All together it was several
hundred pounds. It was a little top heavy.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:27.430
So, you had to really balance it and everybody
was to try to get it into the container in

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.090
one piece. And it worked.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.810
&gt;&gt;SIDDALL: This is one of the best preserved giant squids in any collection, anywhere. Now, we’ve

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.900
known about giant squids going back to the
1500s, in terms of finding specimens. They

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.000
were first described as Architeuthis dux in
the 1800s. Since then we have now had up to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.060
20 or so names for different species of Architeuthis.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.050
But some of these different species of giant
squid are from partial specimens—usually things

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.419
that are washed up on shore. We also know
about giant squid from the stomach contents

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.610
of sperm whales. But of course, those are
chewed up and really, what we get from those

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.630
are just the hard parts, like the beak, and
maybe some of the suckers. So, having a really

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.889
well-preserved specimen here in the Museum
for study is terrifically important.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.800
The giant squid we have here at the
Museum—it’s labeled as Architeuthis kirkii.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.070
Now, over the course of time, people thought,
well, the one from South Africa’s a different

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.990
species. The one from New Zealand is a different
species. The one from the North Atlantic is

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.110
different from the one from the Pacific. We
now know from mitochondrial DNA analysis that,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.370
in fact, it all appears to be one species.
Given that Architeuthis dux was the very first

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.220
name for any one of these, it carries priority
and thus Architeuthis dux applies to all of

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.669
the giant squid.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.270
What we need to do on a continuing basis is
as the science changes, when we learn new

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.470
things about synonymy—that, for example,
two species are really one species, or the

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.210
opposite, that one species is really two species,
we need to be able to find what it was called

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.419
before. You actually end up having multiple
labels inside the jar. Or in this case, a

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.169
very large tank.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.040
&gt;&gt;LANDMAN: For me to look at it for the first time, it
was looking into this mythical creature, this

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.100
sense of seeing something that humans
have dreamed about for hundreds of years,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.340
here was finally- I was face to face with
the giant squid.
