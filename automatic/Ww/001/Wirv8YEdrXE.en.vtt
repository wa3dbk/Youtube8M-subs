 so and people with great life experience 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 no matter how old you are if you introduce 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.079
 strength training your lifestyle and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.390
 your quality of life will improve when we 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.119
 increasing our body mass 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.670
 starts spending more energy on our 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.939
 muscles need food to restore these 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 muscles need food and all this our body takes 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 from carbohydrates and fats 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.909
 that is, when we train with 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.700
 weighting we can spend fat two 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.250
 in ways the first is our body will 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.530
 use energy from fat for example 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.399
 to recover to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.690
 build new muscles and heal what 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.869
 equipment 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.360
 prepare and inflicted and the second way as we 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.540
 will burn fat is that in order 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.710
 to train we need energy and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.050
 naturally after doing 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.040
 use glucose she already use 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.270
 fats as a source of energy to get 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.340
 strength for training 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.840
 however how it would be great if we 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.640
 could transform fat and muscle and thereby 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.610
 spend even more energy and be your own 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.950
 strict unfortunately turn fat and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.310
 muscles are impossible very often i see 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 workout names transform your live 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.290
 in muscle or article titles and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 certain magazines that promise 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.390
 that fats and can be turned into muscle 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.490
 but unfortunately this is not true and 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.030
 specific answer to the question whether it is possible 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.330
 turn fat into muscle and thats not all 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.620
 the fact is that fat and this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.600
 certain tissue of our body and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.520
 muscle mass consists of can be considered 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.010
 stone is a completely different fabric 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.220
 of our body, they and the construction of such 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.320
 different that no one mechanism and one or 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.140
 under what condition the body cannot 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.360
 turn and fat in the muscle but not worth it 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.300
 grieve we can do everything ourselves as 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.590
 it is necessary that we can spend fats and 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.020
 build muscle 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.120
 naturally the process is not to waste i fat and 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.390
 build and muscle at the same time will 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.920
 a little super because it's a little 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.200
 opposite processes 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.650
 and if you want to know more precisely how 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.600
 spend fats and how to build muscle 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.180
 come to us at the same time 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.880
 exclusive club and I promise you that you 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 you will spend fat and build your body 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.870
 dream but that is another question 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.690
 what do you think if we can't 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.670
 turn fat into muscle what happens 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.390
 with fat when we spend it what 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.580
 happens when we lose weight is removed the same 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.190
 whether I digest it comes out 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.210
 us out of the body in some other way 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.980
 if you know or 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.110
 Assumptions write in the comments will be 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.870
 interesting to read by the way this question 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.970
 not even good ones can answer 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.520
 professional personal trainers
