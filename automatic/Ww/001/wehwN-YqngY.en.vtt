00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.010 
I seem to think of that there and in my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
opinion they're pretty impressive

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.620 
opinion they're pretty impressive

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
then you heard it earlier through the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.980 
then you heard it earlier through the
amplifier<00:01:55.659> there<00:01:56.500> are<00:01:56.560> PA<00:02:03.720> again<00:02:04.720> this<00:02:04.840> is

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
amplifier there are PA again this is

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.640 
amplifier there are PA again this is
gates<00:02:05.200> dude
