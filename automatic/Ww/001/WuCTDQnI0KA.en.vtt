00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the professional hunter of Miranda 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.730
 leads to a new position that is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.400
 find near a small lagoon 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.730
 it is before an open space where it has 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.280
 seen several nor eating them 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.070
 while the huge African sun sets 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.869
 thomÃ© begins to detect movement and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.490
 the nyala begin to appear by the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 trails that reach the prairies 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.120
 when I'm in a position in a tree I know 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.190
 that if I stay still I do not move and I 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.239
 I limit myself to observe them the animals 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.239
 they will approach and they will not see me 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.820
 install posts in trees in africa is 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.039
 a great idea because you can not move 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.170
 near these animals and you can not 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.480
 climb these trees have spikes or 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.949
 do not install and look for trails that use 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 these animals that move to your 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.230
 around 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 and there's nothing more exciting already 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.010
 hunting a white-tailed deer or a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.229
 African animal that the animals 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.530
 approach pass below and do not know that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.530
 you are there 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 will fall yes 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.540
 it is a very very big 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.409
 it is very difficult to approach those animals 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.930
 with a bow and it's even harder 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.570
 hunt them from a tree but we have 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 done to perfection has fallen right there 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.550
 It has been an incredible hunt when 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.080
 this has gone up a tree are you 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.360
 installed and the animals start to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.670
 approaching is like you're hunting 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 a white-tailed deer in africa never 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.050
 you know that you will find all the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 days are like Christmas morning but 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.200
 this was the one we were looking for 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.890
 we knew that there were some 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 we had seen great footprints this 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 it has huge horns and we have not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.280
 had to wait almost nothing
