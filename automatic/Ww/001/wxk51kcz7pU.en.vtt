00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.430 

rotate<00:03:25.760> like<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:28.610> could<00:03:28.790> rotate<00:03:29.440> but

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
rotate like this it could rotate but

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.400 
rotate like this it could rotate but
they<00:03:30.560> can<00:03:30.800> go<00:03:30.980> up<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.030> down<00:03:32.210> like<00:03:32.420> be<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.230> can

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
they can go up and down like be it can

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.500 
they can go up and down like be it can
only<00:03:33.590> rotate<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:36.940> that's<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.060> one<00:03:38.240> little

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
only rotate so that's a one little

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.850 
only rotate so that's a one little
drawback<00:03:38.720> right<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:40.600> but<00:03:41.600> um<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.260> still<00:03:42.650> I

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
drawback right there but um I still I

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.240 
drawback right there but um I still I
still<00:03:42.920> love<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.720> transformer<00:03:44.720> he<00:03:45.620> has<00:03:45.830> waste

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
still love this transformer he has waste

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.080 
still love this transformer he has waste
articulation<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.360> here<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.459> was<00:03:49.459> 360<00:03:50.860> he<00:03:51.860> has
