desires<00:00:27.470> we<00:00:27.650> have<00:00:27.829> is<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.700> get<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.119> kind<00:00:29.330> of

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
desires we have is to get this kind of

desires we have is to get this kind of
let's<00:00:30.170> say<00:00:30.320> sensibilities<00:00:30.980> into

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
let's say sensibilities into

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.189 
let's say sensibilities into

design<00:00:33.350> tools<00:00:35.199> we<00:00:36.199> always<00:00:36.500> work<00:00:36.650> with<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
design tools we always work with the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.189 
design tools we always work with the
computer<00:00:37.339> as<00:00:37.519> the<00:00:37.640> main<00:00:37.820> design<00:00:38.150> tool<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.080> we

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
computer as the main design tool but we

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.740 
computer as the main design tool but we
also<00:00:39.379> have<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.920> desire<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:41.180> make<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.540> physical

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
also have to desire to make the physical

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.770 
also have to desire to make the physical
what<00:00:42.260> we<00:00:42.379> create<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.920> computer<00:00:43.400> so<00:00:44.089> we<00:00:44.600> don't

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
what we create on a computer so we don't

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.630 
what we create on a computer so we don't
want<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.230> stay<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.469> rendering<00:00:45.860> that's<00:00:46.430> not

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
want it to stay a rendering that's not

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.190 
want it to stay a rendering that's not
enough<00:00:46.850> for<00:00:47.030> us<00:00:47.149> we<00:00:47.390> really<00:00:47.660> want<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.960> make<00:00:48.110> it

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
enough for us we really want to make it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.420 
enough for us we really want to make it
physically<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.829> way<00:00:50.440> at<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.500> beginning<00:00:51.620> you

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
physically in a way at the beginning you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.700 
physically in a way at the beginning you
start<00:00:52.489> making<00:00:53.270> models<00:00:53.960> by<00:00:54.079> hand<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.680> can

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
start making models by hand you can

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.459 
start making models by hand you can
actually<00:00:55.129> do<00:00:55.550> let's<00:00:56.480> say<00:00:56.570> models<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.140> complex

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
actually do let's say models of complex

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.189 
actually do let's say models of complex
curved<00:00:57.859> geometries<00:00:58.489> by<00:00:58.969> hand<00:00:59.329> I<00:00:59.420> mean<00:00:59.629> God<00:00:59.870> did

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
curved geometries by hand I mean God did

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.810 
curved geometries by hand I mean God did
that<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.440> hundred<00:01:00.800> years<00:01:00.980> ago<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:01.550> on<00:01:01.699> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
that a hundred years ago but on the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.639 
that a hundred years ago but on the
other<00:01:01.910> hand<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.420> very<00:01:02.449> time-consuming<00:01:02.870> you

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
other hand it is very time-consuming you

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.700 
other hand it is very time-consuming you
need<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:03.980> be<00:01:04.070> very<00:01:04.250> precise<00:01:05.289> it<00:01:06.289> is<00:01:06.470> something

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
need to be very precise it is something

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.680 
need to be very precise it is something
that<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.009> very<00:01:07.100> costing<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:08.300> you're

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
that is very costing because you're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.290 
that is very costing because you're
outsourced<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.350> most<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> time

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
outsourced that most of the time

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.960 
outsourced that most of the time
a<00:01:11.360> model<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> size<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.860> shoebox<00:01:13.070> would<00:01:13.700> take

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
a model the size of a shoebox would take

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.380 
a model the size of a shoebox would take
for<00:01:14.720> sure<00:01:14.900> for<00:01:15.170> 2<00:01:15.290> 5<00:01:15.500> 6<00:01:16.040> days<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.760> if<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.090> HP

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
for sure for 2 5 6 days and if the HP

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.600 
for sure for 2 5 6 days and if the HP
machine<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.780> same<00:01:17.990> size<00:01:18.260> would<00:01:18.560> take<00:01:18.830> 24

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
machine the same size would take 24

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.180 
machine the same size would take 24
hours<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.760> HP<00:01:23.300> designjet<00:01:23.420> 3d<00:01:24.380> provided<00:01:25.100> us

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
hours so the HP designjet 3d provided us

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.430 
hours so the HP designjet 3d provided us
with<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.460> possibility<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.450> increase<00:01:27.230> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
with the possibility to increase the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.860 
with the possibility to increase the
speed<00:01:27.770> which<00:01:27.980> means<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.610> save<00:01:28.870> several

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
speed which means that we save several

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.380 
speed which means that we save several
days<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.740> shipping<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:31.310> also<00:01:32.030> things

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
days and in shipping and also things

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.600 
days and in shipping and also things
every<00:01:33.140> day<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.620> get<00:01:33.800> more<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.490> can

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
every day that you get more that you can

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.850 
every day that you get more that you can
put<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.030> design<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.350> course<00:01:36.590> an

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
put in a design is of course an

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.940 
put in a design is of course an
advantage<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> competition<00:01:37.820> process

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.000 

it's<00:01:42.950> very<00:01:43.010> simple<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.670> use<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.480> actually

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
it's very simple to use it is actually

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.770 
it's very simple to use it is actually
just<00:01:46.010> sitting<00:01:46.220> there<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.820> working<00:01:47.060> basically

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
just sitting there and working basically

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.180 
just sitting there and working basically
like<00:01:48.020> one<00:01:48.230> of<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.440> other<00:01:48.530> guys<00:01:48.770> working<00:01:49.130> in

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
like one of the other guys working in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.420 
like one of the other guys working in
the<00:01:49.310> office<00:01:50.740> nothing<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.980> too<00:01:52.100> complicated

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
the office nothing is too complicated

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.430 
the office nothing is too complicated
for<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.880> machine<00:01:53.180> everything<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:54.320> you

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
for the machine everything that you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.770 
for the machine everything that you
designed<00:01:54.860> water<00:01:55.190> ties<00:01:55.460> on<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.730> computer<00:01:56.120> can<00:01:56.750> be

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
designed water ties on a computer can be

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.110 
designed water ties on a computer can be
3d<00:01:57.140> printed<00:01:57.500> no<00:01:57.800> matter<00:01:58.010> how<00:01:58.190> into<00:01:58.700> cater<00:01:58.940> of

3d printed no matter how into cater of
complicated<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:02.720> do<00:02:02.840> something<00:02:03.110> by

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
complicated it is to do something by

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.870 
complicated it is to do something by
hand<00:02:03.890> like<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:06.190> impossible<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.580> my<00:02:07.670> eyes

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
hand like this is impossible in my eyes

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.150 
hand like this is impossible in my eyes
and<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.960> another<00:02:09.230> technology<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.010> will<00:02:10.100> be

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and with another technology it will be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.310 
and with another technology it will be
very<00:02:10.460> very<00:02:10.730> difficult<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.750> get<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.020> kind<00:02:12.170> of

very very difficult to get this kind of

we're actually at the moment working on

we're actually at the moment working on

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
a high riser in China I don't think that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.220 
a high riser in China I don't think that
we<00:02:26.610> could<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.940> done<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.420> models<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.959> any

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
we could have done the models in any

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.900 
we could have done the models in any
other<00:02:28.440> way<00:02:28.680> faster<00:02:29.160> than<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.400> did<00:02:29.550> now<00:02:29.700> with

other way faster than we did now with

other way faster than we did now with
the<00:02:30.060> HP<00:02:30.450> designjet<00:02:30.600> 3d<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.760> gave<00:02:32.910> us

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the HP designjet 3d it really gave us

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.600 
the HP designjet 3d it really gave us
the<00:02:33.090> opportunity<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.750> react<00:02:34.560> very<00:02:34.709> fast<00:02:34.830> first

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the opportunity to react very fast first

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.760 
the opportunity to react very fast first
of<00:02:35.760> all<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.330> architectural<00:02:37.260> demands<00:02:37.590> of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
of all on the architectural demands of

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.680 
of all on the architectural demands of
course<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.160> our<00:02:38.250> design<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> other

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
course in our design but on the other

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.870 
course in our design but on the other
hand<00:02:39.989> also<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.650> could<00:02:40.830> react<00:02:41.100> very<00:02:41.280> fast<00:02:41.400> on

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
hand also we could react very fast on

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.780 
hand also we could react very fast on
the<00:02:42.060> specifics<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.319> customer<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:46.790> think

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the specifics of the customer I think

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.250 
the specifics of the customer I think
one<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> biggest<00:02:48.390> advantages<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
one of the biggest advantages of the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260 
one of the biggest advantages of the
machine<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:50.040> robustness<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> models

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
machine is a robustness of the models

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.330 
machine is a robustness of the models
that<00:02:51.480> dropped<00:02:51.870> one<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.590> models<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.190> were

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that dropped one of the models they were

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.940 
that dropped one of the models they were
made<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> HP<00:02:54.180> designjet<00:02:54.300> 3d<00:02:55.110> print<00:02:55.350> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
made with the HP designjet 3d print and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
made with the HP designjet 3d print and
I<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.220> oh<00:02:56.640> my<00:02:56.880> god<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.269> dropped<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
I was like oh my god I dropped it it

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.840 
I was like oh my god I dropped it it
dropped<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> floor<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.920> nothing

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
dropped on the floor and nothing

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.930 
dropped on the floor and nothing
happened<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:01.370> customers<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.670> course

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
happened for customers it's of course

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.360 
happened for customers it's of course
great<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.110> them<00:03:04.230> always<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> surprise<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
great it's for them always a surprise to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.550 
great it's for them always a surprise to
see<00:03:05.720> basically<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.870> they<00:03:07.019> are<00:03:07.050> gonna<00:03:07.260> have

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
see basically what they are gonna have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.960 
see basically what they are gonna have
at<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.800> end<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> day<00:03:08.280> when<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:08.550> build<00:03:08.760> it

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
at the end of the day when they build it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.509 
at the end of the day when they build it
in<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.750> very<00:03:10.050> detailed<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.920> sophisticated

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
in a very detailed and sophisticated

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.400 
in a very detailed and sophisticated
model<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.239> it's<00:03:12.330> very<00:03:12.480> satisfying<00:03:12.780> for

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
model I think it's very satisfying for

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.229 
model I think it's very satisfying for
them<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.340> sometimes<00:03:14.700> difficult<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
them it is sometimes difficult to

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.600 
them it is sometimes difficult to
understand<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.769> potential<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.459> an

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
understand the potential of an

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.850 
understand the potential of an
architectural<00:03:18.120> space<00:03:18.390> completely<00:03:18.900> only

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
architectural space completely only

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.430 
architectural space completely only
looking<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> 2d<00:03:21.090> drew<00:03:21.269> presentation<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.319> if

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
looking at a 2d drew presentation but if

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.530 
looking at a 2d drew presentation but if
you<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.100> 3d<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.819> really<00:03:24.239> if<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
you have it in 3d it's really if you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.750 
you have it in 3d it's really if you
take<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.140> hands<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.530> then<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.640> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
take it in your hands and then it's a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
take it in your hands and then it's a
german<00:03:27.060> word<00:03:27.090> called<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> griffin<00:03:28.200> yeah

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
german word called the griffin yeah

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.160 
german word called the griffin yeah
which<00:03:29.549> means<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:30.000> touch<00:03:30.239> something<00:03:30.570> but

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
which means we touch something but

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.950 
which means we touch something but
simultaneously<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.070> it

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.020
