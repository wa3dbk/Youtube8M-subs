00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
has gone away from this because why it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.760

too damn expensive

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.260 
too damn expensive
now<00:01:56.100> Toyota<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.700> said<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> know<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.180> we're

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
now Toyota they said you know what we're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
now Toyota they said you know what we're
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> keep<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.320> things<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going to keep some things now from a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
going to keep some things now from a
styling<00:02:00.149> standpoint<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:00.840> they've

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
styling standpoint I think they've

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
styling standpoint I think they've
really<00:02:01.170> borrowed<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.009> lot<00:02:02.310> maybe<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.000> too

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really borrowed a lot maybe a little too

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
really borrowed a lot maybe a little too
much<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> FJ<00:02:04.229> cruiser<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:05.189> not

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
much from the FJ cruiser that's not

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.760 
much from the FJ cruiser that's not
necessarily<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.000> bad<00:02:06.060> thing<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.740> of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
necessarily a bad thing but a lot of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.910 
necessarily a bad thing but a lot of
bulging<00:02:08.399> lights<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.179> back<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.869> front<00:02:10.080> very

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
bulging lights the back the front very

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
bulging lights the back the front very
reminiscent<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> FJ

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
reminiscent of the FJ

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.180 
reminiscent of the FJ
