review<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> keiki<00:00:10.679> 44<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> really

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
review on the keiki 44 it's a really

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.930 
review on the keiki 44 it's a really
strange<00:00:12.630> weapon<00:00:13.110> say<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.590> most<00:00:13.940> it's

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
strange weapon say the most it's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029 
strange weapon say the most it's
completely<00:00:15.599> catered<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.109> close<00:00:16.320> combat<00:00:16.650> on

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
completely catered to close combat on

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.340 
completely catered to close combat on
don't<00:00:17.609> even<00:00:17.699> bother<00:00:18.000> trying<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.510> medium<00:00:18.990> since

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
don't even bother trying to medium since

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.439 
don't even bother trying to medium since
or<00:00:19.560> long<00:00:19.770> distance<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> case<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
or long distance in the case like that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
or long distance in the case like that
arm<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> running<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> shotgun

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
arm is running like it's like a shotgun

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
arm is running like it's like a shotgun
it's<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.180> an<00:00:24.300> automatic<00:00:24.810> shotgun<00:00:25.279> you're

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it's like an automatic shotgun you're

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.130 
it's like an automatic shotgun you're
going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.580> no<00:00:26.820> chance<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.510> middle<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
going to have no chance at middle to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.660 
going to have no chance at middle to
long-range<00:00:28.349> LST<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.310> lucky<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
long-range LST are really lucky and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.209 
long-range LST are really lucky and
accuracy<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.810> helps<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> most

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
accuracy actually helps you but in most

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
accuracy actually helps you but in most
cases<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.730> accuracy<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.300> draw<00:00:33.510> off<00:00:33.630> your

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
cases the accuracy will draw off your

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389 
cases the accuracy will draw off your
aim<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> r<00:00:34.380> equal<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> roll<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.160> aim

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
aim and the r equal it roll off your aim

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.549 
aim and the r equal it roll off your aim
as<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
as well so it's basically one in a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
as well so it's basically one in a
minute<00:00:37.829> close<00:00:38.040> combat<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> you're<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
minute close combat and you're going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
minute close combat and you're going to
see<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> accuracy<00:00:40.140> test<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.980> anyways

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
see here in the accuracy test so anyways

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
see here in the accuracy test so anyways
um<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.180> moving<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.570> straight

based off the ak-47 in real life if you
guys<00:00:59.160> didn't<00:00:59.910> realize<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.719> some<00:01:00.870> very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
guys didn't realize out for some very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
guys didn't realize out for some very
strange<00:01:01.320> reason<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:02.789> running<00:01:03.149> over

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
strange reason so here I'm running over

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.570 
strange reason so here I'm running over
here<00:01:03.719> um<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.830> getting<00:01:04.949> accuracy

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
here um you know just getting accuracy

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
here um you know just getting accuracy
test<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> you're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
test and you're going to see how like is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
test and you're going to see how like is
recoil<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> ridiculously<00:01:09.030> bad<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.140> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
recoil is ridiculously bad and it just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.219 
recoil is ridiculously bad and it just
has<00:01:10.500> huge<00:01:11.010> recoil<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> new<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
has huge recoil and no a new and the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.340 
has huge recoil and no a new and the
muzzle<00:01:13.409> flash<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.280> acceptable<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.119> mean<00:01:15.350> but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
muzzle flash is no acceptable I mean but

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
muzzle flash is no acceptable I mean but
I'm<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> r<00:01:17.100> equal<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.520> gonna<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
I'm even in the r equal is gonna be a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
I'm even in the r equal is gonna be a
problem<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.509> time<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> split<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> look<00:01:19.799> at

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
problem at time to split I'm a look at

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
problem at time to split I'm a look at
that<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.670> coming<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.000> equal<00:01:21.299> there

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that and we're coming from equal there

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
that and we're coming from equal there
is<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.170> seriously

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
is that's going to be seriously

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
is that's going to be seriously
hindering<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.490> medium<00:01:24.210> range<00:01:24.360> capabilities

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
hindering your medium range capabilities

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
hindering your medium range capabilities
like<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.770> acted<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> wasn't<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
like you acted like it wasn't in the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
like you acted like it wasn't in the
first<00:01:27.720> place<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.770> long<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
first place so long you can see this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
first place so long you can see this
behaves<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.240> lot<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> shot<00:01:30.990> Johnny<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
behaves a lot like a shot Johnny it's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
behaves a lot like a shot Johnny it's
just<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.799> close-range<00:01:32.040> only<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> look<00:01:33.420> at

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
just for close-range only and look at

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
just for close-range only and look at
that<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> double<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.860> everywhere

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that on the double is just go everywhere

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
that on the double is just go everywhere
everywhere<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.020> that's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
point because if you sort of that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.000 
point because if you sort of that
because<00:02:50.700> my<00:02:50.940> previous<00:02:51.930> two<00:02:52.560> videos<00:02:52.590> are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
because my previous two videos are

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.970 
because my previous two videos are
really<00:02:53.190> short<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:53.970> um<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.630> think<00:02:55.440> those<00:02:55.710> little

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
really short but um I think those little

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.620 
really short but um I think those little
more<00:02:56.100> justify<00:02:56.520> sense<00:02:56.790> they're<00:02:56.940> such<00:02:57.180> popular

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
more justify sense they're such popular

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.090 
more justify sense they're such popular
weapons<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.350> one's<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.710> little<00:02:58.860> bit

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
about the classes but I mean we just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.860 
about the classes but I mean we just
look<00:03:11.010> at<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.490> it's<00:03:11.940> basically<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.390> same<00:03:12.630> I

mean it's pretty self-explanatory the
two<00:03:15.060> biggest<00:03:15.390> problems<00:03:15.960> or<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.470> accuracy<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
two biggest problems or the accuracy and

the grip the power is outstanding but I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.680 
the grip the power is outstanding but I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
mean it's to a point but it just became

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.440 
mean it's to a point but it just became
almost<00:03:22.020> unusable<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.370> distance<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.150> you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
almost unusable and a distance on you

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.090 
almost unusable and a distance on you

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you don't know what accuracy is um let's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.699 
you don't know what accuracy is um let's
see<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> think<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.600> arranged<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.380> ok

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
see I think the arranged on this is ok

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.500 
see I think the arranged on this is ok
but<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.520> Rangers<00:03:38.820> even<00:03:39.090> really<00:03:39.300> matter

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
but on the Rangers even really matter

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.050 
but on the Rangers even really matter
about<00:03:39.720> Andre<00:03:40.380> two<00:03:40.620> things<00:03:40.920> factoring<00:03:41.880> if

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
you're going to kill someone that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.320 
you're going to kill someone that
distance<00:03:43.530> there's<00:03:43.830> accuracy<00:03:44.580> which<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.090> um

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
distance there's accuracy which is um

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.290 
distance there's accuracy which is um
you<00:03:46.320> know<00:03:46.410> which<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.740> if<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.070> don't<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.490> it's

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
you know which is if you don't know it's

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.480 
you know which is if you don't know it's
the<00:03:48.930> probability<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.680> your<00:03:49.980> bullet<00:03:50.250> will<00:03:50.370> go

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
the probability that your bullet will go

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
something you cannot control it just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.120 
something you cannot control it just
come<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.950> weapon<00:03:56.420> weapons<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.560> dmca<00:03:58.560> t1<00:03:58.950> if

come to the weapon weapons I dmca t1 if

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.590 
come to the weapon weapons I dmca t1 if
you<00:03:59.220> saw<00:03:59.340> my<00:03:59.490> previous<00:03:59.910> video<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.209> saw<00:04:00.540> that

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you saw my previous video you saw that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.050 
you saw my previous video you saw that
all<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> bullets<00:04:01.230> are<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> tight<00:04:01.830> um<00:04:02.130> ton

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
all the bullets are in a tight um ton

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.940 
all the bullets are in a tight um ton
and<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.420> tight<00:04:03.630> spot<00:04:03.930> around<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.440> crate<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and a tight spot around the crate and

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.800 
and a tight spot around the crate and
that's<00:04:05.100> because<00:04:05.250> they're<00:04:05.820> actress<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
that's because they're actress is the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690 
that's because they're actress is the
guns<00:04:07.020> I've<00:04:07.200> ever<00:04:07.320> seen<00:04:07.530> accuracy<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.400> really

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
guns I've ever seen accuracy is really

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.100 
guns I've ever seen accuracy is really
good<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.540> means<00:04:09.660> all<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> those<00:04:10.050> are

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
good so that means all of those are

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.390 
good so that means all of those are
going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.500> going<00:04:10.680> at<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.980> same<00:04:11.160> place

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
going to be going at the same place

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.699 
going to be going at the same place
again<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.940> again<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.660> gun<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:12.989> not<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.500> same

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
again and again this gun is not the same

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.430 
again and again this gun is not the same
they'll<00:04:14.489> go<00:04:14.700> all<00:04:14.940> over<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.300> place<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:15.930> that's

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
they'll go all over the place so that's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.900 
they'll go all over the place so that's
a<00:04:16.530> problem<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.190> even<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.700> aim<00:04:17.880> it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
a problem and even if you aim it

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
a problem and even if you aim it
directly<00:04:18.209> at<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> person<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.440> get<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> r

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
directly at a person and you get the r

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.800 
directly at a person and you get the r
equal<00:04:20.070> one<00:04:20.190> hundred<00:04:20.430> percent<00:04:20.459> correct<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.480> the

bullets could go to the right and to the

bullets could go to the right and to the
