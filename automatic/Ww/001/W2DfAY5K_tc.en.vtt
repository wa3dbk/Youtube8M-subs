00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
ok the like the actual vibrations of the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400 
ok the like the actual vibrations of the
strings<00:00:17.730> they're<00:00:18.690> actually<00:00:18.930> being<00:00:18.990> picked<00:00:19.289> up

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
strings they're actually being picked up

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.070

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
by these all right and then they're

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320 
by these all right and then they're
being<00:00:22.260> amplified<00:00:22.529> through<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.670> amplifier

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
being amplified through the amplifier

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.400 
being amplified through the amplifier
obviously<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.430> here's<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.580> pickups<00:00:27.140> ok<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
pickup but in but in place of the pickup

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.819 
pickup but in but in place of the pickup
is<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.800> sound<00:00:44.160> hole<00:00:44.460> ok<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> sound

is this sound hole ok and what the sound
hole<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.520> literally<00:00:48.000> amplifies

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
hole does is that it literally amplifies

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
hole does is that it literally amplifies
without<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.670> amplifier<00:00:50.989> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
without the use of an amplifier the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.549 
without the use of an amplifier the
actual<00:00:52.410> sound<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> instrument<00:00:53.850> i<00:00:54.440> were<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actual sound of the instrument i were to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.520 
actual sound of the instrument i were to
cover<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.910> were<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.510> solid<00:00:58.350> body

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
cover this or if this were a solid body

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
cover this or if this were a solid body
maybe<00:00:58.920> wasn't<00:00:59.190> open<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.969> i<00:01:00.059> were<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> cover

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
maybe wasn't open if i were to cover

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
maybe wasn't open if i were to cover
that<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> play<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> hear

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that and play it then you want to hear

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.039 
that and play it then you want to hear
it<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> loud<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> old<00:01:05.909> days<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:07.020> used

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it as loud and in the old days they used

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.420 
it as loud and in the old days they used
to<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.710> guitars<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
to have guitars that were actually like

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.499 
to have guitars that were actually like
15<00:01:11.430> inches<00:01:11.820> wide<00:01:13.340> ok<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
15 inches wide ok like here and then the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
15 inches wide ok like here and then the
strings<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.080> thicker<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> would<00:01:16.890> be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
strings would be thicker and it would be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.789 
strings would be thicker and it would be
high<00:01:17.220> action<00:01:17.840> but<00:01:18.840> today<00:01:19.200> everyone<00:01:19.650> has

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
high action but today everyone has

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.320 
high action but today everyone has
amplifiers<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> really

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
amplifiers and you don't have to really

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.920 
amplifiers and you don't have to really
wear<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> too<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.350> ok<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.689> there's

is that it's not my finger that's
stopping<00:04:52.719> the<00:04:53.020> string<00:04:53.409> it's<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:54.460> threat<00:04:55.050> okay

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
stopping the string it's the threat okay

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.110 
stopping the string it's the threat okay
my<00:04:56.560> figure<00:04:56.949> just<00:04:57.099> pushes<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.639> string<00:04:57.939> down

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
my figure just pushes the string down

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.170 
my figure just pushes the string down
far<00:04:58.539> enough<00:04:58.569> so<00:04:59.409> that<00:04:59.439> the<00:04:59.710> fret<00:04:59.979> stops<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.669> so

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
far enough so that the fret stops it so

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.930 
far enough so that the fret stops it so
whether<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.479> plant
