00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.669
 When working with relative, there are some things to keep in mind 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.669
 I let's get percent in different dosage forms 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.910
 around and which one finds in recipes Blacha Latina as amount of percent there 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 and there is just here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.950
 so AndrÃ© Plath gossip four transparent feels like 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.890
 plastic 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.630
 But there are also in the community so Pohl abysmal forms 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.569
 I am now that there seemed to be alpine World Cup races 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.920
 and he's the first to get what you can do maybe not always 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 Do not soak in warm or hot water in cold water 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.520
 cold water 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.130
 simply sheet by sheet 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.360
 a bowl of water just think about the 10 each tine is pulling 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.870
 the water and then quickly rant that lasts 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 a few minutes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 that prepared 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 if the gelatin is then soaked with it, it is so 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.190
 the most numerous ones I still still shoot strength one can 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.400
 after that a soft still subtle individual leaves if you have to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.659
 Chile Chile is not allowed to cook that's one and it's raining but it still has to be 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.670
 Hermann Dudda reporter Finchen set up to include 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 got hot 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.100
 Siemens increases and decreases 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.640
 Pappert tricked 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.950
 So you see how fast the Latina dissolves then 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.820
 Now, when it's dissolved, it does not stop standing anymore 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.900
 cooking is broken 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.980
 It must be noted whether the gelatin in the hot or in the cold 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.500
 Would like to give liquids or meals 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.750
 More difficult are cold foods the moment I was with them now 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 Giving gelatin in a cold liquid will instantly squint or 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.270
 The first thing I have to do is to get a little bit of the cold liquid in it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.240
 Give Latina to adjust the temperatures 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 sometimes 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 so 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 Now I can swing that through or 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 Stir Resch 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:24.819
 Ulrike Barth 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.480
 has fallen a little bit since it can take months fingers Erhard Laube 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.869
 to have 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.029
 I can easily 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 pour whole thing together 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.269
 the Latina because the property that she cools when she writes for EMBA 2 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.119
 then he has reached me that is now fixed again that is 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.179
 assuming I have enough student Thiede under the above 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.509
 for those students Tine then stuck in the fridge that is if I am 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.879
 now 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.419
 and have weaknesses 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.449
 Dessert with the fridge that would leave me behind 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.639
 overturning stops 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.779
 it is easier to use Latina in hot liquid because 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.329
 there you can see the processes of the titles 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.579
 soaked in it 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.659
 around 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.119
 expressed 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.239
 along with the still cold liquid dish 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.100
 put on the stove to heat together or if I am here now 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.099
 AR 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.469
 Sunde Pharma liquid got free on the table Latin is 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.389
 Rheine does not present photo earlier as I said take note deadline anymore 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.490
 Hobs relatively Erfurt of goods 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.940
 Conclusion no binding
