pretty much similar obviously 2001 pair
is<00:02:35.450> yellow<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.680> carbon<00:02:37.040> fiber<00:02:37.280> plates<00:02:37.670> are

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
slightly different so if you see the

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.339 
slightly different so if you see the
