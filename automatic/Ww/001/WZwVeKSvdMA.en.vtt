Chapter 16
The Morning-After Pill 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.220
Mom!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.640
Juana! How wonderful to see you!

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.154
How was your journey?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.760
When I am in Chiapas, I travel along the river Usamacinta.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.560
 I really don’t enjoy travelling by road.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.160
Well your talks on sexuality are indispensable, 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.240
so your presence at the annual Health Fair is very important.  

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.121
I can’t wait to reach the parish church and rest a little. 

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.520
I don’t think that you’re going to rest much.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.313
Why not?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.900
Just wait, you’ll see what Father Beto has put in the church entrance.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.860
“The morning-after pill is a form of abortion."

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.320
"It also causes heart attacks and thrombosis."

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.940
"Attend my talk on the subject. Father Beto.”

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400
But Juana, those are complete lies! 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.460
And Father Beto is not even a doctor.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.360
I told you that you wouldn’t be able to relax.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360
It would be a tremendous mistake for women to attend that talk. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.200
We can’t allow it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.540
I have an idea. 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.360
Could you give a talk on emergency contraception on the same day as Father Beto’s one?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.500
Of course. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700
But we run the risk that no one comes.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.540
No Mom, Father Beto is the one risking that.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
Don Fede, I would like to order 40 tamales.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
They are for my talk on the morning-after pill.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.700
This way, I can assure that everyone attends.  

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.540
20 with chipilín, 10 with mole, and 5 with rajas...

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.075
Hello! 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.620
I am a spermatozoid, 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.600
and like millions of other sperms, I am looking for only one thing…

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.060
Miss Egg! 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But getting to paradise is not easy. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.140
For example, you leave the starting point 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.500
You reach the end of the track, 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.040
and fall into some rapids that carry you directly to glory.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.060
Along you flow,      

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.880
then you realize that the woman took the famous morning-after pill

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.660
 and it turns out that Miss Egg is asleep. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.640
And I will die without having fertilized the egg.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.360
Thank you. 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.480
Remember that this pill has to be taken 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.600
within the first five days after unprotected sex. 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.360
It is not effective once the implantation in the uterus has begun

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.120
the morning-after pill does not cause an abortion. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.720
Any questions?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.200
So why does the Church continue to condemn the morning-after pill?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480
I think that that’s a question for Sister Juana.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.480
This shouldn’t happen. Let me explain…

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.180
The Church’s teachings on contraception have changed over time. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.020
For example, 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.340
John XXIII requested a Special Commission in favor of permitting abortion 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.349
but Paul VI did not accept it. 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.520
There is no doctrine, whether biblical or dogma of faith, 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.260
that bans the use of contraceptive methods.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.660
80% of the community of believers consulted in 12 countries, including Mexico,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.420
believe that the use of modern contraception methods should be permitted. 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.840
Using these methods is no longer a moral issue.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.380
Is this the talk on contraception?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.360
Yes but nobody came.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680
Can I come in? 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.160
But, Marina... do you not think that you are past the age to...

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.480
Yes, of course. 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.400
I just felt like a tamal.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.875
Me too!
