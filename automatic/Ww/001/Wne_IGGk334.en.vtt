a river cruise is really like yeah the
terrain<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.060> came<00:01:24.600> across<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.110> very

terrain we came across is very

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.719 
terrain we came across is very

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
interesting because we changed

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.080 
interesting because we changed
ecosystems<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.289> were<00:01:28.440> traveling<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.850> went

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
ecosystems as we were traveling it went

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.590 
ecosystems as we were traveling it went
into<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:31.020> dry<00:01:31.640> climate<00:01:32.640> where<00:01:33.300> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
into some very dry climate where you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170 
into some very dry climate where you
know<00:01:33.800> vegetation<00:01:34.800> was<00:01:34.950> scarce<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.030> on

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know vegetation was scarce and then on

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580 
know vegetation was scarce and then on
the<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:36.990> course<00:01:37.229> getting

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the way back here of course getting

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
the way back here of course getting
nearer<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> coast<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> sudden<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
nearer to the coast all of a sudden we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.460 
nearer to the coast all of a sudden we
had<00:01:39.840> Sitka<00:01:40.320> spruce<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.040> big<00:01:41.850> mountains

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
had Sitka spruce and big mountains

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.780 
had Sitka spruce and big mountains
covered<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.619> vegetation<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
covered with vegetation so that's a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.149 
covered with vegetation so that's a
really<00:01:45.060> interesting<00:01:45.350> not<00:01:46.350> only<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.710> travel

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
really interesting not only you travel

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.690 
really interesting not only you travel
in<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:49.020> travel<00:01:49.469> throughout<00:01:49.710> history<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
in time you travel throughout history of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
in time you travel throughout history of
the<00:01:51.149> Columbia<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.200> travel

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the Columbia but you also travel

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
the Columbia but you also travel
throughout<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> older<00:01:53.610> landscape<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
throughout the older landscape which is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
throughout the older landscape which is
really<00:01:54.960> offer<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> great<00:01:56.100> variety<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
really offer a great variety of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.319 
really offer a great variety of
different<00:01:57.540> ecosystems<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.579> also<00:01:59.909> an

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
different ecosystems so that was also an

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.620 
different ecosystems so that was also an
added<00:02:00.899> another<00:02:01.320> layer<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.039> trip<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:03.479> know

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
added another layer to the trip you know

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
added another layer to the trip you know
you're<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.140> jet<00:02:04.439> boat<00:02:04.649> you're<00:02:05.039> not<00:02:05.250> on

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you're not on a jet boat you're not on

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
you're not on a jet boat you're not on
an<00:02:05.549> airplane<00:02:05.909> you're<00:02:06.479> you're<00:02:06.840> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
an airplane you're you're really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
an airplane you're you're really
cruising<00:02:07.890> through<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.340> river<00:02:08.970> deliberately

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
cruising through the river deliberately

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.250 
cruising through the river deliberately
and<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.310> time<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.120> watch<00:02:13.049> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and you have time to kind of watch a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
and you have time to kind of watch a
bird<00:02:13.440> go<00:02:13.739> by<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.850> sail<00:02:15.090> down<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.390> river

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
bird go by as you sail down the river

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.479 
bird go by as you sail down the river
there's<00:02:16.049> something<00:02:16.380> about<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.190> sort<00:02:17.400> of

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
there's something about the the sort of

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.640 
there's something about the the sort of
rhythm<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.000> being<00:02:18.239> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> water<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.930> kind

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
rhythm of being on the water that kind

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.800 
rhythm of being on the water that kind
of<00:02:19.709> gets<00:02:19.920> inside<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.060> relax<00:02:21.570> a
