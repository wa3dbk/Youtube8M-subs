00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.110
 pedagogy in early childhood education to 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.030
 autonomous university style in the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.710
 currently working at saint school

 Maurice of the commune of Cerrillos and 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.980
 I'm in charge of a good kindergarten 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.820
 I select the expected learnings 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.570
 for children between 5 and 6 years old 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.070
 I plan the experiences of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.840
 learning 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.550
 according to its stage of development and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.869
 I also work with parents because 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.520
 not only are the children educated, 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.349
 also he told the families by 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.410
 Now to help us seems 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.399
 a pretty interesting bet in the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.329
 sense of having seen from her a 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.550
 capacity building 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.620
 professional that went beyond the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.489
 specific aspects of their specialty 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.470
 their willingness to train in those 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 professional skills 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.060
 classroom those professional skills 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 which is in relation to the management of 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.980
 environment with all those variables that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.560
 there is a staging with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 subjects 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.220
 of preschool one of the stamps 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.930
 differentiators of our students 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.540
 at the autonomous university of chile 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.060
 it has to do with students who are 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.070
 tremendously responsible with the country and 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 with the society in which they are going 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.050
 touch exercise in the different 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.700
 professions therefore can do 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.370
 tremendously important changes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.590
 always without forgetting that first they are 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.980
 people and that I think is what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.300
 fundamental and the seal that we 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.160
 we implant our students of the day 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.440

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.470

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.820
 super reflective professionals we counted 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500

 the nursery teachers that our 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.030
 country needs

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.850
 I learned in kindergarten and it's a bit 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.530
 synthesizes the importance of this first 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.740
 duty of teaching the way it has been 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.140
