00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
all right I'm going to show you one of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320 
all right I'm going to show you one of
the<00:00:07.620> best<00:00:07.770> ways<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.340> clean<00:00:08.550> out<00:00:08.730> your<00:00:08.880> computer

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the best ways to clean out your computer

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.780 
the best ways to clean out your computer
when<00:00:10.290> your<00:00:10.440> computer<00:00:10.830> fan<00:00:11.070> starts<00:00:11.490> running

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
when your computer fan starts running

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.419 
when your computer fan starts running
all<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> time<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> pop-up<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
all the time or you have a pop-up on the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.660 
all the time or you have a pop-up on the
top<00:00:14.700> bottom<00:00:14.940> right<00:00:15.269> hand<00:00:15.420> corner<00:00:15.570> says<00:00:16.670> over

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
top bottom right hand corner says over

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.109 
top bottom right hand corner says over
usage<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.470> CPU<00:00:19.470> chip<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.939> it's

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
usage of CPU chip it's because it's

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.929 
usage of CPU chip it's because it's
getting<00:00:21.420> hot<00:00:21.769> most<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.980> time<00:00:23.160> anyways<00:00:23.640> because

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
getting hot most of time anyways because

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
getting hot most of time anyways because
it's<00:00:24.210> getting<00:00:24.390> hot<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.470> getting<00:00:25.710> all

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
it's getting hot because of getting all

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's getting hot because of getting all
clogged<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:27.599> dust<00:00:28.340> I'm<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> show

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
clogged up with dust I'm going to show

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.110 
clogged up with dust I'm going to show
you<00:00:30.800> see<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.640> hold<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you see if you can see that hold this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120 
you see if you can see that hold this
camera<00:00:33.600> still<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> don't<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> camera<00:00:34.800> man

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
camera still I don't have a camera man

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.450 
camera still I don't have a camera man
or<00:00:35.399> even<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> nice<00:00:36.210> camera<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
or even a nice camera you see all the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.040 
or even a nice camera you see all the
dust<00:00:41.420> all<00:00:42.420> kinds<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
dust all kinds of it now what you do is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
dust all kinds of it now what you do is
the<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.260> farthest<00:00:46.710> away<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:48.379> there<00:00:49.760> from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the one farthest away from there from

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
the one farthest away from there from
all<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.059> outlets<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.440> them

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
all your outlets because they have them

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
all your outlets because they have them
or<00:00:52.770> hook<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.129> circuit<00:00:53.460> board<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.940> got

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
or hook to your circuit board so you got

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
or hook to your circuit board so you got
to<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> opposite<00:00:55.079> side<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.370> can

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
to go to the opposite side and you can

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.840 
to go to the opposite side and you can
see<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> lever<00:00:57.899> just

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
see on this one it's got a lever just

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.630 
see on this one it's got a lever just
take<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.030> screw<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.449> let's<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.590 

trying<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> show<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.210> here

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.610 

okay<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.720> then<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.900> pull<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.260> lever<00:01:18.470> up

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
okay and then you pull this lever up

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.410 
okay and then you pull this lever up
here<00:01:19.010> pops<00:01:19.550> right<00:01:19.820> up<00:01:19.880> set<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:20.900> over<00:01:21.440> here

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.830 

see<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:27.250> that's<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.369> CPU<00:01:28.850> chip<00:01:29.150> when<00:01:29.690> that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
see that that's a CPU chip when that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.510 
see that that's a CPU chip when that
gets<00:01:30.050> clogged<00:01:30.320> up<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.100> can't<00:01:31.310> cool

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
gets clogged up like that it can't cool

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.790 
gets clogged up like that it can't cool
down<00:01:31.550> that's<00:01:32.210> your<00:01:32.330> heat<00:01:32.540> sink<00:01:32.869> underneath

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
down that's your heat sink underneath

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.740 
down that's your heat sink underneath
that<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.280> your<00:01:34.400> CPU<00:01:34.880> chip<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:35.510> why

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
that is your CPU chip and that's why

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.600 
that is your CPU chip and that's why
it'll<00:01:35.930> get<00:01:36.170> hot<00:01:36.380> if<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.310> don't<00:01:37.490> keep

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
it'll get hot if it if you don't keep

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.830 
it'll get hot if it if you don't keep
them<00:01:37.790> pins<00:01:38.119> cool<00:01:38.510> it'll<00:01:38.840> get<00:01:38.930> real<00:01:39.290> hot

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
them pins cool it'll get real hot

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.359 
them pins cool it'll get real hot
you<00:01:41.840> see<00:01:41.990> there's<00:01:42.229> dust<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.860> back<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.280> it

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
you see there's dust in the back of it

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.960 
you see there's dust in the back of it
there<00:01:44.140> I've<00:01:45.140> had<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.560> worse<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.160> I'd<00:01:46.580> like<00:01:46.820> to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
there I've had it worse but I'd like to

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.219 
there I've had it worse but I'd like to
keep<00:01:47.119> up<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:49.479> all<00:01:50.479> kinds<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:50.960> dust

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
keep up on it all kinds of dust

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.609 
keep up on it all kinds of dust
everywhere

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
everywhere

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.230 
everywhere
another<00:01:54.619> real<00:01:54.890> bad<00:01:55.100> spot<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.640> over<00:01:55.850> here<00:01:56.119> on

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
another real bad spot is over here on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.490 
another real bad spot is over here on
the<00:01:56.360> bottom<00:01:56.539> on<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.200> power<00:01:57.410> supply<00:01:59.289> the<00:02:00.289> error

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the bottom on the power supply the error

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.880 
the bottom on the power supply the error
goes<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.399> back<00:02:05.890> first

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
goes in there and out the back first

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.560 
goes in there and out the back first
thing<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.190> would<00:02:07.310> do<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.789> turn<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> computer

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
thing you would do is turn the computer

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.160 
thing you would do is turn the computer
off<00:02:08.600> completely<00:02:09.610> unplug<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.820> from<00:02:11.330> unplug<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
off completely unplug it from unplug the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.910 
off completely unplug it from unplug the
power<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.810> was<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.930> very<00:02:15.170> good<00:02:15.350> idea<00:02:15.410> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
power and it was a very good idea to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.250 
power and it was a very good idea to
hold<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.519> power<00:02:16.730> button<00:02:16.880> down<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.780> drain

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
hold the power button down to drain

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.440 
hold the power button down to drain
whatever<00:02:18.890> juice<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.640> left<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.299> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
whatever juice there is left in it and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.420 
whatever juice there is left in it and
make<00:02:20.630> sure<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.350> no<00:02:21.560> matter<00:02:21.769> what<00:02:22.070> do<00:02:22.400> not

make sure that no matter what do not

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.940 
make sure that no matter what do not
touch<00:02:22.910> anything<00:02:23.299> inside<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
touch anything inside there and on this

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.460 
touch anything inside there and on this
one<00:02:28.160> here<00:02:28.519> is<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:29.060> very<00:02:29.420> good<00:02:29.630> idea<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.230> not

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
one here is be very good idea do not

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.800 
one here is be very good idea do not
take<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.980> fam<00:02:31.220> off<00:02:31.549> just<00:02:32.030> leave<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.420> like

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
all right this time I got my camera

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.420 
all right this time I got my camera
sitting<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.100> tripod<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:48.070> hold<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> still<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
sitting on a tripod to hold it still I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.720 
sitting on a tripod to hold it still I
suppose<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.060> should<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.239> done<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.510> earlier

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
suppose I should have done that earlier

suppose I should have done that earlier
all<00:02:52.730> right<00:02:53.320> here's<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.410> best<00:02:54.739> way<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
all right here's the best way to do it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.060 
all right here's the best way to do it
that<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.820> with<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.450> leaf<00:02:56.720> blower<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.680> got<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:57.980> be

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
that is with a leaf blower you got to be

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.590 
that is with a leaf blower you got to be
careful<00:02:58.340> though<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> real<00:02:59.480> strong

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
careful though if you have a real strong

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720 
careful though if you have a real strong
one<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.049> will<00:03:00.140> pull<00:03:00.590> your<00:03:00.769> computer<00:03:01.310> all<00:03:01.459> over

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
one it will pull your computer all over

00:03:01.730 --> 00:04:31.659 
one it will pull your computer all over
the<00:03:01.820> place<00:03:02.380> all<00:03:03.380> right<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:03.950> go

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.300 

that's<00:04:32.669> how<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:32.909> do<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:34.220> much<00:04:35.220> much<00:04:35.460> cleaner<00:04:35.789> I

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
that's how you do it much much cleaner I

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.260 
that's how you do it much much cleaner I
don't<00:04:38.310> know<00:04:38.370> if<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.699> see<00:04:38.909> it<00:04:39.030> there

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
don't know if you can see it there

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.570 
don't know if you can see it there
you're<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:42.590> little<00:04:43.590> bit<00:04:43.710> too<00:04:43.889> much<00:04:44.069> Sun<00:04:44.370> on

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
you're a little bit too much Sun on

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.960 
you're a little bit too much Sun on
there<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:45.470> might<00:04:46.470> bring<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.800> inside<00:04:46.949> there<00:04:47.550> you

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.800 

take<00:04:50.970> another<00:04:51.240> look<00:04:51.449> at<00:04:51.629> it<00:04:51.659> now<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:51.930> after

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
take another look at it now the after

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.570 
take another look at it now the after
much<00:04:54.810> much<00:04:55.259> cleaner<00:04:58.280> remember<00:04:59.280> what<00:04:59.430> that

all clean inside they're all up in there
really<00:05:14.250> does<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> good<00:05:14.849> job<00:05:15.440> here's<00:05:16.440> what<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
really does a good job here's what the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.420 
really does a good job here's what the
