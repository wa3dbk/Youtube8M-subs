00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.310
 hello youtube hello to subscribers and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:25.380
 Viewers channel technics reviews today 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 I want to talk about how can mature 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.950
 question in the creation of the power supply 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.129
 universal why because i often 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.840
 making some 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.239
 homemade some electric 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.450
 devices that need to be connected 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.789
 even here is the last thing that I show 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 this making 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.180
 table rotating and it needs to be given 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.250
 power 3 volts which in general 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 take none of except two there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 batteries but you still need to do them 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.519
 its this body or something else so I 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.210
 decided to take one of his 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.430
 old computer power supplies 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 which are in working condition and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:22.100
 make it for yourself 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.750
 laboratory power supply 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.409
 What are the characteristics of the power supply? 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.650
 computer computer unit 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:38.610
 power the following characteristics is 3 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:42.990
 volts plus 5 minus 5 plus 12 minus 12 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.689
 Volt is what he gives plus 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.180
 There is a possibility of starting, that is, if 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.070
 take this green one 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.500
 and black wire to close the power supply 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.770
 runs without maternal presence 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.440
 boards and computer cases therefore 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.240
 I decided on this question 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 that such a power supply is quite possible 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.520
 use for your desktops 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.390
 homemade for their power to check 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.250
 for testing, that's the only thing 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090
 I want to say that the power supply is not 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.900
 intended to stay on without 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.780
 load i.e. it should be considered 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.270
 but from practice I can say that earlier 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.540
 already used in certain 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.630
 experiments such a power supply he 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.970
 switched on without order load on 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.250
 one and a half two hours and nothing with him 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.190
 happened that is in general that can be 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.260
 if switching on without load will be more 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.950
 long the power supply can 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
 get injured 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.709
 but no less such a recommendation 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:00.049
 another requirement should be considered 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.570
 I myself put it in front of him 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:09.220
 the fact that you this power supply was not 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.720
 let's say so spoiled and lera is manned 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.769
 so that it becomes unsuitable for 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.810
 use it for its intended purpose in 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:26.230
 so the computer was taken 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:30.340
 connector from a faulty power supply 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.440
 here I plan to put 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.500
 transient rods and such 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.690
 way to connect this plug 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.269
 continue to connect the necessary wires 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.460
 to those cream from which already feed 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.480
 their devices such as a well or 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.310
 I prepared it like this 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.720
 laboratory terminals on which you can and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.000
 clamp the wire and insert the plug into 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.450
 inside this heart cell will 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.090
 located on this electric 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.420
 planochki plastic that is here 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.420
 will be installed this way 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.800
 Terminals well naturally fixed 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:35.260
 show just to 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:38.950
 show like this and now show more here 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.730
 these two little two little 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:47.320
 nest 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:51.780
 they will be installed here in these 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.900
 holes and will fulfill the role 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.590
 circuit breaker 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.320
 that is, just a shelf there are violinists 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.050
 will be inserted here to close these 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.280
 contacts and so will 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.510
 start a blog 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:16.870
 I plan to mount it on such 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:24.310
 racks now, too, I will show that here 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:28.660
 in such a way fasten on racks and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.310
 fasten here on the power supply ie 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.220
 on the power supply only needed 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.590
 drill two holes for this taken 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.260
 again here's a lid not a barrel block 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.850
 the power supply of these holes is already just that is 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.580
 this option will be fixed 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.510
 the bar if necessary to return the block 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.510
 power supply 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.880
 you top state when it can be 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:57.310
 computer used is enough 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:01.060
 will remove this part here to install 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.040
 full-time in place and disconnect this one 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.720
 connector ie power supply connector 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.620
 can be used to connect to 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.280
 motherboard 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.190
 and the whole block, that is, such a concept 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.860
 designed me now i want 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.500
 bring it to life 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.910
 in the following way in 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:28.320
 first i need this power supply 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:32.230
 install install all terminals 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:35.500
 connect this connector to this cream 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:39.730
 and prepare here 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.030
 pins on which the connector will be assembled 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.850
 there is something that I will try to 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.130
 I will work without a camera in the future 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.130
 show I specifically dedicated time 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.590
 to tell and pre 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.080
 indicators it will look for 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:01.260
 to make my next video clear 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:06.930
 what and how I do and what and how is going on 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.930
 bye for now
