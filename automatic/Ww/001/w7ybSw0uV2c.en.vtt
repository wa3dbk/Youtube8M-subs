00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
button up a little bit make it easier to
hit<00:01:39.500> I've<00:01:40.500> decided<00:01:40.860> however<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.490> no

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
hit I've decided however that I'm no

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.889 
hit I've decided however that I'm no
longer<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.240> using<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.659> because

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
longer going to be using them because

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
longer going to be using them because
they<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.049> rather<00:01:43.380> difficult<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.159> remove<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
they are rather difficult to remove not

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
they are rather difficult to remove not
impossible<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.829> took<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.280> 10

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
impossible but you know took me about 10

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.060 
impossible but you know took me about 10
minutes<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.090> remove<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.829> phone

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
minutes to remove my one from my phone

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
minutes to remove my one from my phone
so<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.460> probably<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> ahead

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so I'm probably not going to go ahead

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
so I'm probably not going to go ahead
and<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.680> again<00:01:52.950> any<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:53.670> soon<00:01:53.880> you're

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and use them again any time soon you're

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
and use them again any time soon you're
also<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.590> microfiber

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
on and that is pretty much it but I'll

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.750 
on and that is pretty much it but I'll
