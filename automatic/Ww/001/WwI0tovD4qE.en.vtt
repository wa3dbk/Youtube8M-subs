00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
recommended this I'm trying to remember

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170 
recommended this I'm trying to remember
but<00:01:19.040> somebody<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.340> YouTube<00:01:20.640> recommended

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but somebody here on YouTube recommended

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
but somebody here on YouTube recommended
this<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.930> she<00:01:22.140> does<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this and that's what she does with it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
this and that's what she does with it
I<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.490> been<00:01:23.670> using<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.780> straight

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I have been using it as a straight

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.340 
I have been using it as a straight
primer<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
primer and I really really like it it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
primer and I really really like it it
adds<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.630> stickiness<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.990> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
adds a little bit of stickiness to your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
adds a little bit of stickiness to your
skin<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.060> grabs<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> hold

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
skin so it really kind of grabs a hold

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
skin so it really kind of grabs a hold
of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> foundation<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> nano

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of the foundation but not like the nano

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.280 
of the foundation but not like the nano
blur<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> nano<00:01:35.970> blur<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.630> glue<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
blur the nano blur was like glue and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
blur the nano blur was like glue and
didn't<00:01:38.040> allow<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.610> foundation<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> really

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
didn't allow your foundation to really

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.740 
didn't allow your foundation to really
blend<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.220> does<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.210> much

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
blend out over it this does this is much

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
blend out over it this does this is much
easier<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> work<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.979> also<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
easier to work with but it also kind of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
easier to work with but it also kind of
grabs<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.000> hold<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.479> after<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.350> done

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
grabs a hold of it after you're done

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649 
grabs a hold of it after you're done
blending<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.729> helps<00:01:48.210> keep<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
blending it out and really helps keep it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.920 
blending it out and really helps keep it
in<00:01:48.780> place<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.350> day<00:01:49.500> long<00:01:49.850> I've<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:50.930> pairing

complexion<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.549> wanted<00:01:56.850> something

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
complexion because I wanted something

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
complexion because I wanted something
sheer<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.350> over<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.939> allow

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
sheer to go over this that will allow

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
sheer to go over this that will allow
some<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.899> luminosity<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.860> show<00:02:02.040> through

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
some of that luminosity to show through

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
some of that luminosity to show through
and<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.439> think

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and this is a good one for that I think

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.880 
and this is a good one for that I think
the<00:02:05.340> two<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:05.939> together<00:02:06.469> create<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> very

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the two of these together create a very

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.660 
the two of these together create a very
nice<00:02:08.250> glowing<00:02:09.000> look<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.869> beautiful

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
nice glowing look that is very beautiful

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.730 
nice glowing look that is very beautiful
I've<00:02:11.670> paired<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
I've paired it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.070 
I've paired it
because<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.280> wanted<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> review<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.840> my

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
because I wanted to do a review with my

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.360 
because I wanted to do a review with my
Neutrogena<00:02:15.820> Glo<00:02:16.820> shears<00:02:17.290> Foundation<00:02:18.290> which<00:02:19.100> I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
Neutrogena Glo shears Foundation which I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.700 
Neutrogena Glo shears Foundation which I
actually<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.210> pairing<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.410> may<00:02:21.680> be

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
actually like the pairing but it may be

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.520 
actually like the pairing but it may be
too<00:02:22.040> much<00:02:22.070> for<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.790> people<00:02:23.360> who<00:02:23.570> because

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
too much for some people who because

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.530 
too much for some people who because
this<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.980> luminous<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:26.030> luminous

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
this is luminous and this is luminous

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.830 
this is luminous and this is luminous
and<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:28.070> may<00:02:28.280> end<00:02:28.520> up<00:02:28.580> looking<00:02:28.760> too<00:02:29.210> shiny<00:02:29.540> I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and you may end up looking too shiny I

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.560 
and you may end up looking too shiny I
did<00:02:30.590> put<00:02:30.920> powder<00:02:31.190> over<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.060> cut<00:02:32.360> down<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
did put powder over it to cut down a

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.590 
did put powder over it to cut down a
little<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> shine<00:02:33.650> um<00:02:34.520> but<00:02:35.180> like<00:02:35.450> I

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
little bit on the shine um but like I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.020 
little bit on the shine um but like I
said<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.500> paired<00:02:36.920> best<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.700> like

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
said I think it's paired best with like

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.120 
said I think it's paired best with like
a<00:02:38.210> sheer<00:02:38.540> foundation<00:02:38.990> if<00:02:39.680> you're<00:02:39.800> gonna<00:02:39.920> wear

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
a sheer foundation if you're gonna wear

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.310 
a sheer foundation if you're gonna wear
something<00:02:40.580> full<00:02:40.790> coverage<00:02:41.150> you're<00:02:41.990> going<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
something full coverage you're going to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200 
something full coverage you're going to
lose<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.710> luminosity<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.790> adds<00:02:43.970> just

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
lose the luminosity that this adds just

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.960 
lose the luminosity that this adds just
because<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.290> cover<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.710> up<00:02:45.880> um<00:02:46.880> I

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
because it's going to cover it up um I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.470 
because it's going to cover it up um I
did<00:02:47.630> pair<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.140> my<00:02:48.380> Laura<00:02:48.650> Mercier<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.550> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
did pair it with my Laura Mercier and it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.840 
did pair it with my Laura Mercier and it
helped<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.930> last<00:02:51.200> longer<00:02:51.770> because<00:02:52.250> that's<00:02:52.610> not

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
helped it last longer because that's not

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.180 
helped it last longer because that's not
a<00:02:52.910> very<00:02:53.180> long<00:02:53.630> lasting<00:02:53.870> foundation<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.920> begin

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
a very long lasting foundation to begin

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
a very long lasting foundation to begin
with<00:02:55.690> but<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.930> like<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.500> best<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.840> Revlon

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
with but I like it best with that Revlon

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.940 
with but I like it best with that Revlon
now<00:03:01.010> we'll<00:03:01.160> go<00:03:01.310> ahead<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.850> pump<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.600> out<00:03:02.950> it's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
now we'll go ahead and pump it out it's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.560 
now we'll go ahead and pump it out it's
kind<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:05.350> bronzy<00:03:06.350> color<00:03:07.330> right<00:03:08.330> there

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
kind of like a bronzy color right there

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.660 
kind of like a bronzy color right there
and<00:03:08.780> when<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:09.140> blend<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.590> out<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:09.740> just<00:03:10.040> blends

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
and when you blend it out it just blends

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
and when you blend it out it just blends
out<00:03:10.910> kind<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.450> Sheeran<00:03:11.960> nicely<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.890> adds<00:03:13.250> a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
out kind of Sheeran nicely and adds a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.140 
out kind of Sheeran nicely and adds a
nice<00:03:15.170> luminous<00:03:16.040> finish<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:18.230> your<00:03:18.350> skin<00:03:19.150> it's

very very pretty

um one thing you do want to be aware of
if<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.660> don't<00:03:29.870> blend<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.320> out<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:31.010> collect

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
if you don't blend it out it can collect

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.370 
if you don't blend it out it can collect
like<00:03:31.940> around<00:03:32.300> your<00:03:32.420> eyebrow<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.020> you<00:03:33.200> have

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
like kind of a brownish tinge there so

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.500 
like kind of a brownish tinge there so
you<00:03:36.500> really<00:03:36.890> want<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.160> make<00:03:37.340> sure<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:38.330> you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you really want to make sure that you

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.330 
you really want to make sure that you
blend<00:03:38.840> out<00:03:39.080> areas<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.920> know<00:03:40.010> by<00:03:40.190> your

blend out areas you know by your

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.460 
blend out areas you know by your
hairline<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.300> doesn't<00:03:41.600> really<00:03:41.690> collect<00:03:42.260> in

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
hairline so it doesn't really collect in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.530 
hairline so it doesn't really collect in
those<00:03:42.620> areas<00:03:43.040> because<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.670> was<00:03:44.060> at<00:03:44.180> work<00:03:44.360> one

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
those areas because I was at work one

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.420 
those areas because I was at work one
day<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.960> I<00:03:45.050> after<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.470> heard<00:03:45.830> Lee<00:03:46.070> did<00:03:46.280> my

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
day and I after I heard Lee did my

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.920 
day and I after I heard Lee did my
makeup<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.880> was<00:03:46.970> running<00:03:47.270> late<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.660> looked

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
makeup I was running late and I looked

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.460 
makeup I was running late and I looked
and<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.260> saw<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.710> this<00:03:48.890> brown<00:03:49.330> streak<00:03:50.470> right

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470

here like right above my eyebrow and it
was<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.230> because<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:55.610> was<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.810> kind<00:03:57.290> of

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
was this because it was it kind of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.620 
was this because it was it kind of
collected<00:03:58.100> there<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.550> looked<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.540> little

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
collected there and looked a little

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.690 
collected there and looked a little
strange<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.620> do<00:04:01.010> want<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> be<00:04:01.400> aware<00:04:01.640> of

strange so you do want to be aware of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.030 
strange so you do want to be aware of
that<00:04:02.030> but<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.110> said<00:04:03.170> it's<00:04:03.560> it's<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.010> very

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
that but like I said it's it's a very

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.020 
that but like I said it's it's a very
pretty<00:04:04.700> primer<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.600> it's<00:04:05.960> somewhat<00:04:06.560> sticky

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
pretty primer and it's somewhat sticky

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.480
