00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.889
 good this time is going to continue fighting from the sexiest in the world 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.329
 before the time to take into account in case of injury between some 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.189
 difficulties not in vain 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.150
 the three have waited so long for Alexander the Great 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.560
 when this is because many times a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.009
 as for the applications with which it starts comma 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.029
 and good to start let's see what a system that goes with the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.659
 tobacco 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.870
 we look for we wish teachers of the system then we go 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.670
 directly the most anticipated of the year 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.680
 of counts 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.250
 and here in account let's shut up 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.420
 once retired savage except for the court 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.680
 We are looking for 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.460
 here they arrive 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.970
 the airline workers pointed out that he hoped that we are going to 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.540
 change 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.760
 that one so every part 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.360
 pickets we want is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.720
 it accelerates 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.850
 I'm not a good winner I already did it I already have time I did it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990
 irma simply jesÃºs two treasures that we are what 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.860
 the tucu because they always appear with put the washing machine 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.250
 but it is simple simply if you want to remove them simply 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.130
 simply bonus you select indications that in this icon of less 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.830
 There you get the legend to eliminate the item by item selected as 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 I think this is not in this guy in our power but I'm looking forward 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.510
 I hope they help us and it's late 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.840
 what that ghalib the problem of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.220
 Meanwhile 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 with some computers that hesitate 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 too many times in the fanfare 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.390
 against this one 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.700
 I detest the trick 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 and if the truth of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 it is very fast very fast 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.310
 at the start the heat won now that the Kenyan 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 is that way 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.310
