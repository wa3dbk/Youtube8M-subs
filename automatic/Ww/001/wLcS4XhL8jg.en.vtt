00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.970
 the poetry books and the novels photos 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.970
 planets that rain that move 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.990
 Oh what way they are and I hope they are 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.700
 very well welcome to a video of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.009
 gt5 today I come to talk about 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.599
 several things first of all as you know 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.090
 we are nothing of bank robberies 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.950
 you know that suddenly we are there in your 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.989
 boring house watching TV playing 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.750
 xbox and dices hey I'm going for a soda 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.059
 good to realize that this is how you are 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.880
 in gta and walking boring you say or was 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.590
 for some robberies then good no no 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.750
 he says he is very pure and it is not something else but 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.180
 you say he's going to get robbery I'm going to play 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.370
 robberies to banks good nobody says that I 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.800
 I'm weird but I say it so I 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.600
 like to imagine that everyone says that way 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.000
 that's why I say that everything you say already 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.890
 straight to the point because if I do not start 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.470
 talk about other things bank robberies 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.500
 it's nothing that comes out I'll be 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.329
 playing with you on xbox 360 first 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
 that nothing will I record in xbox one and 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.710
 all those things to teach them the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 hogs give them tips to raise games 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.430
 and those things that I like that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 you like them I suppose that of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.630
 suddenly you play gta iv maybe you'll 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.590
 like to play with me someday on xbox 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.079
 360 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.579
 if you do not have xbox 360 I'm sorry I do not 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.950
 I have many play tell me hey 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.960
 but if I was saying I was 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.969
 saying I do not remember that many 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.460
 they say play in play but I do not have 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.310
 play the same later I buy a play 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.140
 station 3 or a play 4 to play with 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.030
 everyone who has play only that 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.640
 the moment does not seem so 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.619
 besides, it's complicated to be changing 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.390
 of control console that connect this 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.740
 cable that project it here that there already 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.420
 I'm recording there now I want to record 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.090
 in xbox already and with that is a desmadre 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 I prefer to stay with the 360 ​​and with the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.959
 one then at this point the only thing 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.390
 I wanted to tell you is that I will be 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.630
 playing bank robberies in walt and in 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.880
 360 I really do not have any hours or 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.709
 it is not that there are 6 to 7 I am going to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.869
 play simply when I go 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.719
 connected I'm playing on xbox 360 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.899
 Send me messages to invite them 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.310
 and if I'm playing to record or something 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.620
 well or just if I'm playing 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 bank robberies I will invite you to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.730
 let's play some games or something and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.920
 also that I'll upload it to the channel 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.810
 games with subscribers or simply 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.519
 passing robberies to banks but that 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.569
 you are there accompanying me 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.400
 help lift 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.889
 I think you like money to 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.889
 I like money 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:32.540
 hey hey this is a bank i come 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.790
 stealing that's what we're going to say 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.499
 together and if not I will not say this 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.599
 first I tell them that I'm going to record and 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.879
 of bank robberies is apparent 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.400
 another thing that is the new era that is 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.370
 comes to gta 5 that more than anything is for 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.680
 comment it to share my happiness 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.659
 know that gta 5 has been stagnant not 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.969
 in the fact that it is boring or anything 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.680
 but many people let him play or 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.379
 many people no longer play it so often 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.639
 because it is very repetitive because 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.159
 there is nothing new 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.379
 including me I record game some 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.469
 games and in exchange for game or I see 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.079
 netflix or change of bastard thing I'm going to 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.150
 read a book see for us more things 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.430
 interesting since you get bored of playing 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.079
 the same and that there is nothing new you just finish 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.090
 doing other things or you end up playing 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.370
 other things or you end up not playing anymore 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.829
 so much time and this from the robberies to 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.169
 banks will bring something very beautiful of 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.849
 new to the community to youtube a lot 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.949
 people who had stopped playing goes to 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.870
 come back now what it looks like is that 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.290
 rockstar is going to take more desire to the jeta 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.140
 on-line 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.180
 then we have the gta for pc and how 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.829
 a long time ago I said in a video I do not know 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.870
 if they saw it in and I remember which one 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.159
 but I remember that I once said it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.170
 I know if it was on youtube or it was in a 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.000
 conversation with another youtube or was 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 just in the night when I speak 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.650
 it's just not kidding I do not speak alone but it's 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.530
 That's when when I start thinking 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.299
 gta 5 I think it's going to be a game of 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.129
 those that there's always going to be something new 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.769
 that will last a long time that is going to 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.810
 have updates that will be made 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.760
 as minecraft nobel minecraft always 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.609
 has version 1.8 updates 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.790
 point 2 what version 1.8 point 4 what 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.980
 version 1.6 point 6.6 x I do not think that 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.450
 will happen with the gta 5 since they leave 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.370
 bank robberies 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.799
 rockstar take a long time to do things 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.780
 but undoubtedly some do them well and 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.489
 I think that is preferable, imagine that 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.650
 you hire an architect to do 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.139
 your house and it makes you all horrible in 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.750
 a week or instead you hire 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.030
 rockstar makes you home in two years 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.130
 but it makes you very beautiful with posters 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.930
 of gta 5 and the whole thing the new 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.940
 game updates look 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.470
 promising I think they are going to put 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.000
 daily challenges 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.310
 start putting new things in the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.130
 online then it is already saying that they are going 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.320
 to draw a dlc in individual mode or 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.450
 a little more campaign that's still not 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.820
 Sure it's a rumor but what I'm going 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.160
 that is already starting to get cuter this 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.530
 issue of gta 5 and this video was for 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.170
 comment those two points comes a 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.420
 new era for big cars and it's coming 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.160
 a new era for the director of 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.230
 events leave your like if you're 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.030
 excited about that of the holdups by the 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.220
 new era that will follow the community 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.140
 big guideline and subscribe if you have not 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.540
 subscribed so that all my 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.540
 videos see you later goodbye
