so<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.279> keep<00:00:05.460> hearing<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:05.970> North<00:00:06.390> Korea's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
so we keep hearing about North Korea's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.960 
so we keep hearing about North Korea's
weapons<00:00:07.340> capabilities<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.610> thought<00:00:08.820> it's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
weapons capabilities but we thought it's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.299 
weapons capabilities but we thought it's
a<00:00:09.030> bit<00:00:09.330> unclear<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.530> kind<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> missiles

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309

within range accuracies North we also

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.710 
within range accuracies North we also

lucid I'm in the West it's been seen in
military<00:01:20.289> parades<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.860> North<00:01:21.070> Korea<00:01:21.310> has

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
military parades that North Korea has

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
military parades that North Korea has
done<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.119> from<00:01:22.539> that<00:01:22.720> people<00:01:22.960> sort<00:01:23.289> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
done and from that people sort of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.319 
done and from that people sort of
speculated<00:01:24.009> what<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.250> capability<00:01:24.939> with<00:01:25.090> being

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
speculated what is capability with being

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.789 
speculated what is capability with being
depending<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.079> what<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.320> think<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
depending on what you think the

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.340 
depending on what you think the
technology<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.759> missile<00:01:28.119> uses<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:29.079> could

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
technology that missile uses is it could

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.230 
technology that missile uses is it could
probably<00:01:29.619> get<00:01:30.039> up<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> range<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.909> about

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
probably get up to a range of about

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.870 
probably get up to a range of about
3,000<00:01:31.990> kilometers<00:01:32.530> which<00:01:32.979> gets<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.429> close<00:01:33.579> to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
3,000 kilometers which gets it close to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.639 
3,000 kilometers which gets it close to
Guam<00:01:34.119> but<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.869> doesn't<00:01:35.200> look<00:01:35.289> like<00:01:35.350> would

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
Guam but that doesn't look like would

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.809 
Guam but that doesn't look like would
actually<00:01:35.979> be<00:01:36.100> able<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.369> get<00:01:36.490> along<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.700> other

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
actually be able to get along the other

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.969 
actually be able to get along the other
one<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.299> is<00:01:40.600> what's<00:01:41.229> called<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> tape<00:01:41.740> put<00:01:41.860> on

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
one is is what's called the tape put on

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.950 
one is is what's called the tape put on
to<00:01:42.280> which<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> ballistic<00:01:43.450> missile<00:01:43.479> that's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
to which is a ballistic missile that's

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.380 
to which is a ballistic missile that's
thought<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.619> be<00:01:44.860> based<00:01:45.069> on<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.880> North<00:01:46.090> Korean

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
thought to be based on the North Korean

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.059 
thought to be based on the North Korean
space<00:01:46.630> launch<00:01:46.959> vehicle<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:47.560> they<00:01:47.709> launched

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
space launch vehicle that they launched

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.370 
space launch vehicle that they launched
satellite<00:01:48.549> with<00:01:48.729> in<00:01:48.939> December<00:01:49.509> we<00:01:49.990> have<00:01:50.200> not

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
satellite with in December we have not

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.929 
satellite with in December we have not
seen<00:01:50.649> tests<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.189> that<00:01:51.369> missile<00:01:51.759> as<00:01:51.909> a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
seen tests of that missile as a

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.639 
seen tests of that missile as a
ballistic<00:01:52.479> missile<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:53.049> seems<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.380> me<00:01:53.470> they're

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
ballistic missile it seems to me they're

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.260 
ballistic missile it seems to me they're
very<00:01:53.830> unlikely<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.340> try<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.789> put<00:01:55.000> one<00:01:55.179> of

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
very unlikely to try and put one of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
very unlikely to try and put one of
their<00:01:55.390> few<00:01:55.569> nuclear<00:01:55.929> weapons<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.439> top<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.860> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
their few nuclear weapons on top of it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.649 
their few nuclear weapons on top of it
and<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.610> don't<00:01:57.759> think<00:01:57.880> based<00:01:58.330> on<00:01:58.539> the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
and I just don't think based on the

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.690
