00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it's called the sustain pedal on a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.160 
it's called the sustain pedal on a
keyboard<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:41.280> only<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.579> petal<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
keyboard there's only one petal on a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
keyboard there's only one petal on a
piano<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.010> usually<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.000> they

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
piano there are usually three and they

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.209 
piano there are usually three and they
do<00:00:45.149> different<00:00:45.629> things<00:00:45.690> there's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> pedal<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
do different things there's a pedal that

do different things there's a pedal that
makes<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.120> sound<00:00:48.329> softer<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
makes it the sound softer that kind of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
makes it the sound softer that kind of
dampens<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> keys<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> main<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.329> we're

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
dampens the keys but the main one we're

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
dampens the keys but the main one we're
going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> talk<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.039> sustain

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
going to talk about is this the sustain

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.840 
going to talk about is this the sustain
pedal<00:00:54.800> try<00:00:55.800> saying<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.250> sustain<00:00:56.699> pedal

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
pedal try saying that sustain pedal

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
pedal try saying that sustain pedal
sustainment<00:00:57.449> tongue<00:00:57.840> twister<00:00:58.170> ok<00:00:58.680> three

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
sustainment tongue twister ok three

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
sustainment tongue twister ok three
times<00:00:59.160> fast<00:00:59.430> sustain<00:00:59.969> pedal<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> same

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
times fast sustain pedal it's the same

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390 
times fast sustain pedal it's the same
ok<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.910> hit<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> sustain<00:01:03.629> pedal<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.400> when

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
ok so you hit the sustain pedal and when

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.859 
ok so you hit the sustain pedal and when
you<00:01:05.489> push<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> stop<00:01:06.390> playing<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> note

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you push it and stop playing the note

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
you push it and stop playing the note
i'm<00:01:07.080> still<00:01:07.619> holding<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> pedal<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
i'm still holding the pedal down the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
i'm still holding the pedal down the
note<00:01:08.939> holds<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.390> ok<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.229> let's<00:01:10.979> say<00:01:11.189> you're

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
note holds up ok so let's say you're

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.679 
note holds up ok so let's say you're
doing<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.640> chord<00:01:11.909> progression<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:12.540> say

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
doing a chord progression let's say

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.010 
doing a chord progression let's say
you're<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.750> then<00:01:15.750> g

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
you're doing see and then g

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.760 
you're doing see and then g
and<00:01:17.140> then<00:01:17.979> F<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:19.179> back<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.509> see<00:01:19.689> all<00:01:20.259> right<00:01:20.469> so

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
and then F and back to see all right so

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.679 
and then F and back to see all right so
what<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.159> would<00:01:21.280> do<00:01:21.520> if<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:21.820> just<00:01:22.270> had<00:01:22.509> no

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
what you would do if you just had no

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.580 
what you would do if you just had no
pedal<00:01:23.049> would<00:01:23.170> sound<00:01:23.320> like<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:27.960> okay<00:01:28.960> kind<00:01:29.500> of

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
pedal would sound like this okay kind of

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.889 
pedal would sound like this okay kind of
boring<00:01:29.799> but<00:01:30.579> if<00:01:30.819> you<00:01:31.060> want<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.479> press<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
boring but if you want to press the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:41.810 
boring but if you want to press the
pedal<00:01:32.170> down

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.429 

okay<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.909> just<00:01:42.969> holds<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.810> notes<00:01:44.020> out<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
okay it just holds the notes out and

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.109 
okay it just holds the notes out and
makes<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.710> all<00:01:44.799> sound<00:01:44.979> more<00:01:45.219> connected<00:01:45.670> what

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
makes it all sound more connected what

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.630 
makes it all sound more connected what
you<00:01:46.210> don't<00:01:46.539> want<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.140> do<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.619> hold<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.429> pedal

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you don't want to do is hold the pedal

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:58.460 
you don't want to do is hold the pedal
down<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.969> whole<00:01:49.240> time<00:01:49.509> so<00:01:50.380> see

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.070 

see<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.920> all<00:02:00.340> starts<00:02:00.940> runnin<00:02:01.270> together<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.630> at

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
see it all starts runnin together so at

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.350 
see it all starts runnin together so at
each<00:02:02.350> different<00:02:02.740> chord<00:02:03.250> change<00:02:03.610> you're<00:02:04.180> going

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
each different chord change you're going

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.030 
each different chord change you're going
to<00:02:04.420> pick<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.780> up<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.080> then<00:02:05.410> set<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.800> back<00:02:05.980> down

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
to pick it up and then set it back down

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.590 
to pick it up and then set it back down
okay<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.060> see<00:02:08.970> pick<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> up<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.330> put<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.479> back

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600
