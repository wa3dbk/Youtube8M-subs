time how do we miss you but for most of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.260 
time how do we miss you but for most of
the<00:04:30.100> movie<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> know<00:04:30.460> exactly<00:04:30.940> what<00:04:31.090> was<00:04:31.150> going

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
the movie I know exactly what was going

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.180 
the movie I know exactly what was going
to<00:04:31.330> happen<00:04:31.390> nothing<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.500> surprised<00:04:32.979> me

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
to happen nothing really surprised me

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.870 
to happen nothing really surprised me
and<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:34.419> just<00:04:34.450> hit<00:04:35.020> all<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.470> beats<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.160> movie

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
and it just hit all the beats that movie

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.730 
and it just hit all the beats that movie
like<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:37.180> tends<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.080> hit<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.530> didn't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
like this tends to hit and it didn't

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.010 
like this tends to hit and it didn't
really<00:04:38.830> go<00:04:38.950> anywhere<00:04:39.250> into<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.630> pool<00:04:40.840> of

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
really go anywhere into the the pool of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.050 
really go anywhere into the the pool of
unpredictability<00:04:41.700> unfortunately<00:04:42.700> but<00:04:42.790> still

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
unpredictability unfortunately but still

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.120 
unpredictability unfortunately but still
in<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> end<00:04:43.479> 21<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.020> over<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.470> actually

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
in the end 21 and over it actually

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.650 
in the end 21 and over it actually
exceeded<00:04:45.790> my<00:04:45.850> expectation<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.419> it<00:04:46.479> really

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
exceeded my expectation that it really

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.969 
exceeded my expectation that it really
expected<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.200> hilarious<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:47.860> thought

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
expected to be hilarious it just thought

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.920 
expected to be hilarious it just thought
it<00:04:48.039> would<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.250> good<00:04:48.430> time<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:49.180> really

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
it would be a good time but I really

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.200 
it would be a good time but I really
enjoyed<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.349> movie<00:04:50.500> had<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.460> lot<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.700> laughs<00:04:52.000> I
