blowing out cool to cold air out of the
vents<00:00:14.839> the<00:00:15.839> suction<00:00:16.619> side<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:18.029> know

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
vents the suction side is you know

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.560 
vents the suction side is you know
getting<00:00:18.449> sweaty<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.880> not<00:00:21.060> cool<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
getting sweaty but it's not cool in the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.529 
getting sweaty but it's not cool in the
car<00:00:21.779> down<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.439> pulling<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.910> it's

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
car down it's not pulling you know it's

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.120 
car down it's not pulling you know it's
not<00:00:24.660> pulling<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> humidity<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> pulling

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
not pulling the humidity out and pulling

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.269 
not pulling the humidity out and pulling
a<00:00:26.310> temperature<00:00:26.820> down<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.590> checked<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
a temperature down and I have checked I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.179 
a temperature down and I have checked I
mean<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.539> heater<00:00:31.019> core<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.679> shutting

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
mean it's the heater core is shutting

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.319 
mean it's the heater core is shutting
off<00:00:33.950> it's<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.160> blowing<00:00:35.460> heat<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> same

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
off it's not blowing heat at the same

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.299 
off it's not blowing heat at the same
time<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.110> that's<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.190> issue

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
time so that's that's not an issue

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
time so that's that's not an issue
that's<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> first<00:00:39.090> things<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.450> checked

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that's one of the first things I checked

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.720 
that's one of the first things I checked
but<00:00:40.760> from<00:00:41.760> last<00:00:42.030> year<00:00:43.309> see<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
but from last year see if I can get a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.170 
but from last year see if I can get a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
anyhow you'll have to take my word for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
anyhow you'll have to take my word for
right<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:05.670> finger<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.390> where

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
right here where my finger is is where

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.960 
right here where my finger is is where
the<00:01:07.280> high<00:01:08.280> pressure<00:01:08.549> line<00:01:08.939> bolts<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
the high pressure line bolts to the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.200 
the high pressure line bolts to the
condenser<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.420> last<00:01:13.350> year<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:14.180> when<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
condenser and last year there's when I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
condenser and last year there's when I
checked<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> small<00:01:16.380> leak<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
checked that there is a small leak you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
checked that there is a small leak you
can<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.400> dye<00:01:17.610> coming<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.210> around<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
can see some dye coming out around it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.520 
can see some dye coming out around it
and<00:01:22.729> seems<00:01:23.729> ok<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.509> we'll<00:01:24.840> find<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.259> I'm

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and seems ok now but we'll find out I'm

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.990 
and seems ok now but we'll find out I'm
going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:25.890> gauges<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> see

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
going to put some gauges on if you see

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to put some gauges on if you see
what<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> pressures<00:01:29.570> okay<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> gauges

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
what the pressures okay I got the gauges

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.700 
what the pressures okay I got the gauges
hooked<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:32.420> keep<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> mind<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.960> system<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
hooked up keep in mind this system you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.859 
hooked up keep in mind this system you
can<00:01:34.890> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> read<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> gauge<00:01:35.729> air<00:01:36.030> zoom<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
can kind of read the gauge air zoom is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.679 
can kind of read the gauge air zoom is

pound and as last year it did have a
pound<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> pressure

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
pound in it but right now the pressure

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
pound in it but right now the pressure

thanks to the die by wire throttle
system<00:04:44.690> we<00:04:45.020> now<00:04:45.199> use<00:04:45.470> bricks<00:04:45.889> to<00:04:46.130> hold<00:04:46.310> our

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
system we now use bricks to hold our

system we now use bricks to hold our
throttle<00:04:47.620> anyway<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:49.520> outlet<00:04:50.000> temperature

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
throttle anyway that outlet temperature

throttle anyway that outlet temperature
is

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729

reading about 39 degrees inlet
temperature<00:04:55.580> down<00:04:56.150> there<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.689> 72<00:05:00.879> I'd<00:05:01.879> say

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
temperature down there is 72 I'd say

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.519 
temperature down there is 72 I'd say
this<00:05:04.569> turn<00:05:05.569> that<00:05:05.779> off<00:05:05.839> for<00:05:06.199> now<00:05:08.139> I'd<00:05:09.139> say<00:05:09.349> this

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
this turn that off for now I'd say this

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:10.480 
this turn that off for now I'd say this
sounds<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.979> little<00:05:10.219> bit<00:05:10.309> of<00:05:10.400> an

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
sounds like a little bit of an

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.290 
sounds like a little bit of an
overcharge<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.229> bit<00:05:15.379> maybe<00:05:15.589> or<00:05:16.099> a<00:05:16.610> problem

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
overcharge just a bit maybe or a problem

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.869 
overcharge just a bit maybe or a problem
with<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:17.719> TXV<00:05:18.589> which<00:05:18.889> is<00:05:19.039> part<00:05:19.309> of<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.580> right

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
with the TXV which is part of that right

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.350 
with the TXV which is part of that right
there<00:05:22.089> built<00:05:23.089> in<00:05:23.300> part<00:05:23.629> of<00:05:23.719> the<00:05:23.779> coil<00:05:23.990> but

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
there built in part of the coil but

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.540 
there built in part of the coil but
that's<00:05:26.360> pretty<00:05:26.509> much<00:05:26.629> it<00:05:27.370> pressures<00:05:28.370> are

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
that's pretty much it pressures are

that's pretty much it pressures are
settling<00:05:28.909> up<00:05:29.089> I<00:05:29.360> don't<00:05:30.020> know<00:05:30.080> what<00:05:30.199> you<00:05:30.439> know

settling up I don't know what you know

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.040 
settling up I don't know what you know
much<00:05:30.979> more<00:05:31.219> to<00:05:31.339> do<00:05:31.490> for<00:05:31.759> it<00:05:32.529> line<00:05:33.529> is<00:05:33.770> sweating

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
much more to do for it line is sweating

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.110 
much more to do for it line is sweating
and<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.319> is<00:05:36.469> dripping<00:05:36.919> but<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:37.370> does<00:05:37.580> not<00:05:37.789> cool

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
and it is dripping but it does not cool

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.639 
and it is dripping but it does not cool
you<00:05:38.300> down<00:05:42.309> so<00:05:43.309> I<00:05:43.339> don't<00:05:43.460> know
