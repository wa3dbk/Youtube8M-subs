00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.149
 determine the value of the sum of fractions 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 below alternative to five more rooms 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.530
 seven means 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.289
 I already did the mm 142 here ó projections of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.940
 four until you do not realize that the room 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.410
 to divide by 4 2 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.439
 Can you do eventually 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:29.060
 to reach the process is 4/4 to 1 13 554 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:43.340
 / 22 of 7 14 a result so much more 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:49.750
 14 that is 1941 alternative 1946 and eight 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:01:10.960
 actions we are not even denominator 18 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:21.530
 22 23 24 and at the same time by the 26 45 29 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:25.070
 24 alternatives and 2 500 plus 37 years 75 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.510
 and 79 wine with 5 will stay at a set per 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:37.730
 7.55 and 7.5535 / five to seven times 2a 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:43.460
 14 35 right in the simple 3 to 15 result 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:47.720
 final 14 plus 15 29 out of 35 alternative 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.650
 it's central mmcd 96 né will give 2 693 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 is 10.3 of a whore and 13 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:03.770
 392 18 in the girl there 1892 times 10 2018 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.420
 by 6 to 3 times 13 of the current plus three 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.540
 about 18 or 23 on 18 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:20.090
 alternatives and it is 29 over 35 years of 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.090
 alternative penalty of 23 out of 18
