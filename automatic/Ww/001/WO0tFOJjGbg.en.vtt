00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
then there's the other parts of the of

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.550 
then there's the other parts of the of
the<00:02:31.459> script<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.940> are<00:02:32.090> completely<00:02:33.019> taken

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
the script that are completely taken

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.050

from<00:02:33.739> his<00:02:33.890> films<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.610> think<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
from his films and I think that was the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
from his films and I think that was the
original<00:02:35.329> idea<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.200> had<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.850> construct<00:02:37.850> a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
original idea I had to construct a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.880 
original idea I had to construct a
script<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.540> was<00:02:38.690> entirely<00:02:39.110> made<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
script that was entirely made up of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.770 
script that was entirely made up of
lines<00:02:40.250> from<00:02:40.670> his<00:02:40.850> films<00:02:42.040> school<00:02:43.040> starts<00:02:43.780> faces

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
lines from his films school starts faces

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.940 
lines from his films school starts faces
moist

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
moist

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.479 
moist
I<00:02:45.980> scare<00:02:46.370> me<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> forest<00:02:49.040> behind<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
I scare me it was a forest behind the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.520 
I scare me it was a forest behind the
school<00:02:49.720> watering<00:02:50.720> through<00:02:50.989> there<00:02:51.140> alone<00:02:51.410> at

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
school watering through there alone at

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.619 
school watering through there alone at
lunch<00:02:51.680> time<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:54.080> was<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> place<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.680> lost<00:02:55.629> no

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
lunch time it was a place to get lost no

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.300 
lunch time it was a place to get lost no
one<00:02:56.810> would<00:02:56.930> ever<00:02:56.959> find<00:02:57.140> me<00:02:57.530> we<00:02:57.860> started<00:02:58.250> I

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
one would ever find me we started I

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.680 
one would ever find me we started I
think<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.550> started<00:02:58.879> getting<00:02:58.970> into<00:02:59.330> all<00:02:59.629> sorts

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
think we started getting into all sorts

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.170 
think we started getting into all sorts

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
that point and then into the final

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.350 
that point and then into the final
period<00:05:13.789> where<00:05:14.419> suicide<00:05:15.349> is<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:16.550> calling<00:05:17.150> and

like<00:06:02.189> I<00:06:02.310> said<00:06:02.370> I<00:06:02.490> think<00:06:02.699> it's<00:06:02.819> still<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.210> society

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
like I said I think it's still a society

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.320 
like I said I think it's still a society
that<00:06:03.900> doesn't<00:06:04.229> quite<00:06:05.069> it<00:06:05.400> certainly<00:06:05.939> change

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
that doesn't quite it certainly change

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.499 
that doesn't quite it certainly change
but<00:06:06.599> still<00:06:06.900> doesn't<00:06:07.229> really<00:06:07.439> take<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:08.509> also

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
but still doesn't really take that also

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:16.939 
but still doesn't really take that also
seriously<00:06:13.009> nobody<00:06:14.009> behind<00:06:14.339> us<00:06:14.699> anymore
