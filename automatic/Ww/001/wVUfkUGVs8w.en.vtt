00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all today we will compare 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 the sony xperia z3 compact with the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.960
 samsung galaxy s 5 min we will see which one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.290
 is the best of these two little ones 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.059
 formats 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.469
 if we look at the z3 design side 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.490
 compact and is 5 min have to have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.110
 only one thing in common 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.370
 it's just the fact that everyone 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 really looks like his big brother 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.960
 so for example for the 5 min we go 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.600
 have a silver frame like the s5 which 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.880
 is plastic not aluminum and a dome 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 was exactly like his big brother he 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.430
 is also waterproof but it does not have a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.920
 USB port 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
 protected by a hatch and otherwise the rest 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 is typically from samsung it's very 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 close to the bag s 4 min and some 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.059
 differences but they are welcome 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.739
 for the z3 compact no doubt it is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.590
 really a xperia z that we have 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 case like the sony z3 decided 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 to round a little bit the frame for the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.020
 protected against shocks 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 personally I think it's a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 choice that is certainly very practical 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 the z3 as was three compact 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 but not necessarily successful because on 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 the z3 compact is made of plastic 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.350
 the compact z3 must be waterproof 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.699
 but its hull is not at all removable 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 result we will have in hand two small 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 smartphones would indeed they do 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 every two less than 5 inches but 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 both will give a sensation 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 very different and that's especially where 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.830
 your choice can go to one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 towards the other 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 personally I would prefer 5 min 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.990
 for its better membership but there is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.220
 to some who will prefer the z3 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 compact for its glass slab 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.770
 screen side the z3 compact and 5min are 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.900
 almost the same indeed the s5 mini is going 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.210
 make 4 5 inches while the z3 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 company will do 4.5 inches but all 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 the two we would stay on hd that their 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 gives a pixel density almost 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.159
 the same 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 but concretely as you can 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.790
 see on camera the s5 mini's screen is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 vastly better he is much more 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 bright it is more efficient with 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.220
 direct lights even though sony is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.299
 really made efforts on his screen 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 there is still work 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.840
 however, note that the z3 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 compact has more settings 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 display that the 5 min the s5 mini 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 will not necessarily need all this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.490
 but on the z3 contact it's all the same 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 welcome in the sense that the screen is not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 not necessarily very powerful z3 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.890
 compact and 5 min turn all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 two sub android 4 points 4.4 threefold 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.159
 to the last version we know 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.600
 currently in France and each of 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.850
 builders added his own 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.240
 overlay so we bet everything on 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.610
 five mini and xperia hui on the xperia z3 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.350
 compact we will still note that the s5 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.670
 mini can play on a few small 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.300
 extras that may be able to do 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.160
 the difference 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.090
 indeed he has a fingerprint sensor 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.950
 as well as a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.540
 heart rate monitor it can be useful 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.770
 to some if we look a little bit 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.180
 on performance this is where has 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.400
 really played the whole difference between 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.770
 the and three compacts and the 5 min in 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.840
 sony effect really considers her you to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.840
 three compact not as a mini 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 but as a reduced version of 100 m3 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.230
 so he kept pretty much the same 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.600
 hardware inside there are some 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 little things that have been narrowed 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.680
 but the s5 mini is really worse 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.540
 on this side if we look a little bit 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.920
 on the performance side and here we go 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.660
 really see the difference between them and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.130
 three compacts and is 5 min indeed 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.959
 sony has a policy quite 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.790
 different from samsung the idea is more 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 to have all the characteristics of the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.319
 z3 in a more compact size so 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.030
 less than 5 inches while samsung 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.250
 galaxy and five mini is really less 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 good that his big brother the s5 the z3 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.459
 compact is therefore much more powerful it 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.260
 really has the abilities worthy of a real 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.420
 flagship even sees galaxy 5 by 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.739
 example now the autonomy then 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.239
 it's a good question indeed 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.320
 experience z are not necessarily 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.829
 very well known for a very good 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.360
 autonomy 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.010
 but sony really sought to 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.570
 improve on this point there and suddenly 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.540
 the compact g3 is still better 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.109
 that z a compact on my closet 2 but 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.760
 he will hold no more than 1 5 days maximum 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.920
 samsung is not necessarily better he 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.230
 has a good battery but it will not hold 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.489
 not much more than 1.5 days to note 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.930
 that these two smartphones will have 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.829
 of a mode of extreme economy 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.900
 that is to say they will have a 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.970
 extended autonomy using only 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.600
 the main features it's 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.220
 quite practical 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.690
 if we go now to the device 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.150
 photo is where it really gets 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.980
 very interesting indeed on the sony on 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.290
 will see the usual camera from 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.329
 20.7 megapixels in the back while 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.090
 on the s 5 min it's a camera 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.000
 8 megapixels and in the end the two years 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.090
 nearly 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.530
 the same result indeed the sony is going 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.060
 to be much more parametric it goes 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.440
 give you a lot more 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.150
 options to take good pictures 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.280
 but the west 5 min does not really care 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.960
 not bad in conclusion the z3 compact and 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.190
 5min are really different indeed 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.990
 two and three compacts really have 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.010
 better performance and the only 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.990
 something that will help you 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.000
 turn instead to 1 5 min this will be 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.500
 especially his design and possibly his 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.940
 interface that has a certain charm 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200
 but for the rest sony still 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.370
 a lot of advantage I have you 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.019
 advise instead to choose you have 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.880
 if you want more information 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.680
 on the z3 compact or milk 5 min
