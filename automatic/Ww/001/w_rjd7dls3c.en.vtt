00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
the same thing so cut worms are the

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.860 
the same thing so cut worms are the
larval<00:00:34.570> stage<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:35.250> moths<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:37.570> know<00:00:37.629> there

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
pretty much the same thing so they'll

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.780

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
leaves on my kale so and I just grabbed

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.229 
leaves on my kale so and I just grabbed
them<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.769> squish<00:02:32.220> them<00:02:32.459> or<00:02:32.640> stuff<00:02:32.849> on<00:02:33.030> them

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
them and squish them or stuff on them

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.750 
them and squish them or stuff on them
but<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.349> hand<00:02:34.680> pick<00:02:34.769> them<00:02:35.099> all<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.670> way

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
but you can hand pick them all the way

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.119 
but you can hand pick them all the way
it<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:35.940> time<00:02:36.150> consuming<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> as<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.799> spot<00:02:38.010> them

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
it is time consuming so as you spot them

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.830 
it is time consuming so as you spot them
early<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.519> morning<00:02:38.879> maybe<00:02:39.120> sometimes<00:02:39.510> at

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
early in the morning maybe sometimes at

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.199 
early in the morning maybe sometimes at
night<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.970> them<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
night and you can also put them in a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.300 
night and you can also put them in a
bucket<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.540> soapy<00:02:42.720> water<00:02:42.900> or<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.190> can

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bucket of soapy water or you can

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.280 
bucket of soapy water or you can
relocate<00:02:44.549> them<00:02:44.849> somewhere<00:02:45.090> else<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.840> think

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
relocate them somewhere else but I think

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.449 
relocate them somewhere else but I think
they'll<00:02:46.410> eventually<00:02:46.650> make<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> back<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
they'll eventually make it back to the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.610 
they'll eventually make it back to the
gardens<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.329> just<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:48.989> rid<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.140> them<00:02:49.349> so

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
gardens so I just get rid of them so

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
gardens so I just get rid of them so
that's<00:02:50.220> another<00:02:50.489> thing<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.970> hand<00:02:51.209> picking

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that's another thing is hand picking

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.500 
that's another thing is hand picking
them<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.860> another<00:02:53.069> great<00:02:53.340> idea<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.209> I've

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
them now another great idea and I've

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.199

think<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.130> would<00:03:38.280> trust<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.419> know<00:03:39.480> some

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
think I would trust it and I know some

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.920 
think I would trust it and I know some
people<00:03:39.840> use<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:41.340> I've<00:03:41.730> been<00:03:41.760> doing<00:03:42.630> some

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
people use this but I've been doing some

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.860 
people use this but I've been doing some
reading<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:44.150> recognized<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.299> name<00:03:45.510> when<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
reading and I recognized the name when I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.250 
reading and I recognized the name when I
came<00:03:45.989> across<00:03:46.609> GM<00:03:47.609> oh<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.329> Jamo<00:03:48.599> article

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
came across GM oh this Jamo article

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.190 
came across GM oh this Jamo article
genetically<00:03:49.769> modified<00:03:50.419> organisms<00:03:51.419> and<00:03:51.720> they

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
genetically modified organisms and they

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.430 
genetically modified organisms and they
actually<00:03:52.380> used<00:03:52.859> beet

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
actually used beet

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.970 
actually used beet
ii-in<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.570> seeds<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.740> know<00:03:56.860> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
ii-in to the seeds that you know the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
farmers some farmers grow and it's been

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.690 
farmers some farmers grow and it's been
there's<00:04:01.150> some<00:04:01.270> studies<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.870> has<00:04:02.110> shown<00:04:02.770> some

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
there's some studies that has shown some

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.690 
there's some studies that has shown some
people<00:04:04.030> showing<00:04:04.600> traces<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.100> BT<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.220> their

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
people showing traces of BT in their

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.990 
people showing traces of BT in their
blood<00:04:06.910> streams<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.660> what<00:04:08.590> BT<00:04:09.400> does<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.880> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
blood streams and what BT does to the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.890 
blood streams and what BT does to the
insects<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.440> makes<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.670> insect<00:04:13.480> stomachs

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
insects is it makes this insect stomachs

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.380 
insects is it makes this insect stomachs
explode<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.650> that's<00:04:14.770> how<00:04:14.890> they<00:04:15.040> die<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.150> it

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
explode and that's how they die so it

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.860 
explode and that's how they die so it
causes<00:04:16.690> these<00:04:17.080> little<00:04:17.500> holes<00:04:18.340> in<00:04:18.640> their<00:04:18.870> gut

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
causes these little holes in their gut

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.320 
causes these little holes in their gut
the<00:04:20.080> lining<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.440> their<00:04:20.530> guts<00:04:20.769> so<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.790> can<00:04:22.210> only

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
the lining of their guts so I can only

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.410 
the lining of their guts so I can only
imagine<00:04:22.510> if<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.110> consume<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:23.680> much<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.980> this

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
imagine if we consume so much of this

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.690 
imagine if we consume so much of this
but<00:04:25.420> bacteria<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.100> it's<00:04:27.220> been<00:04:27.310> fine

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
but bacteria you know and it's been fine

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.180 
but bacteria you know and it's been fine
into<00:04:27.910> our<00:04:28.000> bloodstream<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:29.170> I'm<00:04:29.230> kind<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
into our bloodstream so I'm kind of

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.040 
into our bloodstream so I'm kind of
wondering<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:31.330> cause<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.780> leaky

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
wondering if that can cause the leaky

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.200 
wondering if that can cause the leaky
gut<00:04:32.080> disease<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.740> don't<00:04:33.040> know<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.700> I'm<00:04:33.970> going<00:04:34.150> to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
gut disease I don't know so I'm going to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.690 
gut disease I don't know so I'm going to
stay<00:04:34.420> away<00:04:34.570> from<00:04:34.630> BT<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:35.770> but<00:04:35.980> you<00:04:36.040> can<00:04:36.070> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
stay away from BT so but you can you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.830 
stay away from BT so but you can you
know<00:04:36.820> they<00:04:36.940> said<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.210> your<00:04:37.300> own<00:04:37.510> that's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
know they said in your own that's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.750 
know they said in your own that's
another<00:04:38.050> way<00:04:38.290> they<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.500> lot<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.620> people<00:04:38.710> use<00:04:39.160> to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
another way they a lot of people use to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.430 
another way they a lot of people use to
get<00:04:40.000> rid<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.150> caterpillars<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:40.900> one<00:04:41.170> last

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
get rid of caterpillars so one last

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.230 
get rid of caterpillars so one last
thing<00:04:41.650> that's<00:04:41.830> very<00:04:42.070> useful<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.700> me<00:04:42.940> is

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
thing that's very useful to me is

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.630 
thing that's very useful to me is
companion<00:04:44.050> planting<00:04:44.530> as<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> mentioned<00:04:45.550> before

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
companion planting as I mentioned before

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.790 
companion planting as I mentioned before
in<00:04:45.970> my<00:04:46.150> selects<00:04:46.900> video<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.410> uploaded

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
in my selects video that I uploaded

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.100 
in my selects video that I uploaded
about<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.130> week<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.490> half<00:04:48.520> ago<00:04:48.790> so<00:04:49.750> they<00:04:49.960> also

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
about a week and a half ago so they also

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.670 
about a week and a half ago so they also
deter<00:04:50.620> slugs<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.550> herbs<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.390> flowers<00:04:52.690> since

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
deter slugs the herbs and flowers since

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.230 
deter slugs the herbs and flowers since
they<00:04:53.830> put<00:04:54.010> out<00:04:54.100> this<00:04:54.220> strong<00:04:54.520> sense<00:04:54.820> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
they put out this strong sense and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.380 
they put out this strong sense and
that's<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.350> plants<00:04:56.680> defense<00:04:57.100> mechanism<00:04:57.730> so

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
that's the plants defense mechanism so

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.260 
that's the plants defense mechanism so
what<00:04:59.290> I<00:04:59.320> really<00:04:59.620> like<00:04:59.860> that<00:05:00.250> really<00:05:00.760> has<00:05:01.240> a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
what I really like that really has a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.240 
what I really like that really has a
strong<00:05:01.390> scent<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.230> lavender<00:05:02.830> rosemary<00:05:04.230> sage

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
strong scent is lavender rosemary sage

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.730 
strong scent is lavender rosemary sage
thyme<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.760> think<00:05:07.450> barrage<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:08.200> don't<00:05:08.410> have<00:05:08.590> any

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
thyme I think barrage I don't have any

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.680 
thyme I think barrage I don't have any
of<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.430> that's<00:05:09.640> another<00:05:09.880> good<00:05:10.180> one<00:05:10.360> I

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
of that but that's another good one I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.570 
of that but that's another good one I
don't<00:05:11.200> have<00:05:11.440> mugwort<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:12.040> that's<00:05:12.190> also

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
don't have mugwort but that's also

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.450 
don't have mugwort but that's also
another<00:05:12.880> good<00:05:13.419> one<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.630> plant<00:05:14.400> along<00:05:15.400> with

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
another good one to plant along with

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.060 
another good one to plant along with
your<00:05:15.820> plans<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:16.990> I've<00:05:17.140> had<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:17.740> some<00:05:17.950> in

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
your plans so I've had I have some in

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.409 
your plans so I've had I have some in
separate<00:05:18.430> pots<00:05:18.580> right<00:05:18.820> now<00:05:18.940> but<00:05:19.120> I'm<00:05:19.180> going<00:05:19.300> to

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
separate pots right now but I'm going to

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.659 
separate pots right now but I'm going to
put<00:05:19.660> them<00:05:19.840> actually<00:05:20.230> in<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.410> same<00:05:20.650> garden<00:05:21.430> box

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
put them actually in the same garden box

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.930 
put them actually in the same garden box
as<00:05:21.940> my<00:05:22.320> leafy<00:05:23.320> greens<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:24.190> hopefully<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.850> will

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
as my leafy greens so hopefully it will

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.060 
as my leafy greens so hopefully it will
deter<00:05:25.360> all<00:05:25.900> these<00:05:26.140> caterpillars<00:05:26.710> from<00:05:26.770> coming

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
deter all these caterpillars from coming

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:34.159 
deter all these caterpillars from coming
back

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.709 

did<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:34.979> leave<00:05:35.159> me<00:05:35.189> something<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:36.389> can<00:05:36.539> see

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
did it leave me something you can see

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.580 
did it leave me something you can see
that<00:05:36.960> that's<00:05:37.409> their<00:05:37.710> poo<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:40.080> yeah<00:05:40.259> I've<00:05:40.319> been

have to sow some seeds and these are not
very<00:06:13.529> big<00:06:13.770> plans<00:06:14.069> but<00:06:14.310> at<00:06:14.550> least<00:06:14.729> they'll<00:06:15.180> grow

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
very big plans but at least they'll grow

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.820 
very big plans but at least they'll grow
faster<00:06:16.430> here's<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.199> plastic<00:06:19.199> water<00:06:19.379> bottles

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
faster here's the plastic water bottles

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.379 
faster here's the plastic water bottles
that<00:06:19.919> are<00:06:20.039> we<00:06:20.189> used<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.639> surround<00:06:20.849> the

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
that are we used to surround the

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.499 
that are we used to surround the
seedlings<00:06:21.900> these<00:06:22.169> are<00:06:22.319> the<00:06:22.409> Russian<00:06:22.800> kale<00:06:23.509> and

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
seedlings these are the Russian kale and

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.170 
seedlings these are the Russian kale and
there's<00:06:24.719> that<00:06:24.930> white<00:06:25.319> paper<00:06:25.589> tube<00:06:25.889> roll<00:06:26.189> these
