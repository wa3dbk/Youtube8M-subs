very interesting the bottom of the unit
is<00:02:47.680> completely<00:02:48.040> toolless<00:02:48.849> all<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.660> do<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
is completely toolless all you do is

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.780 
is completely toolless all you do is
move<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.110> latch<00:02:50.290> over<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.890> unlock<00:02:51.579> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
move this latch over here to unlock it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.660 
move this latch over here to unlock it
and<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.630> slide<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:53.410> very<00:02:54.250> roughly

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
and we just slide this off very roughly

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.330 
and we just slide this off very roughly
like<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:55.799> there<00:02:56.799> we<00:02:56.920> go

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
like this there we go

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
like this there we go
not<00:02:57.760> very<00:02:57.970> roughly<00:02:58.269> comes<00:02:59.200> off<00:02:59.350> easily<00:02:59.829> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
not very roughly comes off easily and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
not very roughly comes off easily and
there<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> in<00:03:02.920> science<00:03:03.310> everything

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
there we have the in science everything

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.400 
there we have the in science everything
is<00:03:04.150> secure<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> want<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> note<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.139> there's

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
is secure I want to note that there's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.860 
is secure I want to note that there's
rubber<00:03:05.650> everywhere<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:07.209> know<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.720> case

rubber everywhere you know in case
there's<00:03:08.079> any<00:03:08.230> shock<00:03:09.239> ok<00:03:10.239> now<00:03:10.389> they've<00:03:10.540> done<00:03:10.690> a

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
there's any shock ok now they've done a

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.930 
there's any shock ok now they've done a
lot<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.350> keep<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.650> hard<00:03:11.920> drive<00:03:12.069> safe<00:03:12.760> and

lot to keep this hard drive safe and
secure<00:03:13.209> first<00:03:13.540> there's<00:03:13.750> rubber<00:03:14.049> around<00:03:14.290> here

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
secure first there's rubber around here

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.620 
secure first there's rubber around here
to<00:03:14.680> absorb<00:03:14.980> shock<00:03:15.250> that's<00:03:16.060> nice

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
to absorb shock that's nice

mounted to the frame and that's gonna

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.069 
mounted to the frame and that's gonna
also<00:03:23.590> help<00:03:24.220> reduce<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.940> shock<00:03:25.480> or<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
also help reduce the shock or the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.449 
also help reduce the shock or the
transmission<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.680> shock<00:03:26.859> that<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.160> by<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.430> to

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
transmission of shock that is by up to

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.470 
transmission of shock that is by up to
50%

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
50%

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.759 
50%

now they've they've done a combination

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.559 
now they've they've done a combination
of<00:03:30.069> things<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.340> they<00:03:30.489> call<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.849> 3d<00:03:31.180> drive

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
of things you they call it the 3d drive

guard the other thing that's really nice
about<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.760> there<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.510> three<00:03:34.930> axis<00:03:35.109> digital

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
about this there is a three axis digital

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.770 
about this there is a three axis digital
accelerometer<00:03:36.250> built<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.940> what<00:03:37.599> that's

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
accelerometer built in and what that's

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.300 
accelerometer built in and what that's
gonna<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.109> is<00:03:38.139> if<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.500> detects<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.190> know

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
gonna do is if it detects that you know

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.009 
gonna do is if it detects that you know
something<00:03:39.609> is<00:03:39.700> happening<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.630> system<00:03:40.900> is

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
something is happening the system is

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.129 
something is happening the system is
dropping<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:42.310> will<00:03:42.489> stop<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.269> movement<00:03:44.049> of

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
dropping it will stop the movement of

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.409 
dropping it will stop the movement of
the<00:03:44.230> hard<00:03:44.410> drive<00:03:44.880> everything<00:03:45.880> all<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.120> motion

the hard drive everything all the motion

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.289 
the hard drive everything all the motion
stops<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.410> head<00:03:47.680> also<00:03:48.130> locks<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.150> that's

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
stops and the head also locks so that's

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.020 
stops and the head also locks so that's
gonna<00:03:49.419> prevent<00:03:49.780> damage<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.620> drive<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.310> also

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
gonna prevent damage to the drive I also

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.699 
gonna prevent damage to the drive I also
want<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.329> note<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.540> only<00:03:52.780> one<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.290> RAM

over top of this so it's difficult to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.219 
over top of this so it's difficult to
scratch<00:04:41.520> my<00:04:42.520> cat<00:04:42.820> claws<00:04:43.690> are<00:04:43.930> not<00:04:44.020> doing
