00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.509
 or fast 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.959
 because another expert is ours 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.139

 caressing 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.289
 in case of guarantees that the discussion is about 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.069
 what to do 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.389
 will continue 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.809
 so does our bureaucracy 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.379
 democracy 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.609
 it is a difficult process 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.309
 the company goes long 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:51.589
 and is expensive 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.289

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.549
 sport 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.019
