little handle first and let me show you

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.720 
little handle first and let me show you
actually<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> modification<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.370> was<00:04:20.489> trying

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
actually the modification I was trying

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.360 
actually the modification I was trying
to<00:04:20.850> accomplish<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:24.750> know<00:04:25.220> like<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.310> said

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
to accomplish you know like I said

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.500 
to accomplish you know like I said
before<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:27.420> know<00:04:27.450> it's<00:04:27.900> not<00:04:28.200> designed<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.510> fit

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
before you know it's not designed to fit

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.790 
before you know it's not designed to fit
into<00:04:30.660> this<00:04:30.780> little<00:04:30.930> piece<00:04:31.170> here<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.500> side

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
into this little piece here on the side

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.960 
into this little piece here on the side
and<00:04:32.070> act<00:04:32.790> as<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.020> latch<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.290> keep<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> lid<00:04:34.970> tight

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
and act as a latch to keep the lid tight

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.560 
and act as a latch to keep the lid tight
or<00:04:36.780> as<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.080> handle<00:04:37.440> here<00:04:37.730> bust<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:38.910> put<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.270> into

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
or as a handle here bust you put it into

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.620 
or as a handle here bust you put it into
a<00:04:40.040> pouch<00:04:41.040> it's<00:04:41.880> not<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:43.290> know<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.830> didn't<00:04:44.070> fit

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
a pouch it's not you know it didn't fit

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.020 
a pouch it's not you know it didn't fit
so<00:04:45.630> what<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.810> was<00:04:46.020> trying<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.500> do<00:04:46.680> was<00:04:47.580> actually

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
so what I was trying to do was actually

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.320 
so what I was trying to do was actually
straighten<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.510> piece<00:04:48.720> out<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:50.160> fit<00:04:51.120> just

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
straighten the piece out so it fit just

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.430 
straighten the piece out so it fit just
like<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:53.000> when<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.090> was<00:04:54.180> collapsed<00:04:57.440> it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
like that and when it was collapsed it

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.900 
like that and when it was collapsed it
would<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.710> flush<00:04:59.010> on<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.220> side<00:04:59.490> so<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.820> would

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
would be flush on the side so it would

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.350 
would be flush on the side so it would
fit<00:04:59.940> into<00:05:00.780> one<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.500> containers<00:05:02.030> or<00:05:03.030> if<00:05:03.240> it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
fit into one of the containers or if it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.070 
fit into one of the containers or if it
was<00:05:04.370> flipped<00:05:05.370> upward<00:05:05.790> like<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.210> could<00:05:06.930> use

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
was flipped upward like that could use

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.000 
was flipped upward like that could use
it<00:05:07.260> kind<00:05:07.380> of<00:05:07.470> like<00:05:07.530> as<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> pot<00:05:08.070> hanger<00:05:09.080> so<00:05:10.080> I'm

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
it kind of like as a pot hanger so I'm

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.350 
it kind of like as a pot hanger so I'm
about<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.250> play<00:05:11.340> around<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:11.669> some<00:05:11.910> other
