00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
me was that that safety did not react at

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.810 
me was that that safety did not react at
all<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.740> if<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.040> isolated

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
all I don't know if this is isolated
