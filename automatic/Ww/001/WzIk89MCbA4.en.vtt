Orange<00:02:04.440> like<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.160> just<00:02:05.340> showed<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.910> when<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
Orange like I just showed you when I

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.430 
Orange like I just showed you when I
first<00:02:07.260> put<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.869> having<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
first put it on I was like not having it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.520 
first put it on I was like not having it
because<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.340> made<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.390> skin<00:02:12.450> look<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.349> little

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because it made my skin look a little

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.820 
because it made my skin look a little
orange<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:14.730> probably<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:16.350> did

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
orange but that's probably because I did

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.809 
orange but that's probably because I did
see<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.460> was<00:02:17.700> already<00:02:18.060> turning<00:02:18.450> our

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
see that it was already turning our

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.660 
see that it was already turning our
ang<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.900> still<00:02:20.349> was<00:02:20.680> applying<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.489> my

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
ang and I still was applying it to my

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.069 
ang and I still was applying it to my
face<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:23.010> subconsciously<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.489> knew<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:25.079> it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
face and subconsciously I knew that it

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.690 
face and subconsciously I knew that it
would<00:02:26.620> probably<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.609> kind<00:02:28.329> of<00:02:28.420> mess<00:02:28.659> up<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
would probably like kind of mess up the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.970 
would probably like kind of mess up the
color<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.239> foundation<00:02:31.810> but<00:02:32.499> then<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.859> a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
color of the foundation but then in a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
color of the foundation but then in a
different<00:02:33.430> light<00:02:33.579> I<00:02:33.609> did<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.359> it<00:02:34.689> was

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
different light I did see that it was

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.030 
different light I did see that it was
all<00:02:35.079> good<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.519> coverage<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.659> is<00:02:38.040> when

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
all good so the coverage of this is when

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.809 
all good so the coverage of this is when
he<00:02:39.159> first<00:02:39.459> put<00:02:40.389> it<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.689> it<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:42.280> kind<00:02:42.609> of<00:02:42.730> like

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
he first put it on it is kind of like

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.379 
he first put it on it is kind of like
very<00:02:43.150> thin<00:02:43.599> and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.430> thing<00:02:45.669> is<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.269> don't

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
very thin and the thing is you don't

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.179 
very thin and the thing is you don't
want<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.629> put<00:02:46.810> too<00:02:46.840> much<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.469> your<00:02:47.620> hands

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
because it is wasteful and like I said

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.300 
because it is wasteful and like I said
it's<00:02:52.180> very<00:02:52.389> thin<00:02:52.689> and<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.109> does<00:02:53.409> spread<00:02:53.829> evenly

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's very thin and it does spread evenly

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.629 
it's very thin and it does spread evenly
like<00:02:55.299> if<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.719> do<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.049> your<00:02:56.200> hands<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.889> am

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
little Dewey I'm guessing it's because

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.099 
little Dewey I'm guessing it's because
of<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.239> sun<00:03:31.659> block<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.259> it<00:03:32.409> um<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:34.329> tells<00:03:34.930> you

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
of the sun block in it um it tells you

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.679 
of the sun block in it um it tells you
on<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.409> directions<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.040> apply<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:37.030> few

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
on the directions to apply it a few

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.259 
on the directions to apply it a few
minutes<00:03:37.870> before<00:03:38.379> sun<00:03:38.709> exposure<00:03:39.120> which<00:03:40.120> is

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
minutes before sun exposure which is

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.050 
minutes before sun exposure which is
totally<00:03:40.750> whatever<00:03:41.199> but<00:03:41.979> all<00:03:42.189> in<00:03:42.430> all<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.609> really

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
totally whatever but all in all I really

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.119 
totally whatever but all in all I really
like<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.479> now<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.900> first<00:03:44.199> time<00:03:44.439> I<00:03:44.500> used<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:45.069> I

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
like it now the first time I used it I

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.030 
like it now the first time I used it I
made<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.879> mistake<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.689> I<00:03:46.959> use<00:03:47.199> dis<00:03:47.500> stippling

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
made a mistake and I use dis stippling

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.399 
made a mistake and I use dis stippling
brush<00:03:48.540> basically<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.900> left<00:03:50.349> me<00:03:50.650> super<00:03:51.489> streaky

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
brush basically it left me super streaky

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.259 
brush basically it left me super streaky
because<00:03:53.409> it<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.889> very<00:03:53.919> thick<00:03:54.819> when<00:03:55.090> you're

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
because it is very thick when you're

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.110 
because it is very thick when you're
applying<00:03:55.569> it<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.259> working<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:57.819> then

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
