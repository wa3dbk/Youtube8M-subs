00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
is really bad like the original scope

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.660 
is really bad like the original scope
for<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.290> i<00:03:08.350> usually<00:03:08.740> put<00:03:08.830> variable<00:03:09.310> zoom<00:03:09.460> on

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
for it so i usually put variable zoom on
