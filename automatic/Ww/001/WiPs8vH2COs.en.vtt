00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
 hi people I apologize ever 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.080
 in advance my neighbor world since 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.860
 felt four and a half hours are two 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.299
 square lawn and yes 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.260
 That's why you hear from time to time 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.189
 any sounds like you already 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.519
 You can read a headline mac city 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.500
 glossybox I have the glossybox since 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 turned off some time so I have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 but that quit because I just 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.000
 was not satisfied for the 15 euro 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.200
 What you got every month has it 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 I no longer satisfies them 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 actually it was small samples of it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 were stupid rehearsals it was always 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.899
 coming same things anyway and it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 can sometimes pretend to be like that 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.050
 Last rank rising like thrown rhein 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.520
 has and then I was sometime 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.660
 really not satisfied anymore i know 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 even she was no longer with it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 satisfied with the box and that's why 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 me me then some time ago me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.399
 do not even two months 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.530
 three months, I do not quite remember 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 I had a precisely terminated time yes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 two more times then the box of 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.820
 presented to my girlfriend 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.409
 because I thought that is still 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 interesting to see what's in there 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.290
 but she also turned her off 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 because then you do not bother anymore 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 had as 15 euros a month for buns 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 For things you might not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 needs and actually if so comes 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.299
 maybe just use the box 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 is a bit expensive boxing gets 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.759
 one euro shops already for one euro 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.970
 or 1 50 2 euro you do not need one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.490
 spend 15 euros and the samples 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 To be honest, it was a lot 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.659
 glossy boxes stacked on top of each other 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.829
 but still all things in it and I have 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.850
 not even taken out somehow 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 and so it was really stupid I got 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.009
 you then quit and then have me 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.200
 I said with the 15 euro a month 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.810
 save now so I can do something 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.509
 Much better start with a product 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 for example, whatever I am 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.170
 or what I use then too 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.780
 actually use that will have 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.660
 also written many 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.670
 for the 15 euros I spend there 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.040
 you should really something better 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 and I did that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.680
 because I was at mac and thought so 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.550
 I'll get me for my 15 euros 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.930
 save me 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.350
 a product which I then actually 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.110
 I also like something like mine 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.910
 becomes a favorite and where I enjoy it 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.709
 this product then really too 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.310
 and I have that too 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.170
 made 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.330
 I got a lipstick myself 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.040
 the lipstick costs a little more 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.660
 as 15 euros the cost 18 euros 50 so 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.769
 I now have three fifty euros more 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.920
 output 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.769
 but i thought hey this product 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.860
 you have a lot more of that and you 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.660
 I would very much like to wear it 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.670
 then maybe just in that color 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.860
 is totally in love and I then 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.910
 I made my lipstick now 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.830
 find on 4 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.630
 I have a lipstick with me 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.790
 Mac bought as I said and I try 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.110
 to do that every month now 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.030
 if it does not succeed then I can do it 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.120
 it does not stop but I have it then 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.209
 I go every month once I go 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.670
 there in sum counter and search me 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.070
 then something in the color spoonbill and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.430
 he looks like everyone knows how 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:32.720
 mac lipstick looks like this is vice 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:35.030
 finish focus that's exactly what he looks like and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 there was also this from mac the marilyn 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.730
 monroe but somehow it does not have me 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.140
 really what they were talking about 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.549
 partly all more expensive 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.829
 and I thought no, I 'm starting now 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.390
 not somehow experienced in this and 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.070
 Get me something now because now 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.560
 just sort of half it yourself 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.690
 just give us something that really interests me 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.019
 I like this and now I have this 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:05.290
 Lipstick brought because looks and 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.709
 Swatch yourself once more intense 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.540
 and once easier that's it 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.070
 lipstick that's two three now 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.400
 layers and that is only one now 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.139
 layer and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.329
 a great color as I think and 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.729
 the tragic but I already have 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.919
 two three videos already shot in advance 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.110
 that's why it's gone a bit 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.139
 I like the remake 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.320

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.240

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.840
 I just took it to the 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.199
 cash register and then I'm a car and have 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.539
 then opened them 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.210
 yes I would submit my lips 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:23.110
 because yes you really have everyone 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.820
 little seen on the lips 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.870

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.220
 Take a break at home and yes what 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.990
 I'm actually telling you now 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.790
 I hate this lipstick so dull 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.640
 finish has not me yet 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.490
 convinced and that's why I thought 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.270
 if I manage every month 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.240
 lipstick budget of 15 euro me times 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.030
 the devastated a little bit 15 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.250
 to find something but euroglas me 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.990
 I like lipstick, I use it too 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.790
 very often and I regret this 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.840
 this money also does not invest it 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.550
 Does not hurt me and shit 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.420
 I would say glossybox now 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.510

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.380
