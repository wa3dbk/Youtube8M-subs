are<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.369> really<00:00:29.760> good<00:00:30.029> quality<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
are actually really good quality but a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
into winter and what I'm going to show

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
into winter and what I'm going to show
you<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> change<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.520> blade<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you is just how the change of blade I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.910 
you is just how the change of blade I
mean<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> might<00:00:42.899> look<00:00:43.050> obvious<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
mean it might look obvious but with the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
mean it might look obvious but with the
white<00:00:44.070> head<00:00:44.250> slightly<00:00:44.579> different<00:00:45.030> needs<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
white head slightly different needs the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.340 
white head slightly different needs the
screwdriver<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.039> Philips<00:00:47.460> head<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> take<00:00:48.960> off

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
screwdriver a Philips head you take off

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
screwdriver a Philips head you take off
this<00:00:49.640> central<00:00:50.640> screw<00:00:51.000> again<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:56.699> pulls<00:00:56.969> out

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this central screw again that pulls out

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
this central screw again that pulls out
the<00:00:57.360> blade<00:00:59.510> what<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> use<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> pull<00:01:01.829> X

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the blade what I use is a pull X

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
the blade what I use is a pull X
standard<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.290> fairly<00:01:04.680> hard

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
standard so I think it's fairly hard

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.600 
standard so I think it's fairly hard
again<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.080> for<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.290> reason<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> forms<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
again but for some reason if it forms a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
again but for some reason if it forms a
bit<00:01:09.150> better<00:01:09.390> than<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> red<00:01:10.380> coloured<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:13.100> if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bit better than this red coloured one if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.760 
bit better than this red coloured one if
you<00:01:14.250> take<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> pad<00:01:14.790> off<00:01:15.350> I'm<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> show

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you take the pad off I'm going to show

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.539 
you take the pad off I'm going to show
you<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.159> better

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you a bit better

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
you a bit better
the<00:01:18.420> clips<00:01:18.720> slide<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.420> Center

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the clips slide off and then Center

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.890 
the clips slide off and then Center
you've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.170> our<00:01:22.350> hole<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.720> which<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you've got our hole here for which the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
you've got our hole here for which the
screw<00:01:25.229> goes<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.860> through<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.369> actually

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
screw goes right through and actually

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
screw goes right through and actually
holds<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> blade<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.810> place<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> doesn't

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
holds the blade in place so it doesn't

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
holds the blade in place so it doesn't
actually<00:01:29.100> slip<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:32.270> we<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.299> change<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
actually slip out we just change the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually slip out we just change the
blade<00:01:36.079> it's<00:01:37.079> easier<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.470> you've<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
blade it's easier if you've got a bit of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
blade it's easier if you've got a bit of
soap<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> water<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:42.170> as<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.470> dog

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
soap and water on this as you know a dog

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.760 
soap and water on this as you know a dog
ear<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> channels<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.170> how<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.590> an

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
ear the channels so how it's all an

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.850 
ear the channels so how it's all an
equal<00:01:46.979> amount<00:01:47.780> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> tip<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.470> between

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the top and the side and well that's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
the top and the side and well that's
actually<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> blurred<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.180> never

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
actually going blurred or not but never

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.310 
actually going blurred or not but never
mind<00:01:55.579> come<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> other<00:01:56.880> end<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
mind come to the other end now this is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.749 
mind come to the other end now this is
where<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> blade<00:01:58.799> cut<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.280> better<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
where a blade cut will be better the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
where a blade cut will be better the
scissors<00:02:00.149> aren't<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> brilliant

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
scissors aren't all that brilliant

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
scissors aren't all that brilliant
cut<00:02:02.700> fairly<00:02:03.150> close<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.810> edge<00:02:03.900> again<00:02:08.810> get

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
cut fairly close to the edge again get

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.360 
cut fairly close to the edge again get
an<00:02:09.930> equal<00:02:10.200> amount<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.590> each<00:02:10.710> side<00:02:13.190> slide<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
an equal amount on each side slide it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
an equal amount on each side slide it
back<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:16.550> look<00:02:17.550> for<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> hole<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> middle

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
back in look for the hole in the middle

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
back in look for the hole in the middle
and<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.860> screw<00:02:20.130> again<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> screwed

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
and get the screw again get that screwed

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.290 
and get the screw again get that screwed
in

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.190 

I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.960> that's<00:02:32.170> nearly<00:02:32.440> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.370
