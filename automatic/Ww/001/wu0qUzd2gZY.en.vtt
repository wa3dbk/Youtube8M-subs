00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
I think in in the console game he

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.220 
I think in in the console game he
actually<00:06:50.950> pulls<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.310> finger<00:06:51.700> at<00:06:52.230> however

actually pulls the finger at however

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.590 
actually pulls the finger at however
he's<00:06:53.440> driving<00:06:53.950> over<00:06:54.130> but<00:06:55.120> in<00:06:55.210> this<00:06:55.270> game<00:06:55.480> he

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
he's driving over but in this game he

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.310 
he's driving over but in this game he
just<00:06:55.680> like<00:06:56.680> poster<00:06:57.280> fisted<00:06:57.730> him<00:06:58.110> but<00:06:59.110> I<00:06:59.230> don't

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320
