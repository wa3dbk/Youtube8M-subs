that<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.659> answer<00:01:47.899> is<00:01:48.020> no<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:49.280> those<00:01:49.729> DNS

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
that the answer is no that those DNS

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.239 
that the answer is no that those DNS
servers<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.719> ISP<00:01:51.139> do<00:01:51.530> not<00:01:51.679> have<00:01:51.889> an<00:01:52.009> entry

so<00:01:56.359> your<00:01:56.600> ISPs<00:01:57.200> DNS<00:01:57.469> servers<00:01:58.369> are<00:01:58.549> going<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
so your ISPs DNS servers are going to

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.190 
so your ISPs DNS servers are going to
then<00:01:59.149> in<00:01:59.450> an<00:02:00.200> instant<00:02:00.469> go<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.450> root<00:02:02.659> DNS

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
then in an instant go to the root DNS

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.510 
then in an instant go to the root DNS
servers<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.799> internet<00:02:04.130> which<00:02:04.340> are

we're<00:02:54.560> going<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.739> use<00:02:54.859> today<00:02:55.190> there's

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
we're going to use today there's

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.819 
we're going to use today there's
literally<00:02:56.269> over<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.569> thousand<00:02:57.109> registrar's<00:02:57.590> on

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
literally over a thousand registrar's on

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:58.809 
literally over a thousand registrar's on
the<00:02:57.950> internet<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.670> go<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
the internet where you can go and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.979 
the internet where you can go and
register<00:02:59.060> domain<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.230> create<00:03:00.859> glue<00:03:01.069> records

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
register domain and create glue records

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.589 
register domain and create glue records
so<00:03:02.989> step<00:03:03.230> 3<00:03:03.560> iono<00:03:04.099> again<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.879> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.209> return

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
so step 3 iono again is going to return

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.270 
so step 3 iono again is going to return
the<00:03:05.720> glue<00:03:05.900> records<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.889> say<00:03:07.250> n<00:03:07.519> s1<00:03:08.389> and<00:03:08.629> s2<00:03:08.780> are

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the glue records and say n s1 and s2 are

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.819 
the glue records and say n s1 and s2 are

keep<00:04:38.090> in<00:04:38.180> mind<00:04:38.419> this<00:04:38.540> all<00:04:38.690> happens<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.199> a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
keep in mind this all happens in a

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.870 
keep in mind this all happens in a
fraction<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.830> second<00:04:40.220> that's<00:04:40.460> kind<00:04:40.699> of<00:04:40.729> one

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
fraction of a second that's kind of one

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.189 
fraction of a second that's kind of one
of<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.060> cool<00:04:41.240> things<00:04:41.449> about<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.750> internet<00:04:42.080> is

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
of the cool things about the internet is

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.770 
of the cool things about the internet is
everything<00:04:42.470> travels<00:04:43.010> at<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.190> speed<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.610> light

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
everything travels at the speed of light

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.080 
everything travels at the speed of light
so<00:04:44.780> steps<00:04:45.199> one<00:04:45.470> through<00:04:45.500> seven<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.729> time<00:04:46.940> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
so steps one through seven the time you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.850 
so steps one through seven the time you
did<00:04:47.240> enter<00:04:47.570> on<00:04:47.750> your<00:04:47.810> web<00:04:48.199> browser<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.740> all

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
did enter on your web browser and all

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.860 
did enter on your web browser and all
this<00:04:49.040> happens<00:04:49.100> it's<00:04:49.669> literally<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.300> fraction

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
this happens it's literally a fraction

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.030 
this happens it's literally a fraction
of<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.020> second<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:53.030> step<00:04:53.360> 7<00:04:53.870> your<00:04:54.590> laptop<00:04:55.010> is

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
of a second so step 7 your laptop is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.460 
of a second so step 7 your laptop is
going<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> issue<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.699> second<00:04:56.180> request<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:57.080> the
