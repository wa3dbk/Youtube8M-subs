in chains so we're going to do we're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
in chains so we're going to do we're
gonna<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> display<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
gonna have I'm going to display it and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
gonna have I'm going to display it and
play<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> setting<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.980> its

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
play it at the setting that I have its

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.439 
play it at the setting that I have its
at<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.629> which<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:49.219> was<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.550> demo<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
at right now which is was in my demo you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.889 
at right now which is was in my demo you
can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> 45<00:00:52.590> watt<00:00:52.949> setting

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
can see here it's on the 45 watt setting

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.310 
can see here it's on the 45 watt setting
with<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> volume<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.940> o'clock

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
with the volume at about two o'clock

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.799 
with the volume at about two o'clock
that's<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> usually<00:00:58.770> keep<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
that's what I usually keep it at and

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
that's what I usually keep it at and
then<00:01:00.809> after<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> play<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> i'm<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
then after I play that i'm just going to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.410 
then after I play that i'm just going to
dime<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.180> amp<00:01:03.680> full<00:01:04.680> game<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
dime the amp full game then I'm going to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.730 
dime the amp full game then I'm going to
leave<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.750> full<00:01:07.049> gain<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> third

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
leave it on full gain and for the third

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.539 
leave it on full gain and for the third
demo<00:01:08.369> portion<00:01:08.939> I'll<00:01:09.720> kick<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.340> I'm<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
demo portion I'll kick in I'm going to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
demo portion I'll kick in I'm going to
kick<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> overdrive<00:01:12.420> section<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
kick in the overdrive section of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
kick in the overdrive section of the
pigtronix<00:01:14.970> distortion<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.220> finally<00:01:17.220> I'll

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
pigtronix distortion and finally I'll

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
pigtronix distortion and finally I'll
kick<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> off<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.540> I'll<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> fact

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
kick that off and I'll use just the fact

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.149 
kick that off and I'll use just the fact

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.570 
get a diamond now so this is full gain
on<00:02:44.520> them

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:19.539 

and

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.770 

as<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.150> gives<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.390> heck<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.750> lot

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
as you can see it gives a heck of a lot

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.960 
as you can see it gives a heck of a lot
more<00:03:21.930> saturated<00:03:22.709> that's<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.370> heavy<00:03:23.580> as<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
more saturated that's as heavy as the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.170 
more saturated that's as heavy as the
amp<00:03:24.180> alone<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.930> get<00:03:25.290> which<00:03:26.159> to<00:03:26.549> be<00:03:26.700> honest<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
amp alone can get which to be honest I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.059 
amp alone can get which to be honest I
don't<00:03:27.390> think<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.690> need<00:03:27.959> any<00:03:28.200> heavier<00:03:28.799> than

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
don't think you need any heavier than

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.240 
don't think you need any heavier than
that<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:30.060> since<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.110> guys<00:03:31.290> wanted<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> hear

don't<00:04:27.949> know<00:04:28.070> any<00:04:28.460> reason<00:04:29.000> why<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.449> would<00:04:29.720> need
