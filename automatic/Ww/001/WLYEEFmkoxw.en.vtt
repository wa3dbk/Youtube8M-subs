00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.320
 I greet all viewers with you Harad and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 in today's video we will look at combat 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 problem number 12 for tt on tank t-55 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.910
 and this task is called strong armor 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.279
 and and conditions sound like get 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.469
 damage blocked by armor 3 times 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.850
 greater strength and own car 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.870
 also do at least two thousand damage 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 additional conditions for which you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.370
 get one slot in the hangar 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.379
 it survive and win the battle for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.530
 this task is suitable 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.960
 appliances from level 6 and up but i would 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.319
 recommended specific tanks this 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 German Ninth Level E75 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.949
 and sneaker b and soviet heavy tank 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 from 7 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.479
 You ask why these tanks are all 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 just 6 to 8 levels is not enough 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.810
 armored cords 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.380
 so you tank three times as much as 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 proper hp and at the same time apply 2000 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.399
 damage 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.539
 yes of course there are cases that players on 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.799
 is-6 bc-111 god princes perform this 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.710
 combat mission 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.869
 but the chance of it is small enough as 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 These machines can quite often 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.240
 be at the bottom of the list where their armor is for 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 who is not a hindrance 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.789
 I also did not mention the German chain E100 and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.880
 the mouse who are perfectly armored and but their 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.500
 the amount hp will force you to tank 8 and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 9 thousand respectively 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.700
 which is far from happening so often in on 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.030
 These machines b slippers are 5 and 7 in their 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.310
 queue have excellent reservations 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.280
 nines are almost always a of 7 always in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.280
 your top and allows you to do this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.659
 lbz attacking a little less than six with 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.899
 half a thousand damage 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.539
 which is quite realistic for myself I chose 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.420
 rules in order to nag 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.940
 enough hp need to appear 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.760
 in not 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.340
 prominent for the enemy location to do something 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 what not to expect from you as on 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.930
 commonplace positions for tanking go 90 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.420
 percent tyazh 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.440
 reduced almost all or all 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.970
 artillery and watches a bunch of pt 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 appearing in such a position you rather 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.550
 just do not give impunity to leave 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.030
 damage and tank armor and if 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.160
 will give 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.200
 then your allies will feel that you 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.140
 control the direction 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.570
 certainly sell this flank and you do not 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 who will tank and no one will 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.170
 shoot I would recommend 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.800
 wait for the enemy's setup where there will be a minimum 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 the arts 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.380
 go where you are not particularly welcome in this 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.690
 If you risk to be alone against 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.450
 several enemies but if you borrow 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.030
 advantageous position and do not let yourself get around 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.130
 you can take enough 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.120
 amount of damage with proper skill 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.250
 and inflict a return damage in this battle 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.010
 at the beginning I took for myself 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.739
 an adventurous decision namely to go not to 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.320
 stone which usually go all the strands and 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.170
 go down to the water and try 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.810
 surprise the enemy with your position and force 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.390
 his wrong 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.430
 yes I could die there fast enough 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.980
 but my calculation paid off 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.970
 below i met foch of the ninth level 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 lorraine and 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.459
 and type 61 who wanted to kill me 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.100
 but the seven tank and through the tower not 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.130
 leave yourself a chance to break through but 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.769
 on top of me throwed yaga e100 and ok 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 tiger who has very powerful guns 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.100
 but a long distance to me is not 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.310
 allowed them to target vulnerable areas 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.970
 type 61 and yagtigr from despair even 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.910
 switched to landmines but she bear not 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.670
 significant damage could not only 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.340
 once I was not careful and set 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.040
 Vld's cheek where I broke a thousand 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.310
 Jacopo check in and the rest of the problems have 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.230
 I did not have the only art of the enemy 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.110
 for the whole fight for me so never 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.630
 threw either could not either did not want 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.410
 whether it was just sitting next to the computer 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.430
 typically 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.680
 arthrope causing damage to nines after i 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.380
 each shot turned the tower 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.170
 side top under and enemy standing on 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.570
 grief and maneuvering did not allow himself to be healed 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.520
 thus restraining distracting 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.550
 almost alone six tanks 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.560
 I gave the enemy a chance to push our team 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.330
 other flank 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.820
 mod on votan forged damage that I have 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.280
 worth a little incorrectly read damage 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.100
 blocked by armor and at the end of the battle 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.940
 it was really upset considering that 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 I lacked some 150 damage to 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.800
 perform this task but as it turned out 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.410
 as a result, he did not take into account both 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.970
 hit on mine bombs from type 61 and 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.890
 a shot from inviza pasha and as a result 6710 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.550
 damage with the required 6 and a half 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:21.250
 Try thousands of risk and you 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.320
 surely everything will turn out thanks 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.050
 watched this video if it is for you 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.150
 like click like and look at 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.150
 my channel is still all good luck 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.900
 nearly
