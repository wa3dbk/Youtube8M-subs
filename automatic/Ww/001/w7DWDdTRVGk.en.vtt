00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.570
 Y 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.800
 chicken in adobo 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.250
 the ingredients are olive oil 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:32.070
 chicken potatoes basil oregano rosemary 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.400
 lemon salt parsley sweet paprika and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 spicy paprika we removed the stems to 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.100
 the aromatic herbs and we chop their 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100
 leaves finely 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.010
 the smaller we apply them the better 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.010
 their aromas will be transferred to the oil 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.240
 although the aroma of fresh herbs 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 is more powerful and you can not find them 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.190
 you can also use dried herbs 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.009
 once we have bitten them we put them 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.009
 in a bowl 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.250
 then we add the two types of 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 peppers 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.260
 mix with a spoon we incorporate 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.980
 the lemon juice 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.140
 we mix again add the oil and 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.070
 the salt and with a beater we mix well 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.070
 All the ingredients 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 ah 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.149
 then we clean the remains of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.610
 feathers that are in the chicken for it the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.400
 we burn with a kitchen torch 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.850
 once they are clean we hallucinate with 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 the adobe 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.709
 we cover the container with a plastic and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.100
 we let the thighs rest during 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.100
 several hours 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.590
 when we go to bake the meat 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.189
 we paste some potatoes and cut them into 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.189
 thin sheets 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.310
 we put a little marinade at the base of 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.310
 a baking dish 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.370
 We distribute the potatoes over 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.310
 on these we place the thighs of 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.310
 chicken 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.890
 we put on top of the rest of the marinade and 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.409
 We take the preheated oven to 200 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.409
 degrees and we bake for 40 minutes 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.319
 once the meat is golden 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.480
 we remove from the oven and serve 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.760
