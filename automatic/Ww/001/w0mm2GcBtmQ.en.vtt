here and this pin right here on the this
one<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> number<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.549> pin

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
one here I think it's the number one pin

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.840 
one here I think it's the number one pin
take<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.590> bend<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:36.350> around<00:01:38.360> like<00:01:39.360> this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
take it and you bend it around like this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.920 
take it and you bend it around like this
keep<00:01:41.850> bending<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> way

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
keep bending it get it out of the way

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.649 
keep bending it get it out of the way
there<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.040> looks<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
there so it looks like that it's just

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.960 
there so it looks like that it's just
bent<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.909> have

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bent up out of the way and then you have

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:01.950 
bent up out of the way and then you have
to<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.390> back<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.890> back<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.460> thing
