 I'm not in the state parliament with Wayne class succeeded where I also the 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.919
 Classic or have said now

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 by every time instead of international match in that percent been recorded July 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.570
 percent 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.880
 I could come up with something about the start-up company Kollerbeck 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.700
 proceeded 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.050
 As far as I've always said, I know that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.610
 and they may happen to the interests of the creditors if the odds 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.730
 had 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 where would the important tasks be done 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.730
 Why 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.040
 but the dry cold and the music are also the only ones in the slow cycle 3 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 positive aspects GmbH Euro on its own so the only positive 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 Message 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.890
 that about the fewer couples 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.650
 you can succeed in carrying the procedure 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.430
 and the graphic designer already does what he does 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.210
 There is a small kick here 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.420
 if he is happy civilians in the field in the fair 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.480
 our first away from the bad 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.890
 Why 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.060

 and 4 PREGAS crash come what is the colds flu in bed okay 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 then it continues with Arndt Klocke 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.880
 with Bacon to make the play special in the action like 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.349
 get in loud and the like 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.609

 Switzerland the run is what actually makes planned annual sales 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.289
 Aachen 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.839
 Although like 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.609
 for the whole year 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.369
 we would be next to meat of a so-called feeding 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.329
 on the edge of the game they like it 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.539
 save the city the whole country until the first demo is their service otherwise 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.209
 different in the negative area 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.330
 from the music player nice message Lauper so leave me now a so-called

 Triptans come and say here will also adapt well in the Werder again 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.480
 But love does not need to be reassured, the men's world is the one in the whole 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.219

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.249
 he will not be soon 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.919
 either wait 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.079
 Many have to decide who to take damage quickly 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.909
 Interest can detect a liquidation of 1 there 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.669
 from the Anker Weingarten 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.829

 after he is because of 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.109
 around 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.370
 while sales are slightly left on the left as far as March 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.149
 You can control what you do when you're struggling 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.049
 as always free 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:07.970
 a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.060
 I only know that we might have a check from van der Sar further 15

 to have excuses ready 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.539
 and prevented 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.029
 Finally, I think satisfied

00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:59.509
 GEA 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.460
 Now I understand why I'm making this area federal it's gameplay 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.800
 crap 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.139

 there is the reader margins 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.849
 because of the margins 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.589
 numerous performances was easy 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:23.769
 Circular league that is unbearable so Red should be left open which lends and so what 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.080
 should that 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.379
 that off here at this point 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.509
 I do not mind this game is not the panel is nothing like it 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.319
 seems like 3 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.770
 really not 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.749
 Losses 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.400
 so that can afford German 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.409
 then you would have to bid 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.719
 Euro sunk Google is now with the customer 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.019
 but i feel in public not meant game away 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.330
 if it becomes some 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.610
 it was a nice game and the worst ever strength 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.909
 reports that one continues to fear in the community work
