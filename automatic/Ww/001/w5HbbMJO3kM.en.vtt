 violent video games the truth is 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.010
 that recently the misfortune happened

 in newton where a young man murdered 20 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.640

 violent video games can be the cause 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.870
 in this type of events it is worth it that she is

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.770
 amazing 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.050

 killer of the murderer of newtown adam 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.820
 launches to video games seems to be the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.210
 excuse that puts in vale from many 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.409
 that fantasizing about killing people is 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.869
 similar to the dirtiest pornography and 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.630
 especially when talking about video games 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.580
