the different fields of engineering the
one<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.309> stood<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:38.850> was

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
one that really stood out to me was

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.509 
one that really stood out to me was
biological<00:00:39.659> engineering<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.949> thing<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.249> love

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
biological engineering the thing I love

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.790 
biological engineering the thing I love
about<00:00:41.550> biological<00:00:42.480> engineering<00:00:42.839> is<00:00:43.109> the<00:00:43.589> many

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
about biological engineering is the many

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
about biological engineering is the many
applications<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.519> it<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:44.819> they're<00:00:45.480> trying

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
applications that it has they're trying

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380 
applications that it has they're trying
to<00:00:45.989> create<00:00:46.440> cures<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.890> diseases<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.460> well<00:00:47.879> as

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to create cures for diseases as well as

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
to create cures for diseases as well as
manage<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> energy<00:00:49.469> crisis<00:00:49.890> there's<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
manage the energy crisis there's just a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.739 
manage the energy crisis there's just a
wide<00:00:50.519> range<00:00:50.819> of<00:00:50.999> things<00:00:51.269> that<00:00:51.479> I<00:00:51.510> can

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
wide range of things that I can

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.259 
wide range of things that I can
accomplish<00:00:52.229> here<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.010> Utah<00:00:53.249> State<00:00:53.309> before<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
accomplish here at Utah State before I

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.549 
accomplish here at Utah State before I
even<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:54.839> as<00:00:54.929> a<00:00:54.960> freshman<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.440> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
even got here as a freshman when I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.139 
even got here as a freshman when I
started<00:00:55.920> looking<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.460> opportunities

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
started looking into the opportunities

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
started looking into the opportunities
that<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.600> program<00:00:57.960> gave<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> me<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.679> I<00:00:59.339> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that the program gave to me and I you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
that the program gave to me and I you
know<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> sent<00:01:00.089> out<00:01:00.210> feelers<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.229> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
know I sent out feelers to the to the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.039 
know I sent out feelers to the to the
professor's<00:01:01.879> everyone<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:02.999> very<00:01:03.210> receptive

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
professor's everyone was very receptive

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.080 
professor's everyone was very receptive
that's<00:01:04.620> just<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> environment<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:06.030> at

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's just how the environment here at

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
question the professors are very open to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
question the professors are very open to
having<00:01:20.490> new<00:01:20.700> undergraduates<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.480> their<00:01:21.600> labs

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
having new undergraduates in their labs

valuable experience that would really
help<00:01:29.100> me<00:01:29.250> throughout<00:01:29.460> my<00:01:29.550> undergraduate<00:01:30.000> as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
help me throughout my undergraduate as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.460 
help me throughout my undergraduate as
well<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.750> professional<00:01:31.170> career

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
well as my professional career

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.370 
well as my professional career
I'd<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> take<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.360> synthetic<00:01:33.750> biology

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I'd like to take like synthetic biology

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650 
I'd like to take like synthetic biology
so<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.800> learned<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.250> genetics<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:35.880> DNA<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
so I learned like genetics and DNA and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.740 
so I learned like genetics and DNA and
also<00:01:37.580> biomechanical<00:01:38.580> engineering<00:01:38.940> design

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
also biomechanical engineering design

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.220 
also biomechanical engineering design
unit<00:01:40.530> operations<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.990> learning

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
unit operations where we are learning

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.160

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
how to run a fermenter that can grow the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.680 
how to run a fermenter that can grow the
bacteria<00:01:46.370> fungi<00:01:47.370> things<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.510> use

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
bacteria fungi things that we can use

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.560 
bacteria fungi things that we can use
for<00:01:49.310> biological<00:01:50.310> products<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.060> penicillin

get<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.660> research<00:01:57.840> laboratories<00:01:58.620> where

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
get into research laboratories where

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
get into research laboratories where
you're<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.460> getting<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.760> hands-on

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you're really getting this hands-on

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.610 
you're really getting this hands-on
experience<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:00.870> you're<00:02:01.050> taking<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
experience where you're taking what you

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.990 
experience where you're taking what you
learn<00:02:01.770> from<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.040> classroom<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> directly

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
learn from the classroom and directly

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
learn from the classroom and directly
applying<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.720> lab<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.260> that's<00:02:04.680> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
applying it in the lab and that's a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
applying it in the lab and that's a
great<00:02:04.920> opportunity<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.520> further<00:02:06.360> your

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
great opportunity to further your

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.479 
great opportunity to further your
professional<00:02:07.320> development<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.340> as

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.889 
professional development as well as
prepare<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.909> for<00:02:08.940> grad<00:02:09.239> school<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
prepare you for grad school and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.559 
prepare you for grad school and
internships<00:02:10.619> during<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> summer

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
