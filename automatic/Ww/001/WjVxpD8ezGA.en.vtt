failure that's why you see my little SIM
card<00:00:21.869> tray<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:22.410> over<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:23.210> now

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
card tray right over here now

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
card tray right over here now
there<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.199> two<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.949> itty<00:00:26.310> bitty<00:00:26.609> bitty

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.990 
there are two little itty bitty bitty
bitty<00:00:27.359> components<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.800> cause<00:00:29.160> backlight

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
bitty components that cause backlight

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
bitty components that cause backlight
issues<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.990> after<00:00:31.560> watching<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.250> YouTube

issues and after watching some YouTube
videos<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.690> try<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> new<00:00:35.309> LCD<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.000> if

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
videos you can try for a new LCD and if

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.979 
videos you can try for a new LCD and if
that<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.230> work<00:00:37.640> then<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:39.149> problem<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that does not work then your problem is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350 
that does not work then your problem is
these<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:41.190> chips<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.850> there's<00:00:42.059> two

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
these little chips here there's two

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
these little chips here there's two
chips<00:00:42.829> inside<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> iPad<00:00:44.340> Mini<00:00:44.520> let<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.760> put<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
chips inside the iPad Mini let me put a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
chips inside the iPad Mini let me put a
little<00:00:45.030> magnifying<00:00:45.660> glass<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.530> we

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
little magnifying glass over this so we

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.310 
little magnifying glass over this so we
can<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.910> better

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
can kind of see this a little bit better

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
can kind of see this a little bit better
alright<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.120> chip<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
alright so your first chip is your

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.869 
alright so your first chip is your
backlight<00:00:53.570> chip<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.199> here

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
backlight chip which is right here

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.090 
backlight chip which is right here
but<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.570> major<00:00:57.809> causes<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.440> problems<00:00:58.890> guys

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but the major causes these problems guys

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.270 
but the major causes these problems guys
is<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> there's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> seven<00:01:01.289> three<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.500> two

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is the one there's a seven three one two

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460 
is the one there's a seven three one two
three<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.660> middle<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
three right in the middle right there

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.429 
three right in the middle right there
that<00:01:05.250> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> blacked<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that kind of blacked out one that is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
that kind of blacked out one that is
your<00:01:07.770> backlight<00:01:08.280> fuse<00:01:08.930> which<00:01:09.930> controls<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
your backlight fuse which controls the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
your backlight fuse which controls the
backlight<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.280> mine<00:01:11.610> doesn't<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.299> good

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
backlight now mine doesn't look too good

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
backlight now mine doesn't look too good
there<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.020> did<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> multimeter<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
there I did put a multimeter to it and I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.679 
there I did put a multimeter to it and I
did<00:01:15.600> register<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.479> maybe<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
did register a little bit so maybe the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.580 
did register a little bit so maybe the
water<00:01:18.930> caused<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.600> blow<00:01:21.600> halfway<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> don't

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
water caused it to blow halfway I don't

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.670 
water caused it to blow halfway I don't
know<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.460> put<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.299> new<00:01:24.450> LCD<00:01:24.900> screen<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
know but I put on my new LCD screen and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.179 
know but I put on my new LCD screen and
my<00:01:26.520> Apple<00:01:27.240> logo<00:01:27.420> comes<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> can't<00:01:29.070> even

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
my Apple logo comes up but I can't even

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.560 
my Apple logo comes up but I can't even
see<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.579> unless<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> flashlight

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
see it unless I have a flashlight

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.520 
see it unless I have a flashlight

pointing at the screen so if you are a
good<00:01:34.799> solder<00:01:35.130> guys<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> component

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
good solder guys this is the component

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630 
good solder guys this is the component
you're<00:01:37.290> looking<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.610> in

that's a little too small for me those

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.289 
that's a little too small for me those
components<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.360> tiny<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> again<00:01:56.790> guys<00:01:57.000> I'm

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
components are tiny so again guys I'm

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
components are tiny so again guys I'm
gonna<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> guy<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:59.009> report
