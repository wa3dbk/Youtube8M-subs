that we saw this new trailer I'm

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
that we saw this new trailer I'm
assuming<00:01:11.850> he<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.060> fly<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.570> drones<00:01:12.990> can

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
assuming he can fly because drones can

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
assuming he can fly because drones can
fly<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.880> laser<00:01:15.150> beam<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.420> don't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fly but this this laser beam I don't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.560 
fly but this this laser beam I don't
know<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.710> seems<00:01:17.009> deadly<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> don't

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know what it is it seems deadly I don't

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
know what it is it seems deadly I don't
I'm<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:18.900> sure<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:20.040> interesting<00:01:20.340> though

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I'm not sure it's interesting though

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
I'm not sure it's interesting though
because<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.909> might<00:01:21.180> only<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.659> scraping<00:01:22.110> the

because we might only be scraping the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
because we might only be scraping the
surface<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:23.030> what<00:01:24.030> he's<00:01:24.180> capable<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.500> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
surface on what he's capable of but one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to see the full scene but one thing I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
to see the full scene but one thing I
noticed<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.159> Hulk's<00:01:50.820> eyes<00:01:51.000> were<00:01:51.479> very

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
noticed is that Hulk's eyes were very

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.499 
noticed is that Hulk's eyes were very
red<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.710> assuming<00:01:53.040> he's<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.460> hungover<00:01:53.850> from

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
red I'm assuming he's not hungover from

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
red I'm assuming he's not hungover from
partying<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.170> literally<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> end<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
partying like it's literally the end of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
partying like it's literally the end of
the<00:01:55.979> world<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.460> might<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.270> now<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the world because it might be but now I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.830 
the world because it might be but now I
think<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:59.210> he<00:02:00.210> might<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.479> under<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.659> control

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
think that he might be under the control

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560 
think that he might be under the control
of<00:02:01.140> scarlet<00:02:01.590> witch<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.820> means<00:02:03.030> Scarlet

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
of scarlet witch so that means Scarlet

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.010 
of scarlet witch so that means Scarlet
Witch<00:02:03.659> who<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.229> working<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.340> Holt<00:02:05.520> Ron<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
Witch who is working for Holt Ron is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
Witch who is working for Holt Ron is
taking<00:02:07.020> control<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.310> Hulk<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> pitting

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
taking control of the Hulk and pitting

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.309 
taking control of the Hulk and pitting
him<00:02:09.090> against<00:02:09.390> his<00:02:09.450> friends<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> Avengers

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
him against his friends the Avengers

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.619 
him against his friends the Avengers
that's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.220> crazy<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.390> how<00:02:12.480> that
