00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the copper wire inside the copper wire

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.860 
the copper wire inside the copper wire
gives<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.460> strength<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.120> rubber

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
any responsibilities for that just use

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.999 
any responsibilities for that just use
it<00:02:06.400> thoughtfully<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.259> need<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.710> ring

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it thoughtfully then you need to ring

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.730 
it thoughtfully then you need to ring
terminals<00:02:09.750> after<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.899> have<00:02:10.930> attached<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979

put<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.160> wire<00:02:14.400> through<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.239> ring<00:02:15.420> terminal

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
put the wire through the ring terminal

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.290 
put the wire through the ring terminal
after<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.860> put<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.280> wire<00:02:17.459> through<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.940> one

after you put the wire through the one
ring<00:02:18.599> terminal<00:02:19.110> attach<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.130> ring<00:02:20.310> terminal

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
ring terminal attach the ring terminal

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.690 
ring terminal attach the ring terminal
at<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> other<00:02:21.360> wire<00:02:21.660> end<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.890> prevents<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
at the other wire end this prevents the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
at the other wire end this prevents the
loop<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.330> opened<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.349> loop<00:02:25.530> stays<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
loop to be opened so the loop stays a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.570 
loop to be opened so the loop stays a
loop<00:02:26.780> another<00:02:27.780> advantage<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.950> loop<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
loop another advantage of the loop is

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.990 
loop another advantage of the loop is
that<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.269> tightens<00:02:30.780> itself<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.610> your

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that it tightens itself so if your

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.390 
that it tightens itself so if your
action<00:02:33.390> cam<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.900> being<00:02:34.200> lost<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.099> force

action cam is being lost and the force

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.240 
action cam is being lost and the force
is<00:02:35.700> applied<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.569> end<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.470> loop<00:02:37.680> tightens

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
is applied to this end the loop tightens

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.490 
is applied to this end the loop tightens

in this video you need the same rubber

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
in this video you need the same rubber
cable<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.959> before<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> ring<00:02:50.040> terminals

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
put the thumb screw of the GoPro through

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.110 
put the thumb screw of the GoPro through
it<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:57.600> end<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.319> attached<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> GoPro<00:02:59.640> the

ends of the leash are attached at the
thumbscrew<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.760> helmet<00:03:06.150> screw<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.900> I'm

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
thumbscrew and the helmet screw so I'm

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.170 
thumbscrew and the helmet screw so I'm
calling<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.650> screw<00:03:08.099> leash<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
calling this a screw leash this is a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.630 
calling this a screw leash this is a
very<00:03:09.450> tight<00:03:09.900> connection<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> helmet<00:03:11.549> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
very tight connection to the helmet and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.240 
very tight connection to the helmet and
a<00:03:11.880> very<00:03:12.090> tight<00:03:12.390> connection<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> GoPro<00:03:13.650> so

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
a very tight connection to the GoPro so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
a very tight connection to the GoPro so
just<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.730> case<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.269> adhesive<00:03:15.810> mount<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
just in case the adhesive mount is

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.410 
just in case the adhesive mount is
losing<00:03:16.590> contact<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.190> helmet<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.180> won't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
losing contact to the helmet you won't

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.479 
losing contact to the helmet you won't
lose<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:18.750> action<00:03:19.380> cam<00:03:19.590> because<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.310> leash

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
lose your action cam because the leash

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.630 
lose your action cam because the leash
will<00:03:20.820> hold<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.299> at<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.570> helmet<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.130> wherever

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
will hold it at the helmet so wherever

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.849 
will hold it at the helmet so wherever
you're<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.660> your<00:03:24.870> action<00:03:25.380> cam<00:03:25.590> it's

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
you're going with your action cam it's

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.340 
you're going with your action cam it's
very<00:03:26.070> hard<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.430> lose<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.630> recording<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
very hard to lose it if the recording of

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.259 
very hard to lose it if the recording of
the<00:03:28.500> sound<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:29.010> important<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.819> then<00:03:30.090> be

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
the sound is important to you then be

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.840 
the sound is important to you then be
sure<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.510> tape<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.260> leash<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.980> helmet<00:03:32.430> to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
sure to tape the leash to the helmet to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.630 
sure to tape the leash to the helmet to
avoid<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> dangling<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.109> wind<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.739> hope<00:03:35.430> you

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
avoid a dangling in the wind I hope you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.699 
avoid a dangling in the wind I hope you
