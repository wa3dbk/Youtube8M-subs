00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.460
 in the cities of india it is possible to see 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.080
 to a large number of animals many of 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.299
 they are sacred to religion 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.799
 Hinduist and some are frequently 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.799
 represented as gods 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.789
 hanuman the monkey 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.000
 win the elephant 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.730
 or accompanying gods like chivas 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.900
 also according to this religion the animals 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.940
 they are part of the cycle of 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.340
 reincarnations with which any 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.300
 person may have been being animal in 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.300
 past or future lives 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.800
 among them all, the queen no doubt 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.810
 some is the cow the most sacred animal 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.940
 that goes through the streets 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.380
 alleys and roads across the country 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.380
 without being disturbed 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.620
 but because the cows are sacred the 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.540
 religious concept is possibly very 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.190
 linked to the practical reality of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 economy and human needs of the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.360
 india listen to our friend slobber 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.680
 sivananda 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.870
 cows means go all drink milk 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.870
 cow 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.550
 That means therefore I die die the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.200
 cows do not have milk as 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.710
 and I say everything I die I can not 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.710
 alternate 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.240
 In addition to offering daily 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.369
 essential milk butter and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.140
 cottage cheese cows have many other 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.479
 advantages in a country with high density of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.390
 population among others allow 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.040
 there are oxen to cultivate the fields 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 their sun-dried droppings and 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.340
 converted into fuel save 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.649
 tens of millions of tons of 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.700
 wood per year in addition to being used as 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.700
 pavement in many homes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.040
 On the other hand they do not have costs of 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.570
 maintenance since they feed on 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.760
 the vegetable leftovers of the cities 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.750
 thus easing the process of collecting 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.530
 waste in summary is very efficient 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.270
 especially in a society 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 mostly vegetarian 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.930
 other animals coexist peacefully 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.520
 with man and cows or almost the most 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.080
 fast the monkeys can steal the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.140
 luggage of a clueless tourist and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 make it disappear in the heights 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.180
 heights they share with squirrels 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.430
 and the sludge 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.000
 the buffalo go to the river to bathe as 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000
 all the world 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.300
 the rocks can be good companions 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.740
 of snack donkeys camels and goats 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
 they are also part of the urban fauna 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.680
 as well as the main managers of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.689
 cleaning the pigs 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.019
 near the river the beautiful kingfisher 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:54.160
 fisherman and inside in the swaps with a lot 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.170
 luck it is possible to see dolphins 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.940
 they all coexist peacefully in the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.940
 cities like these two friends 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.470
 equal to equal
