into thinking how we would make this
crowd<00:02:12.830> interesting

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.209 

we<00:02:16.760> invented<00:02:17.239> this<00:02:17.390> all<00:02:17.629> brand<00:02:18.170> new<00:02:18.349> character

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
we invented this all brand new character

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.339 
we invented this all brand new character
based<00:02:19.549> on<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.849> assassins<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:21.049> we<00:02:21.200> also

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
based on the assassins but we also

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.660 
based on the assassins but we also
wanted<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.829> give<00:02:22.040> him<00:02:22.159> a<00:02:22.250> look<00:02:22.459> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
wanted to give him a look and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.660 
wanted to give him a look and
personality<00:02:22.879> all<00:02:23.659> of<00:02:24.109> his<00:02:24.230> own<00:02:24.439> so<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.459> first

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
personality all of his own so the first

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.759 
personality all of his own so the first
reflection<00:02:26.299> was<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.750> terms<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.109> gameplay<00:02:27.379> our

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
reflection was in terms of gameplay our

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.130 
reflection was in terms of gameplay our
core<00:02:28.099> gameplay<00:02:28.340> loop<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.870> assassin

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
core gameplay loop what is the assassin

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.080 
core gameplay loop what is the assassin
doing<00:02:30.739> most<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.129> time<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.819> what<00:02:31.970> you're

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
doing most of the time but what you're

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.300 
doing most of the time but what you're
doing<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.480> you're<00:02:32.590> investigating<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.129> you're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
doing is you're investigating so you're

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.880 
doing is you're investigating so you're
mapping<00:02:35.000> out<00:02:35.329> your<00:02:35.359> territory<00:02:36.049> really<00:02:36.590> trying

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
mapping out your territory really trying

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.979 
mapping out your territory really trying
to<00:02:36.920> pinpoint<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.760> locate<00:02:38.180> your<00:02:38.359> prey<00:02:38.720> and

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
to pinpoint and locate your prey and

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.379 
to pinpoint and locate your prey and
then<00:02:39.470> once<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.829> focus<00:02:40.099> in<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.519> your<00:02:40.639> prey<00:02:40.939> you

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
then once you focus in on your prey you

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.259 
then once you focus in on your prey you
go<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.349> quickly<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.129> kill<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.670> then<00:02:44.120> you

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
go in quickly for the kill and then you

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.569 
go in quickly for the kill and then you
get<00:02:44.480> out<00:02:44.719> of<00:02:44.750> there<00:02:45.139> and<00:02:45.319> when<00:02:46.129> we<00:02:46.280> thought<00:02:46.549> of

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
get out of there and when we thought of

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.099 
get out of there and when we thought of
what<00:02:47.090> you're<00:02:47.209> doing<00:02:47.239> most<00:02:47.659> tongue<00:02:47.870> as<00:02:47.989> an

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
what you're doing most tongue as an

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.289 
what you're doing most tongue as an
assassin<00:02:48.319> made<00:02:49.069> us<00:02:49.189> think<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.879> bird<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.239> prey

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
assassin made us think of a bird of prey

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.780 
assassin made us think of a bird of prey
so<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.470> became<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.859> inspiration<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.639> out

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
so that became the inspiration for out

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.559 
so that became the inspiration for out
hair<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.389> in<00:02:53.780> fact<00:02:54.019> out<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.560> year<00:02:55.010> means<00:02:55.939> flying

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
hair and in fact out a year means flying

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.289 
hair and in fact out a year means flying
eagle<00:02:57.169> or<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:58.010> flyer<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.730> Arabic<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:02.120> you

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
eagle or the flyer in Arabic if you

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.210 
eagle or the flyer in Arabic if you
notice<00:03:02.569> he's<00:03:02.720> wearing<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:03.079> hood<00:03:03.319> which<00:03:03.919> has<00:03:04.189> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
notice he's wearing a hood which has a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.970 
notice he's wearing a hood which has a
little<00:03:04.549> point<00:03:04.849> in<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> front<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.689> he<00:03:06.409> has<00:03:06.680> a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
little point in the front and he has a

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.129 
little point in the front and he has a
robe<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.819> kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.239> splits<00:03:08.689> out<00:03:08.870> on<00:03:09.019> the

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
robe that kind of splits out on the

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.069 
robe that kind of splits out on the
sides<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:10.370> he's<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.849> movement<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.599> size

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
sides and when he's in movement the size

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.289 
sides and when he's in movement the size
flip<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.919> and<00:03:13.189> if<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.489> were<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.639> look<00:03:13.760> at<00:03:14.120> a

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
flip up and if you were to look at a

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.659 
flip up and if you were to look at a
shadow<00:03:14.989> cast<00:03:15.319> from<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.650> side<00:03:15.859> of<00:03:16.040> him<00:03:16.250> you'd

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
shadow cast from the side of him you'd

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.580 
shadow cast from the side of him you'd
get<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.000> angle<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.569> point<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.379> hood

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
get the angle of the point of the hood

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.309 
get the angle of the point of the hood
and<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.519> sides<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.599> skirt<00:03:20.840> flapping

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
and then the sides of the skirt flapping

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.500 
and then the sides of the skirt flapping
up<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.650> you'd<00:03:22.190> get<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.549> shadow<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:22.940> an<00:03:23.180> eagle

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
up and you'd get the shadow of an eagle

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.819 
up and you'd get the shadow of an eagle
so<00:03:24.079> Altair<00:03:24.590> really<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> bird<00:03:25.609> of<00:03:25.699> prey<00:03:26.829> that
