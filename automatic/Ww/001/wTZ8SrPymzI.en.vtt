so you also then have the ability to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630 
so you also then have the ability to
load<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.320> client<00:00:37.860> application<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.610> a

data group to give us the ability to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
data group to give us the ability to
navigate<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.200> couple<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> different

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
objects in the navigation tree here so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
objects in the navigation tree here so
first<00:01:15.360> thing<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> we're

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
first thing that we can do or that we're

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.679 
first thing that we can do or that we're
going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
going to do here is we are going to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.070 
going to do here is we are going to
expand<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> i/o<00:01:20.299> object<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
expand the i/o object and we have a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.630 
expand the i/o object and we have a
couple<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> items<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
couple of items here that we can take a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.260 
couple of items here that we can take a
look<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.330> live<00:01:24.869> view<00:01:25.020> session<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.270> really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
look at a live view session is a really

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.969 
look at a live view session is a really
useful<00:01:28.369> application<00:01:29.369> within<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.820> CNH<00:01:30.150> queue

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
useful application within the CNH queue

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.469 
useful application within the CNH queue
program<00:01:31.979> where<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> click<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> add<00:01:33.450> new

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
program where we can click on add new

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.260 
program where we can click on add new
session<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.060> target<00:01:36.659> let's<00:01:37.229> say<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
session and we can target let's say a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.469 
session and we can target let's say a
volume<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> array<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.030> case<00:01:42.090> we'll

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
volume on the array in this case we'll

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.980 
volume on the array in this case we'll
use<00:01:42.720> demo<00:01:43.079> 1<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.990> particular

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
use demo 1 or we can do a particular

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
use demo 1 or we can do a particular
member<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.250> compress<00:01:47.670> play

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
member if we like and we compress play

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
member if we like and we compress play
and<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> allow<00:01:49.560> us<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> monitor

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
and that's going to allow us to monitor

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.539 
and that's going to allow us to monitor
the<00:01:50.729> activity<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.950> right

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the activity of what is going on right

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.069 
the activity of what is going on right
now<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.479> bringing<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> new

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
now so if we're bringing on a new

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
now so if we're bringing on a new
application<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.030> load

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
application or we want to do some load

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.420 
application or we want to do some load
testing<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.770> information<00:01:59.040> about

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
testing we can get information about

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.929 
testing we can get information about
what's<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:01.170> live<00:02:01.950> view<00:02:02.490> session

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.760 
what's going on with live view session
I'm<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:03.930> ahead<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.320> stop<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.540> and

going<00:06:33.990> to<00:06:34.110> be<00:06:34.230> incredibly<00:06:35.010> exciting<00:06:35.430> because

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
going to be incredibly exciting because

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.330 
going to be incredibly exciting because
it<00:06:36.120> is<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.240> lab<00:06:36.480> environment<00:06:37.140> and<00:06:37.320> so<00:06:38.010> we<00:06:38.160> don't

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
it is a lab environment and so we don't

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.600 
it is a lab environment and so we don't
have<00:06:38.550> a<00:06:38.610> whole<00:06:38.880> lot<00:06:39.090> going<00:06:39.120> on<00:06:39.540> so<00:06:40.430> but<00:06:41.430> we

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
have a whole lot going on so but we

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.760 
have a whole lot going on so but we
would<00:06:41.850> get<00:06:42.120> a<00:06:42.390> lot<00:06:42.810> more<00:06:43.050> information<00:06:43.320> about

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
would get a lot more information about

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.900 
would get a lot more information about
the<00:06:43.920> environment<00:06:44.700> if<00:06:44.850> it<00:06:45.450> was<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.660> production

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
the environment if it was a production

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.800 
the environment if it was a production
group<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:50.520> we<00:06:50.670> did<00:06:50.820> the<00:06:50.910> reporting<00:06:51.390> against

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
group that we did the reporting against

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.930 
group that we did the reporting against
