grams<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> serving<00:01:45.780> size<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
grams so the serving size has actually a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.929 
grams so the serving size has actually a
bit<00:01:47.310> larger<00:01:47.850> than<00:01:48.119> typical<00:01:49.049> proteins<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
bit larger than typical proteins so the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
bit larger than typical proteins so the
the<00:01:51.869> ramen<00:01:52.170> scoop<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.680> 50<00:01:53.009> grams<00:01:53.250> there's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the ramen scoop is in 50 grams there's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
the ramen scoop is in 50 grams there's
26<00:01:54.030> servings<00:01:54.479> per<00:01:54.509> container<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
26 servings per container this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.270 
26 servings per container this
particular<00:01:57.590> table<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> 2.9<00:01:59.310> pounds<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
particular table is 2.9 pounds so the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.660 
particular table is 2.9 pounds so the
calories<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.119> 50<00:02:03.570> gram<00:02:03.750> serving<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.670> 215

calories and the 50 gram serving is 215

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.199 
calories and the 50 gram serving is 215
there's<00:02:06.000> 7<00:02:06.540> grams<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> fat<00:02:07.340> 13<00:02:08.340> grams<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.789> carbs

there's 7 grams of fat 13 grams of carbs

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.619 
there's 7 grams of fat 13 grams of carbs
and<00:02:09.450> 4<00:02:10.020> grams<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.410> dietary<00:02:10.530> fiber<00:02:11.270> 3<00:02:12.270> grams<00:02:12.510> of

in<00:02:13.520> 25<00:02:14.520> grams<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.910> protein<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:16.320> most<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.830> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
in 25 grams of protein so most of you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
in 25 grams of protein so most of you
maybe<00:02:17.100> maybe<00:02:17.490> thinking<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.140> pretty

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
maybe maybe thinking that it's a pretty

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.750 
maybe maybe thinking that it's a pretty
high<00:02:20.100> calorie<00:02:20.790> high<00:02:20.820> fat<00:02:21.800> content<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.730> a

high calorie high fat content for a

high calorie high fat content for a
serving<00:02:24.300> size<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.930> when<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.170> actually

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
serving size but when you actually

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.220 
serving size but when you actually
calculate<00:02:26.280> what<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.540> compared

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
calculate what it would be like compared

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
calculate what it would be like compared
to<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> 34<00:02:29.220> grams<00:02:29.430> serving<00:02:29.850> size<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.270> say<00:02:30.510> aqua

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
to a 34 grams serving size of say aqua

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.600 
to a 34 grams serving size of say aqua
Nutrition<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.860> pour<00:02:32.130> anything<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.580> that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
Nutrition so you pour anything like that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.350 
Nutrition so you pour anything like that
the<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.890> numbers<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.370> pretty<00:02:35.550> similar<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the the numbers are pretty similar so

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240 
the the numbers are pretty similar so
don't<00:02:36.750> freak<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.220> has

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
don't freak out when you see that it has

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.960 
don't freak out when you see that it has
215<00:02:39.030> calories<00:02:39.450> 7<00:02:40.140> grams<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.470> fat<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
215 calories 7 grams of fat and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
215 calories 7 grams of fat and
everything<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.540> calculated<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> out

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
everything like that I calculated it out

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.910 
everything like that I calculated it out
to<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.570> 146<00:02:45.570> calories<00:02:46.190> versus<00:02:47.420> 130<00:02:48.420> 135<00:02:49.050> so

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
to be 146 calories versus 130 135 so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.479 
to be 146 calories versus 130 135 so
they're<00:02:50.220> around<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.760> same<00:02:50.970> area<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.170> you

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
they're around the same area so you

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.940 
they're around the same area so you
really<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.520> going<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.209> same<00:02:54.420> thing

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
really are going to get the same thing

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.690 
really are going to get the same thing
and<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:57.390> thing<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:57.959> almost<00:02:58.800> really

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and the thing that really almost really

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.020 
and the thing that really almost really
surprised<00:03:00.120> me<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:02.190> protein

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
surprised me is that this this protein

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.290 
surprised me is that this this protein
actually<00:03:03.300> has<00:03:04.700> their<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.150> their

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
actually has their they have their

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.479 
actually has their they have their
omega-3<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.930> omega-6<00:03:07.260> fatty<00:03:07.739> acids<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.810 
omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in the
actual<00:03:08.850> protein<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.690> you're<00:03:10.700> someone<00:03:11.700> that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
actual protein so if you're someone that

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.290 
actual protein so if you're someone that
really<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.450> into<00:03:13.880> proteins<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:15.090> lower

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
really is into proteins with lower

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.050 
really is into proteins with lower
calories<00:03:15.840> you're<00:03:16.050> into<00:03:16.320> isolates<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.250> lot<00:03:17.430> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
calories you're into isolates a lot you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.270 
calories you're into isolates a lot you
really<00:03:18.090> would<00:03:18.480> want<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.959> go<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.620> those<00:03:19.860> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
really would want to go for those and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.000 
really would want to go for those and
and<00:03:21.150> not<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.080> protein<00:03:22.709> is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
and not for this this protein is

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.800 
and not for this this protein is
definitely<00:03:23.790> gonna<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.269> somebody<00:03:24.600> that's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
definitely gonna be for somebody that's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.050 
definitely gonna be for somebody that's
a<00:03:24.930> first-time<00:03:25.440> protein<00:03:25.830> user<00:03:26.040> or<00:03:26.519> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
a first-time protein user or a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.060 
a first-time protein user or a
recreational<00:03:27.780> gym<00:03:27.840> goer<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.590> really<00:03:28.860> needs

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
recreational gym goer that really needs

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.660 
recreational gym goer that really needs
to<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.430> more<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.810> their<00:03:31.530> Omega<00:03:31.799> 3<00:03:32.010> Omega<00:03:32.070> 6s

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
to get more of their Omega 3 Omega 6s

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.580 
to get more of their Omega 3 Omega 6s
and<00:03:32.940> even<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.390> fiber<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.930> their<00:03:34.080> diet<00:03:34.110> so

that's not really used to getting a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.000 
that's not really used to getting a
well-rounded<00:03:39.720> diet<00:03:40.110> that's<00:03:40.709> why<00:03:40.950> this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
well-rounded diet that's why this

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.000 
well-rounded diet that's why this
product<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:41.760> great<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.890> think<00:03:43.890> it's

product is so great I think it's

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.430 
product is so great I think it's
fantastic<00:03:44.970> for<00:03:45.540> people<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.200> aren't

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
fantastic for people that just aren't

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.280 
fantastic for people that just aren't
into<00:03:47.180> eating<00:03:48.180> their<00:03:48.390> fruit<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.810> vegetables

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
into eating their fruit and vegetables

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
into eating their fruit and vegetables
and<00:03:49.530> they're<00:03:49.620> not<00:03:49.739> used<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.150> said<00:03:51.330> a

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
and they're not used to like I said a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.600 
and they're not used to like I said a
well-rounded<00:03:51.660> diet<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.320> that's<00:03:53.130> what<00:03:53.400> whoo<00:03:53.549> I

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
well-rounded diet so that's what whoo I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.650 
well-rounded diet so that's what whoo I
would<00:03:54.030> first<00:03:54.299> recommend<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:56.190> overall<00:03:56.850> I

would first recommend this to overall I
actually<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.860> made<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> quite<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> few<00:03:59.400> things

actually have made a quite a few things

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.250 
actually have made a quite a few things
with<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.360> move<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.080> the

with it I'm going to move on to the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.650 
with it I'm going to move on to the
versatility<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:02.310> makes<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.790> very<00:04:03.060> very<00:04:03.330> very

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
one of those things that I went back to

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.760 
one of those things that I went back to
immediately<00:05:05.730> when<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> did<00:05:06.300> get<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.230> and<00:05:07.590> I

immediately when I did get this and I
did<00:05:07.950> try<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:08.670> if<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.420> love<00:05:09.690> chocolate<00:05:09.720> and

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
thought of chocolate See's candy when I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.450 
thought of chocolate See's candy when I
tried<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.140> too<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.920> get<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.130> lot<00:05:20.340> of

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
tried it too so you get a lot of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.960 
tried it too so you get a lot of
different<00:05:21.050> tastes<00:05:22.050> from<00:05:22.290> it<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.770> will<00:05:23.460> say<00:05:23.700> that

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
different tastes from it I will say that

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.600 
different tastes from it I will say that
with<00:05:24.120> this<00:05:24.270> protein<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:25.470> tastes<00:05:25.980> exactly<00:05:26.070> good

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
with this protein it tastes exactly good

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.980 
with this protein it tastes exactly good
smells<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:27.210> know<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.390> lot<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.630> different

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
smells I know a lot of different

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.490 
smells I know a lot of different
proteins<00:05:28.380> are<00:05:28.770> differently<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:30.510> can<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:31.080> don't

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
proteins are differently you can I don't

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.300 
proteins are differently you can I don't
know<00:05:31.590> for<00:05:31.860> example<00:05:31.890> you<00:05:32.250> get<00:05:32.430> like<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.640> vanilla

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
know for example you get like a vanilla

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.770 
know for example you get like a vanilla
that<00:05:35.310> makes<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.640> smell<00:05:35.880> like<00:05:35.970> cake<00:05:36.150> batter<00:05:36.330> you

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
that makes it smell like cake batter you

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.360 
that makes it smell like cake batter you
know<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.620> actually<00:05:37.950> tastes<00:05:38.190> like<00:05:38.280> a

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
know but it actually tastes like a

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.070 
know but it actually tastes like a
vanilla<00:05:38.640> ice<00:05:38.850> cream<00:05:39.090> you<00:05:39.330> know<00:05:39.360> if<00:05:39.630> there's<00:05:39.990> a

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
vanilla ice cream you know if there's a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.590 
vanilla ice cream you know if there's a
lot<00:05:40.260> of<00:05:40.380> different<00:05:41.220> reactions<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.090> stuff<00:05:42.390> you

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
lot of different reactions and stuff you

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.900 
lot of different reactions and stuff you
get<00:05:42.780> with<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:42.960> but<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:44.280> tastes<00:05:44.760> exactly

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
get with that but this tastes exactly

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.180 
get with that but this tastes exactly

out of it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.500 
out of it
apart<00:06:03.750> from<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:03.960> I<00:06:04.470> will<00:06:05.010> say<00:06:05.310> though<00:06:05.580> that

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
apart from that I will say though that

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.060 
apart from that I will say though that
my<00:06:06.720> liver<00:06:06.900> allfox<00:06:07.320> I<00:06:07.530> made<00:06:07.650> I'm<00:06:07.770> going<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.950> rate

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
my liver allfox I made I'm going to rate

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.190 
my liver allfox I made I'm going to rate
it<00:06:08.100> an<00:06:08.310> 8<00:06:08.460> out<00:06:08.490> of<00:06:08.640> 10

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
it an 8 out of 10

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.560 
it an 8 out of 10
basically<00:06:10.200> because<00:06:10.500> I<00:06:10.980> am<00:06:11.820> currently<00:06:12.060> dieting

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
basically because I am currently dieting

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.480 
basically because I am currently dieting
so<00:06:12.600> I'm<00:06:12.810> looking<00:06:13.110> for<00:06:13.260> a<00:06:13.290> little

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
so I'm looking for a little

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.089 
so I'm looking for a little
with<00:06:13.639> lower<00:06:13.849> of<00:06:14.120> calories<00:06:14.630> and<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.590> do<00:06:15.650> get

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
with lower of calories and I do get

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.939 
with lower of calories and I do get
sufficient<00:06:16.759> fiber<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:17.660> sufficient<00:06:18.410> omega-3

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
sufficient fiber and sufficient omega-3

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.830 
sufficient fiber and sufficient omega-3
and<00:06:19.039> omega-6<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.729> from<00:06:19.940> different<00:06:20.240> sources<00:06:20.539> so

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
and omega-6 is from different sources so

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.110 
and omega-6 is from different sources so
therefore<00:06:21.319> I<00:06:21.560> wouldn't<00:06:22.310> use<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> ton<00:06:22.849> of<00:06:22.880> this

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
therefore I wouldn't use a ton of this

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.629 
therefore I wouldn't use a ton of this
in<00:06:23.389> my<00:06:23.539> recipes<00:06:24.080> I<00:06:24.380> wouldn't<00:06:25.039> use<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.160> ton<00:06:25.460> of<00:06:25.490> it

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
in my recipes I wouldn't use a ton of it

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.879 
in my recipes I wouldn't use a ton of it
any<00:06:26.210> probably<00:06:27.080> wouldn't<00:06:27.349> use<00:06:27.380> more<00:06:27.710> than<00:06:27.860> a

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
any probably wouldn't use more than a

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.559 
any probably wouldn't use more than a
scoop<00:06:28.220> or<00:06:28.370> two<00:06:28.430> scoops<00:06:28.880> a<00:06:29.000> day<00:06:29.150> just<00:06:29.449> because

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
scoop or two scoops a day just because

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:35.200 
scoop or two scoops a day just because
it<00:06:29.900> is<00:06:30.050> a<00:06:30.259> very<00:06:31.419> very<00:06:32.419> high<00:06:33.410> calorie<00:06:34.180> not<00:06:35.180> a

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
it is a very very high calorie not a

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.370 
it is a very very high calorie not a
very<00:06:35.449> high<00:06:35.569> calorie<00:06:35.900> but<00:06:36.110> a<00:06:36.139> pretty

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
very high calorie but a pretty

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.159 
very high calorie but a pretty
moderately<00:06:37.099> high<00:06:37.220> calorie<00:06:37.840> protein<00:06:38.840> powder

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
moderately high calorie protein powder

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.040 
moderately high calorie protein powder
so<00:06:39.560> overall<00:06:40.009> I'd<00:06:40.250> recommend<00:06:40.729> this<00:06:40.849> to<00:06:41.240> like<00:06:41.900> I

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
so overall I'd recommend this to like I

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.050 
so overall I'd recommend this to like I
said<00:06:42.259> earlier<00:06:42.620> anybody<00:06:43.190> that<00:06:43.430> doesn't<00:06:43.819> get

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
said earlier anybody that doesn't get

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.570 
said earlier anybody that doesn't get
their<00:06:44.300> omega-3<00:06:44.780> omega-6<00:06:45.110> is<00:06:45.410> from<00:06:45.680> third<00:06:46.250> diet

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
their omega-3 omega-6 is from third diet

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.850 
their omega-3 omega-6 is from third diet
it<00:06:46.940> doesn't<00:06:46.970> get<00:06:47.300> sufficient<00:06:47.449> fiber<00:06:47.960> someone

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
it doesn't get sufficient fiber someone

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.040 
it doesn't get sufficient fiber someone
that<00:06:48.979> just<00:06:49.370> goes<00:06:49.580> to<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:49.880> gym<00:06:50.120> a<00:06:50.419> few<00:06:50.539> days<00:06:50.900> out
