00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
start right there here's what I'm doing
it's<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> simplest<00:01:31.619> way<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> fish<00:01:32.550> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

I know of and in fact I think most
people<00:01:34.860> learn<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> fish<00:01:35.580> with<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> these

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
people learn to fish with one of these

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
people learn to fish with one of these
tight<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> other<00:01:36.840> end<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
tight on the other end it's just a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.680 
tight on the other end it's just a
simple<00:01:38.160> Indy<00:01:38.430> jig<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.180> doing<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
is I'm throwing a sixteenth ounce jig
and<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.240> pitching<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.530> one

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and I'm pitching that in there but one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
and I'm pitching that in there but one
of<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.950> keys<00:01:44.220> today<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.210> letting<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
of the keys today is I'm not letting it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
of the keys today is I'm not letting it
constantly<00:01:46.320> hit<00:01:46.590> bottom<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:47.160> actually

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
constantly hit bottom I'm actually

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
constantly hit bottom I'm actually
swimming<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.509> back<00:01:48.690> now<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.200> go

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
swimming this thing back now you can go

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
swimming this thing back now you can go
one<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:49.649> ways<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.580> use<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> plastic<00:01:51.030> or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
one of two ways you can use a plastic or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
one of two ways you can use a plastic or
you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.690> do<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:51.990> doing<00:01:52.140> today<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you can do it I'm doing today and use a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
you can do it I'm doing today and use a
middle<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> lot<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> times<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.660> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
middle and I think a lot of times it can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.730 
middle and I think a lot of times it can
make<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> huge<00:01:55.020> difference

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
make a huge difference

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.260 
make a huge difference
earlier<00:01:56.009> today<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.340> ran<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.610> plastic<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
earlier today I ran a plastic for a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
earlier today I ran a plastic for a
little<00:01:57.479> bit<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.720> never<00:01:57.899> got<00:01:58.050> touched<00:01:58.380> then

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
little bit and I never got touched then

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.650 
little bit and I never got touched then
I<00:01:58.710> missed<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.130> couple<00:01:59.280> fish<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> minnow<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
I missed a couple fish on a minnow so it

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.030 
I missed a couple fish on a minnow so it
told<00:02:00.840> me<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.140> away<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:01.770> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
told me right away that they were really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
told me right away that they were really
keyed<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.729> bait<00:02:02.940> one<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.720> things

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
keyed in on that bait one of the things

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.270 
keyed in on that bait one of the things
that<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> difference<00:02:04.860> though<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that will make a difference though is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
that will make a difference though is
when<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.940> water<00:02:06.150> is<00:02:06.360> cold<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> still<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
when the water is cold like it still is

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.380 
when the water is cold like it still is

lot of these fish in but they're not
really<00:03:27.530> tuned<00:03:28.040> up<00:03:28.340> into<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.850> spawn<00:03:29.150> yet<00:03:29.360> you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
really tuned up into the spawn yet you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.600 
really tuned up into the spawn yet you
can<00:03:29.690> see<00:03:29.960> that<00:03:30.650> these<00:03:30.800> are<00:03:30.860> all<00:03:31.100> pre<00:03:31.340> spawn

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
can see that these are all pre spawn

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730 
can see that these are all pre spawn
fish<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.120> these<00:03:32.210> males<00:03:32.510> aren't<00:03:33.140> milking<00:03:33.560> yet

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
fish and these males aren't milking yet

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.830 
fish and these males aren't milking yet
so<00:03:34.250> they're<00:03:34.430> sitting<00:03:34.760> out<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.270> little<00:03:35.300> bit

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
so they're sitting out just a little bit

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.020 
so they're sitting out just a little bit
off<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.050> edge<00:03:36.350> now<00:03:36.620> as<00:03:37.220> soon<00:03:37.340> as<00:03:37.460> we<00:03:37.640> get<00:03:37.790> just

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
off the edge now as soon as we get just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.730 
off the edge now as soon as we get just
a<00:03:38.120> couple<00:03:38.390> more<00:03:38.720> degrees<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.200> water<00:03:39.380> temple

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
a couple more degrees in water temple

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.020 
a couple more degrees in water temple
it's<00:03:39.890> gonna<00:03:39.980> happen<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.460> these<00:03:40.640> fish<00:03:40.880> are

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
it's gonna happen is these fish are

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.730 
it's gonna happen is these fish are
gonna<00:03:41.120> rush<00:03:41.390> right<00:03:41.720> up<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.020> top<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.260> them<00:03:42.500> rocks

and I had actually kind of stopped my
bait<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:47.400> was<00:05:47.580> just<00:05:47.850> kind<00:05:48.060> of<00:05:48.150> sitting

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
bait and I was just kind of sitting

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.570 
bait and I was just kind of sitting
still<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:48.990> trying<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.770> think<00:05:50.010> my<00:05:50.160> way<00:05:50.340> through

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580

what I was gonna do next changing my
cadence<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.470> he<00:05:52.590> grabbed<00:05:52.889> it<00:05:53.039> so<00:05:53.520> one<00:05:53.669> of<00:05:53.699> the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
cadence and he grabbed it so one of the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.250 
cadence and he grabbed it so one of the
things<00:05:54.090> it<00:05:54.240> told<00:05:54.479> me<00:05:54.600> is<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.720> had<00:05:54.990> to<00:05:55.110> move

things it told me is I had to move

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.689 
things it told me is I had to move
slower<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:55.889> here's<00:05:56.130> what<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.280> did

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
I actually have gone to a thirty second

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.710 
I actually have gone to a thirty second
sounds<00:05:58.979> jig<00:05:59.280> one<00:05:59.850> of<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.060> things<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.450> want<00:06:00.660> to

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
look at doing throughout the day if you

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.830 
look at doing throughout the day if you
get<00:06:02.610> out<00:06:02.789> here<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.240> get<00:06:03.389> the<00:06:03.510> chance<00:06:03.750> to

you're<00:06:06.240> switching<00:06:06.600> different<00:06:07.200> size<00:06:07.380> jigs

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
you're switching different size jigs

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.950 
you're switching different size jigs
because<00:06:08.070> here's<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.400> thing<00:06:08.430> as<00:06:08.910> light<00:06:09.660> as<00:06:09.810> you

because here's the thing as light as you
can<00:06:09.990> go<00:06:10.380> means<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.340> slower<00:06:11.669> you're<00:06:11.940> gonna<00:06:12.030> be

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
can go means the slower you're gonna be

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.760 
can go means the slower you're gonna be
able<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.450> move<00:06:12.599> and<00:06:12.780> still<00:06:13.020> swim<00:06:13.289> it<00:06:13.440> up<00:06:13.530> above

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
able to move and still swim it up above

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.830 
able to move and still swim it up above
those<00:06:13.979> rocks<00:06:14.280> if<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:14.880> go<00:06:15.030> heavier<00:06:15.389> it's<00:06:15.660> gonna

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
those rocks if you go heavier it's gonna

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.570 
those rocks if you go heavier it's gonna
bounce<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.440> drop<00:06:16.620> down<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:17.010> those<00:06:17.099> rocks<00:06:17.340> and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
bounce and drop down in those rocks and

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.250 
bounce and drop down in those rocks and
for<00:06:18.030> some<00:06:18.210> reason<00:06:18.510> these<00:06:18.630> walleyes<00:06:18.840> today

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
for some reason these walleyes today

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.290 
for some reason these walleyes today
want<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.710> a<00:06:19.770> little<00:06:19.979> bit<00:06:20.130> slower<00:06:20.520> now<00:06:20.789> maybe

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
want it a little bit slower now maybe

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.730 
want it a little bit slower now maybe
they're<00:06:21.479> gonna<00:06:21.630> crank<00:06:21.900> up<00:06:22.080> as<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.410> day<00:06:22.560> goes

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
they're gonna crank up as the day goes

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.170 
they're gonna crank up as the day goes
on<00:06:22.950> and<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.490> can<00:06:23.639> get<00:06:23.760> away<00:06:23.849> with<00:06:24.060> that

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
on and you can get away with that

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.600 
on and you can get away with that
heavier<00:06:24.510> jig<00:06:24.810> but<00:06:24.960> try<00:06:25.289> different<00:06:26.130> sizes<00:06:26.460> of

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
heavier jig but try different sizes of

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.490 
heavier jig but try different sizes of
jigs<00:06:26.820> because<00:06:27.180> it's<00:06:27.389> gonna<00:06:27.479> vary<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.139> rate<00:06:28.289> to

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
jigs because it's gonna vary the rate to

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.110 
jigs because it's gonna vary the rate to
speed<00:06:28.800> with<00:06:28.979> which<00:06:29.220> you're<00:06:29.460> moving<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.910> bait

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
speed with which you're moving that bait

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.700 
speed with which you're moving that bait
and<00:06:30.570> that<00:06:30.660> can<00:06:30.810> make<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:30.930> huge<00:06:31.169> difference

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
and that can make a huge difference

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.320 
and that can make a huge difference
