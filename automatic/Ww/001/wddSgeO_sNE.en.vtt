prowess<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.849> right<00:02:31.810> now<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.049> would<00:02:32.530> say<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.799> this

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
prowess is right now I would say in this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.220 
prowess is right now I would say in this
format<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.370> second<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:33.909> none<00:02:34.030> I'm<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
format it's second to none I'm going to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
format it's second to none I'm going to
have<00:02:35.440> an<00:02:35.560> annotation<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.849> team<00:02:37.150> minorities

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
have an annotation to team minorities

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.569 
have an annotation to team minorities
video<00:02:38.500> we're<00:02:38.739> basically<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.250> show<00:02:39.549> off

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
video we're basically they show off

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.050 
video we're basically they show off
these<00:02:39.970> wind<00:02:40.239> up<00:02:40.390> combos<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:42.489> major<00:02:42.760> issue

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
these wind up combos but the major issue

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.690 
these wind up combos but the major issue
that<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.470> lineups<00:02:45.040> addressed<00:02:45.489> is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
that I think that lineups addressed is

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.369 
that I think that lineups addressed is
the<00:02:45.940> mid<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.510> late<00:02:46.690> game<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.079> this<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
the mid to late game and this is the

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.449 
the mid to late game and this is the
reason<00:02:47.500> why<00:02:47.680> i<00:02:47.799> think<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.280> deck<00:02:48.430> is

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
reason why i think that the deck is

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.039 
reason why i think that the deck is
going<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:48.970> good<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.690> because<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
going to be so good just because the

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.289 
going to be so good just because the
deck<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.440> offensively<00:02:51.190> explosive<00:02:52.120> doesn't

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
deck is offensively explosive doesn't

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.970 
deck is offensively explosive doesn't
make<00:02:52.599> it<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.750> best<00:02:52.959> deck<00:02:53.230> otherwise<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.859> know

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
make it the best deck otherwise you know

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.039 
make it the best deck otherwise you know
i<00:02:54.190> look<00:02:54.639> at<00:02:54.760> chaos<00:02:55.000> dragons<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.629> i<00:02:55.690> would<00:02:55.810> mean

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
i look at chaos dragons and i would mean

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.240 
i look at chaos dragons and i would mean
i<00:02:56.109> didn't<00:02:56.319> think<00:02:56.349> too<00:02:56.709> high<00:02:56.889> they<00:02:57.069> have<00:02:57.159> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
i didn't think too high they have the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.199 
i didn't think too high they have the
deck<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.489> thought<00:02:57.639> it<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.849> one<00:02:58.000> trick<00:02:58.150> pony

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
deck I thought it was a one trick pony

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.360 
deck I thought it was a one trick pony
for<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.690> most<00:02:58.840> part<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.620> would<00:02:59.889> not<00:03:00.069> give

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
for the most part but I would not give

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.099 
for the most part but I would not give
the<00:03:00.519> deck<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.879> crown<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.510> off<00:03:01.780> offensive

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
the deck the crown just off offensive

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.210 
the deck the crown just off offensive
explosiveness<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.280> look<00:03:03.849> at<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> fact<00:03:04.389> that<00:03:04.540> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
explosiveness I look at the fact that a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.860 
explosiveness I look at the fact that a
lot<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.250> people<00:03:06.430> i<00:03:06.730> mean<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.909> ton<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.389> people<00:03:07.780> are

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
lot of people i mean a ton of people are

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.080 
lot of people i mean a ton of people are
now<00:03:08.049> main<00:03:08.379> decking<00:03:08.829> you<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.430> they're<00:03:09.579> maxing

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
now main decking you know they're maxing

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
now main decking you know they're maxing
out<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.329> deep<00:03:10.540> prisons<00:03:10.959> they're<00:03:11.170> running<00:03:11.409> two

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
out on deep prisons they're running two

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.069 
out on deep prisons they're running two
to<00:03:11.650> three<00:03:11.980> copies<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.430> snow<00:03:12.879> man<00:03:13.090> eater<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.540> i

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
to three copies of snow man eater and i

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.170 
to three copies of snow man eater and i
think<00:03:14.379> this<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.859> going<00:03:15.159> to<00:03:15.340> solve<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.910> biggest

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
think this is going to solve the biggest

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.089 
think this is going to solve the biggest
problem<00:03:16.780> for<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> deck<00:03:17.290> which<00:03:17.500> obviously<00:03:17.859> is

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
problem for the deck which obviously is

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.500 
problem for the deck which obviously is

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
these cards and I think you basically

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.289 
these cards and I think you basically
answered<00:03:35.919> the<00:03:36.129> biggest<00:03:36.459> problem<00:03:36.819> you<00:03:36.910> had<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
answered the biggest problem you had the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.300 
answered the biggest problem you had the
biggest<00:03:37.480> problem<00:03:37.660> before<00:03:38.139> lineups<00:03:38.650> were<00:03:38.799> they

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
biggest problem before lineups were they

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.740 
biggest problem before lineups were they
could<00:03:39.489> loop<00:03:39.639> your<00:03:39.790> hand<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.180> honestly<00:03:40.569> you

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
could loop your hand but honestly you

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
could loop your hand but honestly you
can<00:03:40.900> actually<00:03:41.079> come<00:03:41.440> back<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.549> deck

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
can actually come back and the deck

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.610 
can actually come back and the deck
really<00:03:43.090> didn't<00:03:43.359> have<00:03:43.449> anything<00:03:43.780> outside<00:03:44.560> of

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
really didn't have anything outside of
