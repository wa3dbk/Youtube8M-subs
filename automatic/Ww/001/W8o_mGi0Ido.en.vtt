00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 more than a year ago the first ones arrived 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.720
 photos by of a camouflaged 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 volvo v40 10 piece higher than normal 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.320
 our mind was when look that's doe 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.050
 i the new xe 40 is not going to come one 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 nice suv in the c-segment 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 not so it was this car that follow 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 v40 cross country not real si4 but 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 just exactly the same body as the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 forty he is no longer for example 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.519
 but he is above 4 centimeters 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.080
 do the chassis completely 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.180
 I have more ground clearance , a higher seat 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 well we put some plastic on mirror covers 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 roof rails side skirts and suddenly you have 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.830
 a yes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 tougher car that what if the idea or 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.700
 to develop these as himself can eat 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.050
 that actually what well like here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 has the four-wheel drive but 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.990
 then only on the version with t5 so if 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 we often see that in the Netherlands 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710
 relative 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 of course it should start with it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.490
 practical use of the car 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.690
 right to exist 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.850
 what should he actually do with this he adds 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.260
 what may actually have to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.580
 not too difficult about it 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.410
 and you must look like an ar design 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 version of the v40 it's just one 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.580
 different appearance and pour some cooler 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.050
 out in some people and then it is 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.280
 personal taste i say yes i want that 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.990
 version because I just nicer 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.700
 think that is perhaps step 1 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 like an hour away he has it works 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.640
 added value but with those t5 and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.620
 with four-wheel drive 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.350
 yes that really really extra in 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.100
 every sweden snow ice then adds such 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.990
 of course for wheel drive too 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.150
 actually do something but the extra cost 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.500
 is again considerably dear t5 livable 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.660
 for all over asia and america 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.119
 then that will also be the only version and 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.070
 go see the netherlands define d2 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 maybe all for la floats g 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.760
 bacon trading 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.230
 technically v40 is cross country and also 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.090
 do not look for otherwise dashboard 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
 also completely right yes we are 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 your example and beat yourself whole 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 wisent control which you find the normal 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.950
 not 40 but that's why you have it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.210
 driving fast than he was a little more 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.010
 then have the regular 540 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.050
 slightly more embroidery wool that you want over 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.480
 is not so severe she still does 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.920
 getting pretty tight now i have it more 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.330
 send can play or a little bit up 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.040
 one more requirement could be released 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.930
 and then you also notice that you are steering 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.520
 just a little communicative than I really am 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.050
 had in mind those 40 then some 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.160
 always better but continue understanding it 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.570
 really pretty good 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.340
 the chassis is also very beautiful in it 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.320
 balanced who thought could be nice to be with 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.880
 be sure to go free and on public roads 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.650
 not that I also understand but the food 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.150
 from that the overall balance of car whole 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.070
 nice that was in the living room or 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.070
 and 40 so they this gary too 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.350
 fine for the design have to 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.640
 female drive system that is a haldex 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.230
 solution ie basically go 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.610
 back to the front and with haldex coupling 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.900
 I preceded my back rows 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.670
 freezes 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.050
 generations have a lot of development 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.520
 gone through it goes super nowadays 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.810
 soon you noticed that the more you see the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.910
 first week by smart padded apples and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.740
 behind you get in and even go 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.030
 such as if you have shockproof at all 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.320
 surface at the back for the sake 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.690
 while the we up to five 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.670
 percent behind and according to graham 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.350
 yes play well with that don't think so 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.750
 the SUV board really goes so far 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.330
 it all not in front and behind okay 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.770
 but it goes sideways as I a 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
 little accident a bit in the apple 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.500
 suddenly promises a wrong track calling 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.850
 of the road 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.410
 she actually didn't want that much 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.930
 clearly so out again and take a while 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.930
 how often was there and I just want no 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 but 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.250
 no you have to make very colorful if you want 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.750
 actually ended up next to the road 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.350
 course, how often do you think that 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.350
 works 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.620
 the extra cost will be this version 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.060
 about 2000 euros dressed up with one 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.730
 ordinary spring again you are right 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.050
 equipped and we are going to see the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.710
 practice people who work hard or red 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.570
 want 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.100
 no people who like that 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.870
 plastic seat on the outside 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.100
 mirror covers ducktales in cetera 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.750
 and people that big high is comfortable 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.550
 find well there are one in the Netherlands 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.320
 very high that friend in molyvos overs 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.240
 also in the layers him eat salt so 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.590
 yes this will be a copy 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.810
 has a right to exist there will be people 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.760
 be your buttocks i would say whole 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.200
 ordinary v40 has extra stitch in 2000 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.200
