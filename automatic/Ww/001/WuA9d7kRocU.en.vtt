 [Music] 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 g 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.900
 hi everyone so I hope that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.099
 you're fine because it's not good 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.530
 very well today I'm commenting on a 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.920
 attempts that I had you 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.410
 spoken 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.420
 finally one of the attempts that is actually 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.480
 in reality this is the first one I do 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.470
 who is not live 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.530
 I tried to comment on one in 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.269
 live but my comment was not very 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.720
 good and in addition the net part was not 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.750
 very good 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.570
 so it was with axa saw what you 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 know that I commented on his 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.040
 gameplay 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.930
 So here it is not live that I 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.220
 will discuss after so I present the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.360
 part I'm so clicked ballistic 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.570
 of course by chance my friend 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.550
 pitbull 570 you just saw 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.640
 launch a plane restions joined the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.860
 part and I think he does not have too much 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.950
 appreciated what will happen and that of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.780
 my side it's going to be okay 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.780
 I play the cut so ballistic self 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:35.479
 j &amp; j the tomahawk as featherweight asset 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.140
 not specific to what was missing from 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.490
 points and for a code to pass it in 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.259
 pro solid aiming that helps to recover 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.479
 faster than a knife like here you 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.920
 just see it never chained 2 where 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.349
 I already have 6 kills in a row for gt 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.970
 I was excited that I said that the city have 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.410
 been already successful and in third touched 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.229
 marathon that I have not yet spent in 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.149
 own that capture flag 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.759
 it sucks me not too much and it takes 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.149
 so after 15.3 points for the past in 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.090
 pro so that's how I played there 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.360
 I did not cheat in fact why I 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.099
 makes a good score you will see it 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's thanks to my team that had 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.480
 very good killstreaks so often 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.370
 I got spy planes like 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 here you saw that there was a group 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.209
 of genre four enemies who approached 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.950
 from me I hid behind the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.250
 truck 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.800
 and to avoid meeting them and so 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.260
 I did not buy again 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.050
 once pitbull it's really a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.670
 carnage for me unfortunately for 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.989
 him so here I have to talk to you 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.370
 many things today 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.780
 first of all live I actually wanted 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.060
 know if you prefer the kind of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.130
 videos I comment live because 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.239
 for me it's more difficult obviously 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.680
 in the end in itself good game will be less good 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.690
 but good my comment may be 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.970
 less good but be a little bit more 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.090
 funny but I had tried it on 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.560
 two games on modern warfare 2 it's me 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.940
 really upset because I had fallen 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.340
 on full of party with moors 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.959
 that honorable campers and everything is 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.780
 so my comment was also 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.880
 completely missed here I'm enjoying 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.790
 makes him that pitbull is received his parcel 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.069
 strategic to kill both enemies 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.720
 who was actually waiting there I do not have 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.530
 taken strategically again as 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.340
 the up 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.750
 a kill again because I killed 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.299
 include the recover his package 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.290
 so here you see it I'm already 10-0 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.850
 to 1 of my dogs so it was 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.280
 really amazing the first part 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.889
 I was super happy 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.569
 So I keep it soon 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.220
 should have a trial how tahri in 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.109
 anyway I think we will predict that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.470
 you are subscribed because in this 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:54.370
 moment we are exactly 93 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.700
 I would like to thank you very much 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.049
 glad that already arrived there in addition there 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.109
 may have a video that's going to be 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.870
 selected to be published on god qg 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.889
 which is a big chain of a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.720
 luckily the grenade did not kill me 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.830
 a big chain like in tariff 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.060
 French 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:17.440
 and here are the dogs to the effect of 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.269
 first shot penly 11.0 and luckily 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.700
 that jesus because look what's going 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.380
 happen to me right now I 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.430
 I'm going out because I'm comfortable 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.440
 no more risk 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.210
 finally I take risks and I 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.250
 have you kazakh 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.550
 so then for those who know 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.580
 sir v12 this video is a 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.790
 attempt at dogs that actually he has 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.650
 also made a video of the same kind where he 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.480
 succeeded, of course, because 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.360
 sir the v12 is someone pretty 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.070
 gifted gentleman video on youtube hours 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.530
 who makes impossible missions 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.050
 a concept that created it so its 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.450
 show that his subscribers suggest to him 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.820
 then no I will not copy even if 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.160
 I do the same thing you can 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.370
 even trusting since I posted 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.570
 my video announced our empathy scott 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.550
 before his mission video impossible at 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.290
 knife so as it is a very good 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.050
 youtuber that I recommend you I you 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.600
 would put finally I put you badly the year 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.910
 link to his bitch then about 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.800
 what will follow 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.530
 leopoldo so hayrane new should 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.919
 orders commented forgiveness one or two 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.390
 videos a search and destruction on 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.060
 black ops with a weapon that I do not you 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.660
 do not say to keep a little surprise 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.919
 as well as possibly if it works and 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.870
 that we learn that nature of 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.280
 problems with his makeup of the greens 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.889
 if it works 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.020
 a video on call of duty 4 then me 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.870
 I will try to make a gameplay to 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.469
 snipers good it's not obvious so I 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.319
 you promise nothing but I like to play 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:04.259
 It will be alright 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:06.360
 a little question for you is what 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.830
 so here is a project to 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.909
 montano who's legs 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.449
 it is a project to make a video of tutorials 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.120
 actually who would show or launch his 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.069
 grenades and where to stand with his sniper 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.849
 at the beginning of the game on all maps 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.400
 of call of duty 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:27.090
 it would be a kind of spot tutos 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.099
 as we call it for you to take 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.250
 end for beginners to know where 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.979
 to place a couple of frags in 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.539
 beginning of the game 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.279
 so if you want to play with me for 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.949
 my future attempts on modern 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.349
 warfare 2 and on black ops 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.750
 feel free to add me ycaa zz wild 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:50.300
 eyes case yes 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:52.130
 here I am so big on the video 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.590
 the next 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.930
 the next video so there by a 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.330
 possible sniper wound it will be 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:07.350
 surely a news lens on modern 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:11.370
 warfare 2 is also my project 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.990
 to go on krisis and that's it 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.510
 final range for me so ski france 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.640
 for a total of 22 12 so I quickly 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.380
 speed up as the video has finished i've 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.650
 not want to hold you back with a screen 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.650
 black 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.510
 so my project is to make a video 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.980
 possibly on krisis by the demo 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:31.230
 who came out yesterday and number the day before yesterday 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.880
 and the second map today so I 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.250
 wanted to know what are you interested in say 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.600
 me that their life comments and finally 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.140
 a life is a life you do a little 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.050
 ad 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.700
 we are looking for a publisher for our videos 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.130
 nofrag movie and mistakes because we have 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.960
 a few frags in reserve and we 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.470
 would like someone to have them 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.390
 said to make a little fragmovie of 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.950
 two chains here thank you all for your 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:57.919
 attention I hope this gameplay you 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.919
