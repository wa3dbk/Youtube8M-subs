00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.010
 Musicstar TV's handy controller 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.900
 The company icon are really absolute 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 topseller in our music store 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.280
 because there really is for each 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 field of application the right device 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 Reason enough these controllers once 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.090
 to look very closely 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.830
 In this episode we throw one 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.140
 look at the ipad controller properly 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.810
 heard the thing really means ipad has 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 but nothing with the eponymous tablet 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.930
 logically 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.460
 it is one I would like 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.130
 say mainly for drummer 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.770
 Connections suitable controller because 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.690
 He delivers twelve big stops 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.320
 dynamic pads feel comfortable 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.340
 actually play around drum ideal 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 play sounds and these tricks 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.379
 Of course you can send MIDI notes or 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.440
 controller data so you can in 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.990
 adjust the software what you want 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.780
 additionally there is this xy touchpad 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.360
 because that means you can also get one here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.150
 controller drauflegen or more exactly 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.520
 taken and then wipe with the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.520
 fingers that interfere with that too can 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 just for modulations so much 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 be very practical 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 and then there is another mistake 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.780
 Of course, too free here was the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.540
 controller that you want to control with it 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.910
 besides, the ipad controller still has 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.100
 ten buttons that means you can 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.960
 pre-program up to 14 presets and 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.300
 on the side you will find only 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.770
 the connections that is very 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.990
 clear as with all corners 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.940

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.000

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.600
 also supplied white by the way 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.400
 usb cable plugged in so he is with 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.620
 connected to the computer and the other 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.620
 is the so-called econet connection 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.840

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.379
