00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149
 ah 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.210
 ah 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.360
 it's a culture 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 and as such who has his norm and 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.110
 I also believe that as any culture 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.110
 it has to have its rules 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750
 and being autonomous 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.150
 he is not able to live by himself alone 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.150
 here 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.960
 I believe that the essence will always be 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.860
 in focused to be self-taught the one 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.330
 has clear essences 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.330
 the one that goes far 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.120
 I think it's always going to be this way to be 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.100
 autodidact 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.850
 in life you have to do it and I live 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.369
 alive 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.020
 I dedicate myself to this in my way of living it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.659
 already the chosen one not fitting I'm going to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.950
 accept brother I think 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.950
 and I will do self-taught 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.930
 two 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.479
 I think it's the raja that this rapper 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.479
 let's do 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.630
 the business us 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.630
 love 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.880
 ah 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.820
 ah 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.820
 ah 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.180
 and I think in that aspect 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 reinvent means to go towards something like that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.240
 that better goes away I think it's what you take and 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.900
 you make them to your form and I think that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 young graffiti 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.910
 in the beatbox all the branches that can 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.590
 have they are even in ventures 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 economic when reaching a brand of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.260
 clothes is a reinvention of something and I think 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.970
 that in that aspect it is not necessary that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.239
 you have to be a graphic design for 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.239
 do 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.150
 12 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.220
 I believe that if there is a young person in general 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.570
 his philosophy comes from the authority 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.800
 that's why I think it's also so 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.940
 accessible 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.200
 Y 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.989
 urban culture 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.989
 more powerful than there are apart
