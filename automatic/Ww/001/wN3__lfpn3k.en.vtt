00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello youtube friends talk to them their 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.919
 friend place and 135 and this is my first 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 xd video so I'll start talking to you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.300
 about some mysteries of the game the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.730
 legend of zelda majora's mask good 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.680
 let's start 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 one of the things that seem to me most 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.789
 strange is that at the beginning of the game 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
 after school kit will steal the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.779
 horse and the ocarina someone who 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
 will send to fly xd we see half of a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.800
 tree where school kit draws bin 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 next to him and the two fairies at the end of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 game but the strange thing is that if at 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.250
 start of the game we are next to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 that trunk and at the end we pass again 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.089
 by that trunk means that the link 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 is lost in the forest and that's why 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.620
 ride bona with his head down like 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 showing tiredness or worry not 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.940
 I know if it's a game error xd but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.940
 for me it is something very strange and sad 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.699
 another strange thing that I still do not fit in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.890
 the head is that when falling through the hole 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.960
 that brings us to the end we see that they come out 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.210
 a series of drawings as masks 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 Ocarinas and watches as trying to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.650
 to say that it ends is a magical place 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.750
 where the masks are weapons the time 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.490
 is important and the ocarina is the key 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.620
 of salvation in case any 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.160
 anomaly to himself as happened with 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160
 school key 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.450
 the third mystery is that after that 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.249
 school turns us into the cube we have 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.020
 some lights that come out of the part 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.850
 top and the floor look three 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 triangles that I believe are the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.109
 triangle triangles but these 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.450
 they are unarmed indicating to the 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.369
 door where we should go many say that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 in terms they hate the goddesses 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 they created the trifuerza and they also say that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.060
 they decided to leave the trifuerza in 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.860
 go along with the wise but with this 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 that I see, I infer that the triforza in 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
 reality is in finished is in some 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.670
 place after walking actually not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.260
 I know very well but it's something that happens to me 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.500
 the mind from the first time that what 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.500
 I played 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.819
 this may not be a mystery but 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.440
 idea to give chills xd when 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.599
 we come to the little part where 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.489
 we found the butler's son we see 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.920
 that the door closes with bars and 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 after passing those little flowers and we passed 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.909
 the door also closes and does not 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.010
 open more this means that enter 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.870
 you can not return to go as 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.709
 dizzy will be destined to die with the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.709
 fall of the moon 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.159
 ah 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.960
 the fifth mystery is that when talking to 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.850
 the seller of happy masks if we 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.250
 we fix we see that he has the mask 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.840
 that we get as the mirror shield that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.700
 means that the how the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.620
 world looking for masks maybe I can 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.050
 know the story of him because the gesture 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.750
 of his face or because they made a shield 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.330
 with his face is something very strange 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.740
 that this game gives me so much fear xd xd 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.740
 do not go flying 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.850
 good friends that was all for today because 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.100
 I was too lazy to keep looking for things 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.560
 strange in this game then I will continue 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.240
 showing other mysteries I have tasks 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.700
 what to do and later I'll go with my 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.050
 brother to buy a couple of things I hope 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.480

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.820

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.980

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.220
