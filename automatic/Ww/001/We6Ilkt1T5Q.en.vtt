00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.220 
believe he also has four star skills
also<00:02:48.880> in<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.300> strike<00:02:49.510> composition<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.080> guys

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
also in the strike composition you guys

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.630 
also in the strike composition you guys
might<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.530> wondering<00:02:50.709> how<00:02:51.010> does<00:02:51.190> Wellington

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
might be wondering how does Wellington

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.039 
might be wondering how does Wellington
fit<00:02:51.819> into<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.060> but<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.720> take<00:02:52.870> out

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
fit into it but if you take out

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.660 
fit into it but if you take out
Hernandez<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> guys<00:02:54.130> are<00:02:54.280> about<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.549> see

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
Hernandez as you guys are about to see

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.820 
Hernandez as you guys are about to see
here<00:02:54.970> he<00:02:55.330> will<00:02:55.450> still<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.019> nine<00:02:56.260> chemistry

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
here he will still get nine chemistry

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.530 
here he will still get nine chemistry
because<00:02:56.980> everyone<00:02:57.489> around<00:02:57.519> him<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.030> Brazilian

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
because everyone around him is Brazilian

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.420 
because everyone around him is Brazilian
but<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.319> only<00:02:59.410> circumstances<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.340> had

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
but that's the only circumstances he had

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.650 
with the surfboard celebration which I
believe<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.430> hold<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.940> left<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
believe you just hold to the left of a

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.660 
believe you just hold to the left of a
whole<00:03:37.900> Darby<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.380> just<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.769> hold<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
whole Darby and just to hold it to the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.940 
whole Darby and just to hold it to the
left<00:03:39.940> but<00:03:40.120> Wellington's<00:03:40.660> pace<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.230> blistering

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
left but Wellington's pace is blistering

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.009 
left but Wellington's pace is blistering
and<00:03:42.040> that's<00:03:42.220> what<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.640> gets<00:03:43.510> passed<00:03:43.840> in

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
and that's what really gets passed in

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.270 
and that's what really gets passed in
defenders<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.470> can<00:03:44.590> play<00:03:44.709> over<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.100> top

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
defenders you can play over the top

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280 
defenders you can play over the top
three<00:03:45.459> balls<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.150> ground<00:03:46.239> he<00:03:46.840> will<00:03:47.019> most

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
three balls on the ground he will most

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.110 
three balls on the ground he will most
likely<00:03:47.530> get<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.010> him<00:03:48.130> although<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.519> have<00:03:48.820> really

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120

then he got an upgrade but again they're

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.970 
then he got an upgrade but again they're
coutinho<00:04:04.269> showing<00:04:04.810> his<00:04:05.019> skills<00:04:05.560> with<00:04:05.680> those

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
coutinho showing his skills with those

coutinho showing his skills with those
with<00:04:06.850> those<00:04:06.880> shots<00:04:07.209> from<00:04:07.329> outside<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> box

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
with those shots from outside the box

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.930 
with those shots from outside the box
because<00:04:08.260> he<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.530> honestly<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> very<00:04:09.519> impressive

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
because he is honestly a very impressive

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.430 
because he is honestly a very impressive
player<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.389> that's<00:04:10.540> mainly<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.049> reason<00:04:11.170> why

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
player and that's mainly the reason why

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.470 
player and that's mainly the reason why
I<00:04:11.470> decided<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.889> pick<00:04:12.069> him<00:04:12.250> over<00:04:12.280> Morales<00:04:12.940> was

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
I decided to pick him over Morales was

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.690 
I decided to pick him over Morales was
for<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.840> fact<00:04:14.049> that<00:04:14.170> his<00:04:14.590> shot<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.160> so<00:04:15.489> good

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
for the fact that his shot was so good

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.490 
for the fact that his shot was so good
from<00:04:15.850> just<00:04:16.090> outside<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.479> box<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.900> as<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.350> can

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
from just outside the box and as you can

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.569 
from just outside the box and as you can
see<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:17.859> what<00:04:17.979> I'm<00:04:18.070> talking<00:04:18.310> about<00:04:18.370> the

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
see this is what I'm talking about the

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.699 
see this is what I'm talking about the
blistering<00:04:19.000> pace<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.560> Wellington<00:04:20.560> does

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
blistering pace and Wellington does

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.110 
blistering pace and Wellington does
sometimes<00:04:21.130> have<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> few<00:04:21.669> issues<00:04:21.700> when<00:04:22.090> it

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
sometimes have a few issues when it

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.310 
sometimes have a few issues when it
comes<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.479> finishing<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.930> really<00:04:23.169> easy

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
comes to finishing the really easy

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.230 
comes to finishing the really easy
chances<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:24.159> for<00:04:24.340> some<00:04:24.460> reason<00:04:24.760> he<00:04:24.880> manages

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
chances but for some reason he manages

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.540 
chances but for some reason he manages
to<00:04:25.390> put<00:04:25.570> away<00:04:25.659> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
to put away the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.540 
to put away the
in<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:27.030> difficult<00:04:27.479> chances<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.220> he's<00:04:29.220> just

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
in more difficult chances and he's just

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.460 
in more difficult chances and he's just
a<00:04:29.669> very<00:04:29.699> solid<00:04:30.360> player<00:04:30.569> but<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.810> am<00:04:30.960> enjoying

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
a very solid player but I am enjoying

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.089 
a very solid player but I am enjoying
the<00:04:31.680> combination<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.370> Hernandez<00:04:33.360> and

three star skills I think which is a bit
of<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.080> letdown<00:04:52.289> really<00:04:52.740> he<00:04:52.860> would<00:04:53.069> be<00:04:53.190> an

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
of a letdown really he would be an

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.270 
of a letdown really he would be an
immense<00:04:53.879> player<00:04:54.240> if<00:04:54.449> he<00:04:54.479> was<00:04:55.159> forced<00:04:56.159> our

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
immense player if he was forced our

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.550 
immense player if he was forced our
skills<00:04:56.580> but<00:04:56.849> I<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.599> had<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.780> settle<00:04:58.080> for<00:04:58.199> I'm
