00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.389
 because he questions how they are if even 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.700
 I bring you a new video here 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.299
 teaching them what is a new gray that 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.039
 it came out recently at 1.7 point 2 this one 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.720
 has come a new way to break what 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.699
 what is the life of rock in the way 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.160
 survival not obviously without doing any 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.550
 use in any way and without doing our 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.720
 neither in the creative way this is something 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.130
 that I found interesting because 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.360
 also many times he does not have a world 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.930
 of football and want to continue 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.190
 building one already has as its their 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.140
 constructions in the normal world has 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.570
 his constructions in the leader has his 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.450
 buildings in Vienna is set in 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.700
 teeth for now because not in the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.470
 empty not just one can make use 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.750
 of whatever it is not to throw things like 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.460
 trashcan as you want is here as 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.290
 can you see this let's make use of what 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.050
 what are these new trees that have 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 come out these big guys this four of 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.579
 the root I do not know how to say that they have 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.950
 four but good here we are like 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.420
 you can see here is the emptiness here 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.390
 down we will go down as you can see 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.100
 put all black this and well was not 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 very beautiful in sight see how beautiful 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.550
 landscape and good I'm going to show you how 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.290
 it is done is quite 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.570
 simple there's not much problem in 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.730
 do it and obviously this is the dog that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.990
 it's very very fast in the ocean you have 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.820
 to finish a lot because this world what 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.820
 says especially for that obviously 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.950
 in a normal world this is going to be a lot 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.510
 deeper sometimes not but the same works 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.040
 perfectly fine today I'm going to 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
 show let's go a little bit here I 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.300
 I think where we can do the quiete 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.680
 let's do it here makes me pass by here 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.410
 we have the things that we are going to need 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.940
 I'm going to do everything in survival so that 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.770
 can see what then everything can be in 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.390
 survival and let's pick up a few 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.360
 tools that we will need to 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 do this 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 Some are optional, such as 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.650
 shovel is optional or the h is optional or the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.930
 Light also torches is optional 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.250
 but to do it faster is not 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.310
 what you have to do at the beginning is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 just make a 4x4 hole up 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.160
 where is the see it obviously this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.600
 I will show the and 4x4 obviously 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.610
 I say when you arrive when you see what 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.380
 in a survival world this is going to be a lot 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.840
 more adding up enough in an adult then 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.790
 they're going to have to break a little more than 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.990
 normal of what I'm going to do here but 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.910
 I also tell them they have to do 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.820
 space for the tree to grow 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.950
 with this enough this we have to 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.959
 leave four here for really to 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.650
 let grow the tree this let put 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.600
 times &amp; day we are this let's do 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 a ladder no more for right now 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.770
 go out with the shovel obviously what 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.380
 stupid we are going to put this here 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.760
 and with this one what are the obvious ones 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.620
 they have to check that these are not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600
 obviously they have to do this dark or 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.930
 chaplin has to make these new 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.070
 new little trees this milk combo now 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.230
 we make it grow what we have left 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.610
 couple of times there we are and how can 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.540
 see the first tree grows not here 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 we have the first 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.469
 the first one comes out others I'm going to show 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.629
 because now what we have to do is 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.829
 break a row here below as 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.260
 you can see how I'm doing they have 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.290
 that break a row and go back to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.239
 put links we are this we go back to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.879
 make the tree grow a few times 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.030
 and there we are already made the book said the 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.319
 gray or whatever you want to tell him this step 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.849
 how can you see a manzanita letter 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.959
 in which pretty will be a manzanita 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.730
 of good pilon let's see and how can 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.900
 see I'm going to show you what is going on 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.510
 well here as you can see there are some 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.790
 blocks that start to get back on 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 but with the replace but with these 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.450
 these blocks not then when 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.669
 they obviously replace one and the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.069
 can break and here we have directly 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.079
 the vacuum we're going to put this here for 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.000
 drop the account that I am in creative 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.560
 I say that I am in survivor as they can 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.750
 see here was also replaced then 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.250
 we can also break it then this 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.650
 process that I just showed you of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.299
 break this and get aplix and do it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.489
 grow and you have to do a couple of 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.360
 times or depends on how much you want it 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.430
 be the hole at 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.230
 to the void as you can see he had 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.420
 how many here we have one here we have 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.920
 another and if we want more emptiness 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.390
 later those who come back to repeat 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.140
 the process does not do the same thing again 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.140
 I will pass exactly the same 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.520
 this and as you can see they are going to see others 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.940
 places where they will be replaced by 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.290
 wood this I think this was already that 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.440
 it was not clear that this one was not 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.450
 just appeared and so on 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.519
 again and again until put one that 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.260
 is satisfied this let's go back to 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.870
 do one more time so they can see 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.190
 Finally, obviously, the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.110
 Sometimes they want to do everything 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.700
 the full circle or the square best 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.730
 said because it 's a circle in microns very 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.590
 circles and do that let's see how many 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.840
 times it was 15 this was not it will be the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.400
 term now this one was already I think 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.660
 I think it was already this this was not 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.820
 as this row is already here 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.770
 all complete of wood then they 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.210
 I say little by little one can go doing 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
 all this leads as you can see it is already 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.270
 full of way to do emplazó 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.520
 these two are missing and here below also 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.169
 it's almost everything I go with a 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.060
 more would already be ready can not miss 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.180
 these two already all this can already be 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.980
 break this and then we have the emptiness 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.720
 directly obviously have a lot 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.050
 be careful not to leave because if they fall 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.340
 this I am not responsible 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.830
 I do not take responsibility directly 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.910
 and well this is basically everything for the 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.639
 people who would like 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.360
 and it did something interesting to me because I never 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.710
 had been able to break what is the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.260
 metro and now we have the option 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.570
 we can obviously break the war 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.550
 it's not 100% legal legal so to speak 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.650
 since it is a cliché but here is the 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.300
 opportunity to do so as well 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.430
 I think this is going to be everything is a video 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.260
 quite short progressed it made me very 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.360
 interesting and well I had this 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.590
 here so I hope you liked it and 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.590
 see you until next time
