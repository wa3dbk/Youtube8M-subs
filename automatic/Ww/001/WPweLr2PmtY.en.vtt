00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.609
 at 12 today 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:09.879
 josé joly 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.879
 to show how to transplant 1 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.399
 cy youngs care 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.960
 everything we need to 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.259
 a plant 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.259
 For example, we have chosen an art 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.289
 holt and this 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.050
 big enough for him to live for a few years 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 volcanic ibra 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.430
 potting soil 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.970
 fertilizer wand 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.780
 some garden gloves 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.270
 we started 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.069
 it was a little 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.069
 The botanic 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.090
 which will make it easier for the plant to have good drainage 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 I want 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.210
 and then 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.800
 we take out the sole of the foot 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.230
 the dépor 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.060
 until completing it 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.950
 in this way 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.090
 delivered the plant 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.260
 prepared 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 for what 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.820
 grow well sardá 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.570
 healthy 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260
 we can put it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.190
 Fertilizer bars 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.060
 so that alone 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.230
 go grabbing everything that will need both 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.820
 it seems that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.120
 leafy 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.670
 and many 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.340
 to consider one thing 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.970
 the plant is very important but so important in the volcanic rock 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.180
 have 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.220
 good drainage 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.300
 and so the plant can live 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.040
 simple when it comes 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.630
 rot 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.540
 the plant is already finished we want to go and so everything 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.910
 transplanted 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.100
 Now you have to look for a boy 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.369
 where you can live well develop well 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.540
 he does not want the feeling 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 and obviously needs a site that has 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.589
 between his works 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.039
 little hours of sun 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.449
 a suitable site 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.449
 where the plant feels comfortable 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.810
 the next test he was shocked and teaches how he writes a ricky garden nothing 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.629
 duckling 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.789
 what you can have things 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.079
 little ruled well watching with bichillo as its quota
