definitely recommend this mod and it is
one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.040> popular<00:00:44.250> mods<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.239> there

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
one of the more popular mods out there

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
one of the more popular mods out there
at<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> moment<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
at the moment and that's because it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
at the moment and that's because it
really<00:00:47.820> does<00:00:47.910> make<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> game<00:00:48.539> look<00:00:48.570> prettier

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
really does make the game look prettier

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
really does make the game look prettier
and<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.620> look<00:00:49.980> even<00:00:50.250> better<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.059> used

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and it will look even better when used

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
and it will look even better when used
in<00:00:51.510> conjunction<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.410> next<00:00:52.649> mod<00:00:53.030> Skyrim

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in conjunction with the next mod Skyrim

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.959 
in conjunction with the next mod Skyrim
enhanced<00:00:54.510> shaders<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.920> decide<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
enhanced shaders which I decide to use a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.889 
enhanced shaders which I decide to use a
few<00:00:57.239> stills<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.829> show<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> off<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
few stills to show this off because it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
few stills to show this off because it
really<00:01:01.170> affects<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> lighting<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.489> be

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
really affects the lighting which can be

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.620 
really affects the lighting which can be
difficult<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.989> videos<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.630> here

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
difficult to see in some videos so here

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
difficult to see in some videos so here
it<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> before<00:01:08.010> still<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> then

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it is there's the before still and then

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
it is there's the before still and then
an<00:01:08.909> after<00:01:09.090> still<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
an after still and you can see the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
an after still and you can see the
difference<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.100> remarkable<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
difference is really remarkable and it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.499 
difference is really remarkable and it's
fully<00:01:13.170> compatible<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.890> fxaa<00:01:14.520> post-process

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
fully compatible with fxaa post-process

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
fully compatible with fxaa post-process
injector<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.770> i<00:01:16.799> would<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.490> recommend

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
injector so i would really recommend

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.860 
injector so i would really recommend
that<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.330> those<00:01:18.720> two<00:01:18.960> mods<00:01:19.200> together

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.810 

the<00:01:29.870> mod<00:01:30.050> also<00:01:30.440> includes<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.920> Sun<00:01:31.160> glare<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the mod also includes a Sun glare that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.520 
the mod also includes a Sun glare that
is<00:01:31.970> much<00:01:32.330> better<00:01:32.630> than<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.930> vanilla<00:01:33.230> Sun

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
is much better than the vanilla Sun

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.200 
is much better than the vanilla Sun
glare<00:01:33.860> as<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.250> can<00:01:34.400> see<00:01:34.550> it's<00:01:34.700> much<00:01:35.000> more

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
glare as you can see it's much more

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.140 
glare as you can see it's much more
realistic<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:36.140> even<00:01:37.100> though<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.370> don't<00:01:37.880> look

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
realistic and even though you don't look

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.090 
realistic and even though you don't look
at<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> Sun<00:01:38.600> very<00:01:38.870> much<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.410> really<00:01:39.590> does<00:01:39.890> help

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
at the Sun very much it really does help

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.469 
at the Sun very much it really does help
enhance<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.700> game
