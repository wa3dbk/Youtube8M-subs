00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.729
 hello people and welcome to a2 my 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.470
 reviews about around 290 first 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.070
 I thank you for the positive 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.660
 resonance of the first video and would like 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.490
 then submit a little info 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.620
 and I will only do two videos 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.170
 to make this graphics card because it 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.240
 already hundreds of thousands of websites are where 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.220
 he in combination with all 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.930
 processors benchmark 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.640
 and there it would send us now 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.750
 video of these summarized 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.910
 to make benchmarks 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 so if you want to see benchmark 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.260
 google it easy there are thousands 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.670
 Results We will be together today 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.239
 ever the wheels applications 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.489
 look at 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.469
 that is, we will become borders 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.839
 gambling and the results of it 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.800
 look at small information 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.710
 I have a fx 8350 on 4 as a processor 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.920
 4 ghz overclocked and of course the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.690
 raider 9 290 windforce looks three times 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.339
 First of all, maybe I should 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.920
 Let's say that I shooter at all 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.960
 not so do not be surprised 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 and yes we play along like battlefield 4 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 directx eleven so not yet with a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.200
 the coats because I only bought for apps 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.149
 have and freebsd can not mentally yet 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.729
 record because that's just another kind 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.170
 is how the game is changed 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.479
 and that's why we're playing now 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.950
 here with time attack series and 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.659
 do not have the full performance the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.399
 we can get as our card 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.000
 mental offers here for example now 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.859
 Up to 40% frame increases and the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.420
 is then again properly then 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.880
 You also have to say that to me 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.119
 here record and therefore the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.079
 Frames average 10 lower 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.250
 Here you can see what I am doing now 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.259
 have spoken the frames are 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.740
 clearly higher if I do not use rapeseed 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.740
 take up 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.380
 I one are glare now below 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.030
 estimated values ​​with merkel 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 So I have the frames for a while 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.979
 watched and about the frames should 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.679
 but of course I can not 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 say exactly like now rapeseed or something 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.009
 I still have to say 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.780
 the driver I use here he 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 is still in the beta phase and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.650
 andré said that the final driver 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.910
 much better results 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.069
 should deliver 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.709
 We will also have a look at a game now 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.110
 namely 3 3 offers its own 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.829
 benchmark and yes, let's take a look 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.829
 now just go 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.890
 like battlefield 4 you can find here 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.550
 about 10 frames for the record to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.530
 count 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 and also this game I play in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.250
 highest settings 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.360
 so now we have the test result 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.370
 I can certainly see 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.110
 and yes this frame test has the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.110
 graphics card clearly survived 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.950
 so now 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.739
 ring arrived and that I will with 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.269
 sony vegas this rendering test 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.250
 run there is such a special 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.140
 template you can download yourself 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.310
 The link to this I will again in 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.440
 write the description 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.180
 Unfortunately, I have no other idea 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.819
 come what I could change 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.440
 If you have ideas in the like 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.319
 I will definitely comment on it 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.660
 but I do not have that many 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.099
 programs where you can edit but me 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.470
 I will definitely enjoy these programs 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.330
 if you want to see anything 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 I will like the whole test for you 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.709
 make pull here in the background right now 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.750
 the relatively simple look of the video 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.269
 but what is changed in full-hd and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.849
 but relatively expensive for processor 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.430
 graphics card is and now we are already 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.739
 through and have the test in 37 seconds 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.500
 pass your likes to write 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.720
 test results in the comments 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.850
 the manual as their gut is found 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.250
 her on the website in my 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.810
 infobox is and yes it would be 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.270
 interesting to see what others are having 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.220
 other graphics cards and processors for 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.860
 Obtain a result of course 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.240
 still some full hd gm place follow where 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.180
 he can just see you like that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.770
 graphics card under full load but works 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.970
 the main reviews now with this video 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.500
 actually completed 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.330
 then I say thank you very much that you 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.080
 Also looked at this part of the review 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.710
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.139
 Suggestions for improvement as always per 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.430
