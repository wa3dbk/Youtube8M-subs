00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
stick and if I turn around which are

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.710 
stick and if I turn around which are
most<00:02:38.370> likely<00:02:38.549> not<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.510> just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
most likely not going to do I'm just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.940 
most likely not going to do I'm just
going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.900> keep<00:02:40.049> your<00:02:40.230> kind<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.680> face

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
going to keep your kind of like face

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.520 
going to keep your kind of like face
forward<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:42.150> face<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> side<00:02:42.780> we're<00:02:43.319> kind

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
forward for face to the side we're kind

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.059 
forward for face to the side we're kind
of<00:02:43.560> turning<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.989> since<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.440> trimmer<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.859> can

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
of turning but since it's trimmer I can

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.979 
of turning but since it's trimmer I can
practically<00:02:47.489> do<00:02:47.670> anything<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.120> her<00:02:48.239> so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that's the only disadvantage of the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.729 
that's the only disadvantage of the
