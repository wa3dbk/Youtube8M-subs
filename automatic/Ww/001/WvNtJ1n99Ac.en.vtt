00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
idea didn't want to go through with it

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.899 
idea didn't want to go through with it
when<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.620> happened<00:03:37.980> though<00:03:38.099> go<00:03:38.370> ahead<00:03:38.580> yeah

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
and their directives were basically make

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.130 
and their directives were basically make
it<00:03:41.010> as<00:03:41.159> painful<00:03:41.400> as<00:03:41.730> possible<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.049> I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
it as painful as possible and and I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.809 
it as painful as possible and and I
