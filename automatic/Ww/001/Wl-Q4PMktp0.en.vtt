00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
do was go over one of the things that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
do was go over one of the things that
that<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.750> been<00:00:30.929> asked<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> told<00:00:32.040> about

that I had been asked and told about

that I had been asked and told about
which<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:33.230> putting<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> char<00:00:34.890> cloth<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.309> top

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which was putting the char cloth on top

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
which was putting the char cloth on top
of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> piece<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.149> quartz<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:37.110> I've<00:00:37.200> been

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of the piece of quartz now I've been

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.350 
of the piece of quartz now I've been
working<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.820> video<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
working with this and that video was

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
working with this and that video was
actually<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:39.930> time<00:00:40.620> I'd<00:00:40.950> ever

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
actually the first time I'd ever

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.720 
actually the first time I'd ever
actually<00:00:41.579> gone<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> done<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.780> using

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
actually gone out and done that using

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.200 
actually gone out and done that using
the<00:00:44.730> courts<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> steel<00:00:46.789> now<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the courts and steel now from what I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
the courts and steel now from what I
understand<00:00:48.840> putting<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.469> top<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.100> more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
understand putting it on top is more

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
understand putting it on top is more
effective<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.860> what<00:00:52.860> I've<00:00:53.010> seen<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.340> far<00:00:54.500> it's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
effective and what I've seen so far it's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
effective and what I've seen so far it's
a<00:00:55.649> thousand<00:00:56.160> times<00:00:56.370> easier<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
a thousand times easier just like that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.340 
a thousand times easier just like that
just<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.649> couple<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> strikes<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.170> you've<00:01:04.170> got

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just a couple of strikes and you've got

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:18.220 
just a couple of strikes and you've got
an<00:01:04.470> ember<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.489> char<00:01:05.700> cloth<00:01:06.020> start<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> fire

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.120 

just<00:01:19.230> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.740> seriously

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just like that but that is seriously

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
just like that but that is seriously
what<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> consider<00:01:27.320> survival<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.650> having<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
