00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.260
 welcome because know before 8 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.599
 some of them want to know something 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.000
 happens when the lightning in the water 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.560
 strikes 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.430
 in the wild this is hard to do 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.520
 check 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 but my colleague and the team of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.680
 have the duisburg header 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.779
 hochspannungslabor visits the first time 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.710
 that made such an experiment 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.020
 The generator was created artificial 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.290
 lightning with a voltage of at least 2 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.940
 million volts in nature so the lightning 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.930
 tensions even five times higher 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.190
 the lightning strikes the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.410
 water surface 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.449
 because what he can conduct the current bad 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.510
 the energy is not completely at one 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.000
 point to drain down therefore spreads 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.500
 the view over the whole 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.409
 water surface in all directions 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.170
 the energy is so high that the water 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.930
 immediately evaporated it forms one 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 water wave the further you go from the impact 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.229
 point away is the weaker 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.409
 The current 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:21.789
 same try and this time seems 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:24.640
 my colleague in the basin again the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.720
 lightning this time he hits directly 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 in the doll 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.840
 the experiment is repeated several times 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.149
 and always the same result the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 doll or in the reality of the swimmer 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.420
 automatically turns into a lightning rod 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.090
 the reason of the joke prefers higher 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 there are objects and in the middle of a lake 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.849
 no trees or houses the the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 lightning could distract even if 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:54.130
 you are submerged you have no chance 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.170
 because even under water is still flowing 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.310
 Dangerously much current through the body 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.610
 of the diver after these pictures there are 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.709
 a clear message 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.709
 get out of the water when it's thunderstorm
