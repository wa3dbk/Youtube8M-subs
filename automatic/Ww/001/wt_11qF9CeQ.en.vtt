00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
that the right defensive end is out of

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the play he immediately goes to the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
the play he immediately goes to the
second<00:03:01.560> level<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:02.220> pick<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.579> linebacker

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
second level to pick up the linebacker

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.220 
second level to pick up the linebacker
if<00:03:03.239> he<00:03:03.299> doesn't<00:03:03.599> do<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.049> linebacker

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
if he doesn't do that that linebacker

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.229

has a clear shot on Jackson for maybe a
two-yard<00:03:06.660> gain<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:09.060> fix<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
two-yard gain so you can see fix up the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.449 
two-yard gain so you can see fix up the
linebacker<00:03:10.260> totally<00:03:10.829> gets<00:03:11.010> him<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
linebacker totally gets him out of the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.460
