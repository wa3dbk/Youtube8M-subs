00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello girls today I take pictures for you 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.940
 video I want to show how 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.210
 visually you can increase the size of the eye 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 but hereby we round it up a little 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 that is, we do not output any china until 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 this will not happen 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 and I do it all on the example of makeup 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:32.120
 nude style probably i will bring you closer 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:35.510
 in my person I take the base under makeup 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.370
 but it is not necessary to use the base 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.149
 can you take the concealer you can take 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.590
 concealer door take a white base and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 I will take a brush 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:55.530
 from Sigma under the number of 82 and apply this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.440
 white base on the inner corner of the eye and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 also on the area under the brow 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.829
 if you do not have a white base you can 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.829
 use white pencil 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:13.180
 I take a powdery palette 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 I will not call the number because it is like 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.650
 confiscated and in essence it is nameless 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.770
 a palette and I type here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.550
 I pick on a powdery shade on 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.940
 brush from the maestro at number 321 and 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:38.920
 caliber her 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:41.610
 12 and apply this powdery shade on all 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 movable eyelid 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.049
 crease 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.500
 pats this shade i 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.130
 I shade here something like tsunada down 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 not like to find do usually but this 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:18.070
 here are areas yes under the bone and from here and 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:25.090
 down now i will take some 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:28.870
 small brush take a brush from 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.150
 jeans numbered 25 take this one 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.630
 the last powdery shade which 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.710
 darker went to a piece quite a bit 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 little and put it on the bottom line of growth 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:47.020
 cilia he will go for shading I'll take 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.340
 dark shade 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 he is not completely black he rather 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.100
 brown-gray but on camera it is given 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.630
 for some reason it is possible to take black 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.110
 dark brown you can take dark gray 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.959
 it is undesirable to take a black shade 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.290
 or this business because the eye is more 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.030
 put it in the newest century it will be 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.620
 look not good take on 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 canted right here on this brush 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.790
 which is bundled no other 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.790
 brushes do not take you a little more 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.040
 I get closer I put 3 accent one 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.480
 accent 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.450
 will go from here somewhere to about 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 here is a second accent from the inside corner 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:36.700
 eyes and where iris begins and 3 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.280
 the accent is on the lower lash line 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.670
 over here right over the floor to 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.670
 iris 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.680
 i don't draw any arrows i 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.680
 just put accents 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.410
 at the ciliary edge and then a little bit 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.410
 water up 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:42.860
 that's the shade that mean I'm 

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:46.689
 the very first put 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:53.559
 and drink it with a touch of me when I stew 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:53.559
 inner corner is also outer 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.750
