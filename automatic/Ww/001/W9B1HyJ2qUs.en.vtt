this<00:00:33.340> year<00:00:33.960> um<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:37.000> it's<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.570> best<00:00:37.750> ever

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this year um I think it's the best ever

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.460 
this year um I think it's the best ever
because<00:00:40.000> there<00:00:40.210> are<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:40.300> many<00:00:40.629> great<00:00:40.900> matches

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
because there are so many great matches

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.100 
because there are so many great matches
and<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.210> many<00:00:43.390> upsets<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:46.739> great<00:00:47.739> weather

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and so many upsets and great weather

accepted<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:52.390> exciting

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899

nineteen<00:00:57.899> eighty-three<00:00:58.290> was<00:00:58.649> better<00:00:58.890> i<00:00:58.980> think

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
nineteen eighty-three was better i think

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.210
