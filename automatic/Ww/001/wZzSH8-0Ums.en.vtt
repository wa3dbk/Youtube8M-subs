00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
over this over the years um now probably

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.440

is going for bank shot maybe maybe I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.569 
is going for bank shot maybe maybe I
mean<00:03:06.720> he<00:03:06.900> could<00:03:07.109> pace<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.739> me<00:03:08.069> I'd<00:03:08.280> probably

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
mean he could pace the me I'd probably

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.670 
mean he could pace the me I'd probably
shoot<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.420> pasted<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.959> bank<00:03:10.230> means

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
shoot at it you pasted the bank means

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.369 
shoot at it you pasted the bank means
you<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:12.000> play<00:03:12.209> for<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.569> side<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.140> stick

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
you you just play for the side you stick

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.319 
you you just play for the side you stick
the<00:03:13.530> cue<00:03:13.739> ball<00:03:13.769> kind<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.549> area<00:03:14.909> if<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
the cue ball kind of in that area if it

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.960 
the cue ball kind of in that area if it
goes<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.870> probably<00:03:16.410> win<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.489> miss<00:03:17.760> he's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
goes you probably win if you miss he's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.420 
goes you probably win if you miss he's
probably<00:03:18.239> stuck<00:03:18.569> behind<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.049> three<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.099> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
probably stuck behind the three so you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.680 
probably stuck behind the three so you
don't<00:03:20.579> hit<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.880> hard<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.269> just<00:03:21.299> kind<00:03:21.630> of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
don't hit it hard you just kind of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.710 
don't hit it hard you just kind of
smooth<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.220> that's<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:26.849> he<00:03:26.970> did<00:03:27.000> and

smooth it in and that's what he did and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.869 
smooth it in and that's what he did and
that's<00:03:27.780> less<00:03:28.620> yeah<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.639> correct

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879

the<00:04:32.390> six<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.930> well<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.740> see<00:04:33.920> now<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.490> he

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
the six and well to see now this is he

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.490 
the six and well to see now this is he
this<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.180> one<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.600> tougher<00:04:35.930> racks<00:04:36.200> we've

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
this is one of the tougher racks we've

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.410 
this is one of the tougher racks we've
seen<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.160> whole<00:04:37.280> match<00:04:37.520> he's<00:04:37.940> got<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.270> get

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
seen in the whole match he's got to get

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.450 
seen in the whole match he's got to get
good<00:04:38.570> on<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.810> five<00:04:39.050> which<00:04:39.560> he<00:04:39.710> did<00:04:39.950> he's<00:04:40.280> got

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
good on the five which he did he's got

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.910 
good on the five which he did he's got
to<00:04:40.550> get<00:04:40.670> good<00:04:40.790> on<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.060> 6<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.630> 7<00:04:42.080> he<00:04:42.590> said<00:04:42.800> I

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
to get good on the 6 and the 7 he said I

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.330 
to get good on the 6 and the 7 he said I
mean<00:04:43.100> many<00:04:43.820> times<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.300> don't<00:04:44.450> see<00:04:44.660> this<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:46.220> he

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
mean many times you don't see this so he

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.890 
mean many times you don't see this so he
must<00:04:46.550> get<00:04:46.730> good<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.180> six<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:50.210> think

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
must get good on the six and I think

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.470 
must get good on the six and I think
yeah<00:04:51.470> he's<00:04:51.650> good<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.580> he's<00:04:52.730> gotta<00:04:52.910> go<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:53.420> you

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
yeah he's good and he's gotta go so you

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.090 
yeah he's good and he's gotta go so you
said<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.900> mean<00:04:54.080> there<00:04:54.230> was<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> lot<00:04:54.620> more<00:04:54.650> play<00:04:55.040> to

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
said I mean there was a lot more play to

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.160 
said I mean there was a lot more play to
this<00:04:55.460> particular<00:04:55.760> rack<00:04:56.240> out<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.900> all<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.890 
this particular rack out of all the
racks<00:04:57.380> we've<00:04:57.620> seen<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> nature

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
racks we've seen because of the nature

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.370 
racks we've seen because of the nature
of<00:05:00.080> how<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.320> balls<00:05:00.620> lay<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:02.480> this<00:05:02.900> was<00:05:03.110> this<00:05:03.320> is
