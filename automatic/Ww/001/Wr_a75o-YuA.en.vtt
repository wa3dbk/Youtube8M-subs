not<00:01:02.409> since<00:01:03.220> this<00:01:03.610> audio<00:01:04.119> quality<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.659> not<00:01:04.930> very

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
not since this audio quality is not very

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.090 
not since this audio quality is not very
great

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.910 

this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> another<00:01:13.530> test

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this is kind of like a another test

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.760 
this is kind of like a another test
video<00:01:15.830> because

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.090 

I<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.880> did<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> vlog<00:01:22.420> not<00:01:23.109> that<00:01:23.259> long<00:01:23.469> ago<00:01:23.530> and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I I did a vlog not that long ago and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.240 
I I did a vlog not that long ago and
that<00:01:24.549> audio<00:01:24.820> quality<00:01:25.030> was<00:01:25.299> really<00:01:25.750> crap<00:01:26.219> so<00:01:27.219> I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
that audio quality was really crap so I

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.539 
that audio quality was really crap so I
just<00:01:27.460> left<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:29.289> is<00:01:29.500> like<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.860> another

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
just left it and this is like a another

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.399 
just left it and this is like a another
test<00:01:30.880> but<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> different<00:01:31.659> video<00:01:31.869> setting

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
test but with a different video setting

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.130 
test but with a different video setting
as<00:01:32.530> well<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:34.000> video<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.420> video<00:01:34.600> setting<00:01:35.049> i'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
as well this video the video setting i'm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.040 
as well this video the video setting i'm
using<00:01:35.469> here<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.960> wide<00:01:38.170> angle<00:01:38.439> lens<00:01:39.390> 720p

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.770 

but<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.040> square<00:01:44.700> video<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> not

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
but it's a square video so it's not

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.840 
but it's a square video so it's not
going<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:47.030> good<00:01:48.030> until<00:01:48.330> I've<00:01:49.700> tried<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
going to be good until I've tried to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.540 
going to be good until I've tried to
make<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.120> wide<00:01:51.330> screen<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.410> don't<00:01:53.280> like

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
make it wide screen because I don't like

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.140 
make it wide screen because I don't like
the<00:01:54.330> video<00:01:54.660> being<00:01:54.990> square

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
the video being square

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.510 
the video being square
when<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.870> was<00:01:58.080> looking<00:01:58.470> at<00:02:00.560> videos<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
when I was looking at videos of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.460 
when I was looking at videos of the
contour<00:02:02.970> HD<00:02:03.180> before<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.140> thinking<00:02:04.410> about

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
contour HD before I was thinking about

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.450 
contour HD before I was thinking about
buying<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.840> come<00:02:06.840> across<00:02:07.140> spends<00:02:07.680> old<00:02:08.100> video

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
buying it come across spends old video

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.200 
buying it come across spends old video
of<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.590> contour<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.110> said<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:14.210> he

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
of the contour and he said that he

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.940 
of the contour and he said that he
didn't<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.600> about<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> contours<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
didn't like about the contours that it

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.590 
didn't like about the contours that it
came<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.510> files<00:02:18.750> came<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.290> an<00:02:19.380> MOV<00:02:19.830> file<00:02:20.600> that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
came the files came as an MOV file that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.700 
came the files came as an MOV file that
the<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.470> video<00:02:22.770> files<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.200> they<00:02:25.200> said<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
the the video files and they said that

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.370 
the the video files and they said that
you<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:28.490> change<00:02:29.490> them<00:02:29.730> into<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.930> mp4

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you have to change them into like mp4

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.980 
you have to change them into like mp4
avi<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:32.100> whatever<00:02:32.580> before<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.720> really

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
avi or whatever before they can really

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.970 
avi or whatever before they can really
be<00:02:34.140> used<00:02:34.410> oh<00:02:34.850> yeah<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:37.230> don't<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.740> agree

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
be used oh yeah but don't really agree

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.850 
be used oh yeah but don't really agree
with<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.150> use<00:02:40.020> Sony<00:02:40.260> Vegas<00:02:40.470> I

can stick movie files straight into Sony
Vegas<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.980> edit<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.670> no<00:02:44.820> problems<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
Vegas and edit with no problems and it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.770 
Vegas and edit with no problems and it
comes<00:02:46.500> out<00:02:46.650> as<00:02:46.830> an<00:02:46.920> mp4<00:02:47.400> format

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.170 

I<00:02:52.870> am<00:02:53.470> talking<00:02:53.680> very<00:02:54.040> quiet<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.850> don't

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
I am talking very quiet so I don't

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.250 
I am talking very quiet so I don't
actually<00:02:55.600> know<00:02:55.870> how<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:57.160> volume<00:02:57.580> will<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:58.260> or

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
actually know how the volume will be or

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.950 
actually know how the volume will be or
as<00:02:59.920> opposed<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.819> wind<00:03:01.240> noise

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.010 

maybe<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.070> stuck<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.900> don't<00:03:06.900> know

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
maybe if I it's stuck I don't know

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.880 
maybe if I it's stuck I don't know
because<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.410> wear
