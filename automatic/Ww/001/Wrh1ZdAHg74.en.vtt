00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
vlog this cram Athan experience which is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.530 
vlog this cram Athan experience which is
awkward<00:00:12.860> probably<00:00:13.860> but<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.940> wanted<00:00:15.269> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
awkward probably but I just wanted to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.910 
awkward probably but I just wanted to
kind<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.980> update<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.080> hourly<00:00:19.080> basis<00:00:19.590> on

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
kind of update more at a hourly basis on

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.970 
kind of update more at a hourly basis on
video<00:00:20.340> rather<00:00:20.699> than<00:00:20.850> tweets<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> thought

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
video rather than tweets so I thought

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
video rather than tweets so I thought
this<00:00:23.100> would<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> best<00:00:23.820> option<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:25.080> just

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
this would be the best option so I just

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
this would be the best option so I just
had<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> finish<00:00:25.859> writing<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.369> fanfiction<00:00:27.210> for
