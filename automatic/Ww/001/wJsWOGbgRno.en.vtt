00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
give herself warmth then winter would

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.080 
give herself warmth then winter would
kind<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.859> drag<00:03:40.099> on<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.519> it'll<00:03:40.639> be<00:03:40.699> much<00:03:40.909> longer

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
kind of drag on and it'll be much longer
