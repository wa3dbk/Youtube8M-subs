00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.439
 which philips 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.169
 These video cards below we see and hear how your guitar and voice are, however 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.360
 that is easy if you do not work an external device or the piano from the 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.359
 or give the internet the right tone 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.169
 stronger on bear shot 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.949
 it is based on scissors and that is handy because it can be left behind once 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.590
 Groups that don't put apple right 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.590
 then you also go to the fifth position 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280
 that is thanks to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 matches your heart 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 it doesn't matter to me that's good 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.929
 stopped at the australian 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.929
 of course you go to the fifth position the package d 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 it boils down to this name 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.360
 I also think it is on the relegant to go back to fifth position not thinking that 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.140
 is already know then it went wrong 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.170
 citizens rightly so 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.650
 to call the or 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.200
 and there he comes watching the party on which he moves to the fourth position 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.830
 and there is your mouth 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
 and on the animal market you are in fifth position again 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 how does this agree with you once 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 You have badly damaged the two and brought the highest wages into control 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530
 rise 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.810
 grab it a second to draw the second position or may not determine 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.909
 The report jacket on it remains an agreement currently 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.890
 so again 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 on all locks to the fifth position except 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.580
 I stand 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.810
 everything to the fifth position 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.210
 fourth position in Kerkrade 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 good luck with stars
