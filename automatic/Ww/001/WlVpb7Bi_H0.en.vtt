PEGI<00:00:01.490> 3

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:12.970 

I<00:00:10.930> think<00:00:11.930> there<00:00:12.020> was<00:00:12.139> a<00:00:12.170> lot<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.350> limitations

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.529 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:13.100> our<00:00:13.219> old<00:00:13.400> collision<00:00:13.850> system<00:00:14.180> it<00:00:14.270> was<00:00:14.330> very

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.150 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:14.779> but<00:00:15.020> it<00:00:15.199> didn't<00:00:15.410> allow<00:00:15.559> us<00:00:15.590> to<00:00:15.740> do<00:00:15.920> some

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.220 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:16.609> were<00:00:17.090> quite<00:00:17.420> difficult<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.199> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.779 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:18.410> of<00:00:18.440> times<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.830> FIFA<00:00:19.130> 11<00:00:19.490> you'd<00:00:19.609> get<00:00:19.759> a

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
lot of times in FIFA 11 you'd get a

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.609 
lot of times in FIFA 11 you'd get a
situation<00:00:20.449> where<00:00:20.630> maybe<00:00:20.750> two<00:00:21.109> players<00:00:21.410> are

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.820 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:21.769> into<00:00:22.699> one<00:00:22.970> another<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:23.830> because

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
running into one another and because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.829 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:25.519> a<00:00:25.609> lot<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:25.849> contacts<00:00:26.390> between<00:00:26.570> those

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.810 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:26.990> players<00:00:27.230> with<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.039> old<00:00:28.160> system<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:28.669> had

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.120 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:28.939> pick<00:00:29.150> one<00:00:29.630> contact<00:00:30.259> which<00:00:30.859> meant<00:00:31.070> that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.860 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:31.310> get<00:00:31.460> it<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:31.730> collision<00:00:32.119> animation<00:00:32.720> that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
we'd get it a collision animation that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.150 
we'd get it a collision animation that
did<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.020> great<00:00:33.260> job<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.500> showing<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:34.010> that

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
did a great job of showing you that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.560 
did a great job of showing you that
there<00:00:34.310> was<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.460> collision<00:00:34.730> something<00:00:35.210> happened

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
there was a collision something happened

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.060 
there was a collision something happened
but<00:00:35.690> maybe<00:00:35.840> didn't<00:00:36.200> take<00:00:36.320> into<00:00:36.500> account<00:00:36.590> every

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
but maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.920 
but maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:37.310> detail<00:00:37.670> with<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:38.330> year's<00:00:38.570> engine

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.390 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.170> see<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.590> when<00:00:39.800> those<00:00:39.890> two<00:00:40.130> players

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.100 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:40.640> together<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.150> resolving<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.870> every

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.770 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:42.410> collision<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.890> happens<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:44.210> we're

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.470 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:45.380> able<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.860> preserve<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.400> momentum<00:00:46.940> a

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.030 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:47.930> better<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.410> interactions<00:00:48.980> between

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.910 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:50.660> looks<00:00:50.930> fantastic<00:00:51.140> when<00:00:51.830> you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.830 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:00:52.040> into<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.340> replay<00:00:52.700> camera<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.570> see

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.620 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.550> limbs<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.850> parts<00:00:56.120> bending

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.180 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:00:56.780> contorting<00:00:57.260> as<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.530> would<00:00:57.680> expect<00:00:57.770> them

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.160 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:00:58.220> like<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.910> would<00:00:59.060> see<00:00:59.240> on<00:00:59.270> real<00:00:59.570> world<00:00:59.720> TV

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
to like you would see on real world TV

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.500 
to like you would see on real world TV
but<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.680> also<00:01:00.860> translates<00:01:01.490> into<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> telecom

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.719 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.440> really<00:01:03.710> feel<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:04.189> difference<00:01:04.549> of

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:05.890 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:04.939> game<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.360> really<00:01:05.420> feel<00:01:05.840> about

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
the game and you really feel about

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.800 
the game and you really feel about
preservation<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.740> momentum<00:01:07.390> another<00:01:08.390> benefit

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:08.990> get<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.499> we<00:01:10.159> resolve<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.579> lot<00:01:10.640> of<00:01:10.700> our

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.330 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our
clipping<00:01:11.479> issues<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.929> the<00:01:11.990> game<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.380> year<00:01:12.439> in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.889 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:13.880> year's<00:01:14.149> system<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:14.570> didn't<00:01:14.780> actually

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
last year's system we didn't actually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.630 
last year's system we didn't actually
account<00:01:15.289> for<00:01:15.380> arm<00:01:15.619> collisions<00:01:16.009> at<00:01:16.130> all<00:01:16.280> and

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.849 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:16.850> couldn't<00:01:17.119> really<00:01:17.420> tell<00:01:17.719> in<00:01:18.049> in<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.770 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:19.249> but<00:01:19.429> if<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.609> wanted<00:01:19.819> to<00:01:19.880> replay<00:01:20.299> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.289 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:20.990> notice<00:01:21.439> that<00:01:21.909> arms<00:01:22.909> could<00:01:23.119> sometimes

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.029 
would notice that arms could sometimes
click<00:01:23.780> through<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.049> shoulder<00:01:24.499> or<00:01:24.530> clip<00:01:24.829> through

year<00:01:27.380> we're<00:01:27.530> resolving<00:01:27.979> every<00:01:28.249> single

don't<00:01:34.429> actually<00:01:34.670> get<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.030> level<00:01:35.299> of<00:01:35.389> clipping

shielding<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.579> get<00:01:43.990> more<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.170> tussle

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
shielding you get more of a tussle

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.809 
shielding you get more of a tussle
between<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.920> players<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.429> fight<00:01:46.609> for

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
between the players and a fight for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.279 
between the players and a fight for
possession<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.299> feels<00:01:47.569> more<00:01:47.780> realistic

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
possession that feels more realistic

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.569 
possession that feels more realistic
feels<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.740> things<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.069> you<00:01:49.189> might<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.549> on

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
feels like things that you might see on

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.270 
feels like things that you might see on
TV<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:51.350> illustrate<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.770> point<00:01:51.920> about<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
TV to illustrate the point about the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.770 
TV to illustrate the point about the
variety<00:01:52.789> we<00:01:52.939> get<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.270> want<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.479> talk<00:01:53.630> about

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.749 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:01:54.350> dribble<00:01:54.740> terms<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.189> what<00:01:55.639> this

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
contextual dribble terms and what this

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.149 
contextual dribble terms and what this
is<00:01:55.969> is<00:01:56.179> using<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.869> left<00:01:57.049> stick<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.979> could

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
is is using the left stick you could

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.830 
is is using the left stick you could
beat<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.369> player<00:01:58.639> last<00:01:58.880> year<00:01:59.119> by<00:01:59.270> maybe<00:01:59.479> taking

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
beat a player last year by maybe taking

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.239 
beat a player last year by maybe taking
just<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.109> forty<00:02:00.350> five-degree<00:02:00.619> dribble<00:02:01.069> term

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
just a forty five-degree dribble term

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.179 
just a forty five-degree dribble term
but<00:02:02.350> sometimes<00:02:03.350> when<00:02:03.499> you<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.950> maybe

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
but sometimes when you do that maybe

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.379 
but sometimes when you do that maybe
you'd<00:02:04.340> knock<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.639> ball<00:02:04.759> by<00:02:04.999> him<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.299> that

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
you'd knock the ball by him and that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:06.969 
you'd knock the ball by him and that
player<00:02:05.630> would<00:02:05.869> stick<00:02:06.079> out<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> leg<00:02:06.469> trying<00:02:06.889> to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
player would stick out a leg trying to

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.949 
player would stick out a leg trying to
tackle<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.490> or<00:02:07.700> really<00:02:08.330> be<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.600> way<00:02:08.780> of

tackle you or really be in the way of

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
where you're trying to go after the ball

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.100 
where you're trying to go after the ball
has<00:02:10.130> passed<00:02:10.490> him<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.569> when<00:02:11.689> you<00:02:11.780> add<00:02:11.930> this

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
has passed him so when you add this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.170 
has passed him so when you add this
year's<00:02:12.379> engine<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:12.860> top<00:02:13.129> of<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.730> contextual

would see on television happening in the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.330 
would see on television happening in the

leg to tackle and the dribbler tries to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.240 
leg to tackle and the dribbler tries to
jump<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.470> way<00:02:27.560> but<00:02:27.710> he<00:02:27.800> gets<00:02:27.980> caught

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
jump out of the way but he gets caught

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.030 
jump out of the way but he gets caught
and<00:02:28.490> he<00:02:28.940> goes<00:02:29.090> down<00:02:29.330> but<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> way<00:02:30.350> he's<00:02:30.620> trying

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and he goes down but the way he's trying

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
to jump out of the tackle and the way

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.060 
to jump out of the tackle and the way
that<00:02:32.780> his<00:02:32.870> legs<00:02:33.110> bend<00:02:33.410> because<00:02:33.620> he's<00:02:33.890> been

that his legs bend because he's been

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.860 
that his legs bend because he's been
caught<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.730> creates<00:02:35.180> another<00:02:35.450> level<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
caught it creates another level of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.060 
caught it creates another level of
variety<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.380> we<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.680> wouldn't<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:36.980> had

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
variety that we just wouldn't have had

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.510 
variety that we just wouldn't have had
in<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> game<00:02:37.460> last<00:02:37.700> year<00:02:38.170> further<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.350> that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
in the game last year further to that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.590 
in the game last year further to that
what<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:40.760> see<00:02:40.910> something<00:02:41.240> now<00:02:41.360> is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
what you can see something now is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.930 
what you can see something now is
sometimes<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.230> dribbler<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.860> knock<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.850> ball

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
sometimes a dribbler will knock the ball

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.460 
sometimes a dribbler will knock the ball
by<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> defender<00:02:44.630> using<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.050> these<00:02:45.170> dribble

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
by a defender using one of these dribble

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.870 
by a defender using one of these dribble
turns<00:02:45.650> jump<00:02:45.980> out<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> way<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.670> gets

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
turns jump out of the way and gets

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.850 
turns jump out of the way and gets
caught<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.720> slightly<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.470> he<00:02:48.560> takes<00:02:48.710> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
caught but just slightly so he takes a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.680 
caught but just slightly so he takes a
small<00:02:49.100> knock<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.180> get<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> little

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
small knock and what you get is a little

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.270 
small knock and what you get is a little
bit<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.170> resilience<00:02:51.830> from<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> player

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
bit more of resilience from the player

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
bit more of resilience from the player
to<00:02:52.460> take<00:02:52.610> those<00:02:52.790> small<00:02:53.000> knocks<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.540> able<00:02:54.020> to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
to take those small knocks and able to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.320 
to take those small knocks and able to
continue<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.950> go<00:02:55.100> after<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.520> ball<00:02:55.700> now

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
continue on and go after the ball now

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.030 
continue on and go after the ball now
players<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.870> Messi<00:02:57.020> can<00:02:57.440> skip<00:02:57.890> through

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
players like Messi can skip through

players like Messi can skip through
those<00:02:58.220> challenge<00:02:58.640> take<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> knock<00:02:59.210> bounce<00:02:59.690> off

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
those challenge take a knock bounce off

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.720 
those challenge take a knock bounce off
of<00:02:59.960> a<00:03:00.170> tackle<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.650> still<00:03:00.920> continue<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
of a tackle and still continue on to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.700 
of a tackle and still continue on to
really<00:03:02.240> pursue<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.630> ball<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.050> continue<00:03:03.590> the

flow<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.130> game<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.460> it<00:03:04.790> makes<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> much

flow of the game and it makes for a much

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.970 
flow of the game and it makes for a much
more<00:03:05.360> exciting<00:03:05.720> experience<00:03:06.380> especially<00:03:06.590> when

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
more exciting experience especially when
