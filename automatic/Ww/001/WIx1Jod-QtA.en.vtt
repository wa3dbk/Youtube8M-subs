County<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.530> thought<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> county<00:01:02.550> in

agriculture and was struggling long

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.219 
agriculture and was struggling long
before<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.479> 24<00:01:09.479> regulations<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
before we got here 24 regulations that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
before we got here 24 regulations that
would<00:01:10.380> preserve<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.920> rural<00:01:11.189> character<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
would preserve the rural character is

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
would preserve the rural character is
generally<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> term<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:13.260> people<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
generally the term that people use and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
generally the term that people use and
so<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> only<00:01:15.869> incall<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> only

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so that is only incall that is only

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.210 
so that is only incall that is only
increased<00:01:17.520> since<00:01:17.700> 1973<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> given

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
increased since 1973 this is on a given

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
increased since 1973 this is on a given
day<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> past<00:01:22.229> several<00:01:22.470> years<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.860> would

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
day in the past several years this would

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
day in the past several years this would
be<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> fast<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> three

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
be one of the fast one of the three

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
be one of the fast one of the three
fastest<00:01:24.750> growing<00:01:24.960> counties<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.500> country

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
fastest growing counties in the country

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.810 
fastest growing counties in the country
so<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.240> county<00:01:27.930> represents<00:01:28.890> urban

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so this this county represents urban

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
so this this county represents urban
pressure<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.360> rural<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.869> goodborough<00:01:31.470> land<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pressure on rural on goodborough land I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
pressure on rural on goodborough land I
mean<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.189> very<00:01:32.460> representative<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
mean it's very representative and this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
mean it's very representative and this
county<00:01:34.259> has<00:01:34.290> gone<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.189> numerous<00:01:35.689> efforts

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
county has gone through numerous efforts

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.440 
county has gone through numerous efforts
to<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.439> zoning<00:01:37.860> regulations<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:39.030> kinds

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to put zoning regulations or other kinds

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.530 
to put zoning regulations or other kinds
of<00:01:39.509> regulations<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.290> land<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> keep<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> open

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
of regulations on land to keep it open

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.370 
of regulations on land to keep it open
so<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.430> direction<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.380> away

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
so I would say the direction is away

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.569 
so I would say the direction is away
from<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.740> being<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> rural<00:01:47.939> county<00:01:48.119> just

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
from it being a rural county just

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
from it being a rural county just
inevitably<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> same<00:01:52.020> time<00:01:52.200> there

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
inevitably but at the same time there

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
inevitably but at the same time there
have<00:01:52.590> sprung<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.189> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> different<00:01:53.700> kinds

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
have sprung up a lot of different kinds

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.789 
have sprung up a lot of different kinds
of<00:01:54.299> agricultural<00:01:54.899> operations<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.649> are

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
of agricultural operations which are

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530 
of agricultural operations which are
typically<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.399> land<00:01:56.729> extensive<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.360> land

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
typically not land extensive but land

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
typically not land extensive but land
intensive<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.229> typically<00:01:58.950> relate<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
intensive and typically relate to the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039 
intensive and typically relate to the
market<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.210> fashion<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> can

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
market in a different fashion so you can

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.440 
market in a different fashion so you can
see<00:02:01.320> people<00:02:02.130> commercially<00:02:02.640> trying<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.060> adapt

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
see people commercially trying to adapt

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.319 
see people commercially trying to adapt
to<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.439> possible<00:02:04.909> well<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.030> started

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
to what is now possible well we started

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.630 
to what is now possible well we started
out<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> farm<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.860> started<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.310> growing

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
out as a farm and we started out growing

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.440 
out as a farm and we started out growing
herbs<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.300> vegetables<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.170> then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
herbs and vegetables and then

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.150 
herbs and vegetables and then
we<00:02:10.599> went<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.929> farmers<00:02:11.379> markets<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.950> from

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
we went to farmers markets and from

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.970 
we went to farmers markets and from
farmers<00:02:12.520> markets<00:02:12.879> then<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.650> decided<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.769> we

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.059 
wave it grow around tears I think farms
are<00:02:34.209> getting<00:02:34.420> smaller<00:02:34.660> at<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.470> point<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.010> I

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
are getting smaller at this point and I

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.440 
are getting smaller at this point and I
think<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.519> what's<00:02:36.670> happening<00:02:37.090> though<00:02:37.269> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
think that what's happening though is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.910 
think that what's happening though is
that<00:02:37.480> you're<00:02:37.750> having<00:02:37.870> people<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.500> are<00:02:38.620> now

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
that you're having people that are now

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.460 
that you're having people that are now
growing<00:02:39.370> more<00:02:39.700> specialty<00:02:40.209> crops<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.810> so

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
growing more specialty crops and so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.949 
growing more specialty crops and so
they're<00:02:41.769> they're<00:02:42.220> actually<00:02:42.819> growing<00:02:43.540> things

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
they're they're actually growing things

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.009 
they're they're actually growing things

me<00:04:36.700> thinking<00:04:37.060> was<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.300> idea<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.770> food

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
me thinking was the idea that that food

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.660 
me thinking was the idea that that food
is<00:04:39.640> not<00:04:39.820> cheap<00:04:39.880> good<00:04:40.840> food<00:04:41.170> is<00:04:41.440> not<00:04:42.070> cheap<00:04:42.130> and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
is not cheap good food is not cheap and

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.940 
is not cheap good food is not cheap and
it<00:04:42.790> can't<00:04:43.000> be<00:04:43.150> cheap<00:04:43.390> because<00:04:43.960> it's<00:04:44.740> so

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
it can't be cheap because it's so

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.130 
it can't be cheap because it's so
valuable<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:45.880> it's<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.510> valid
