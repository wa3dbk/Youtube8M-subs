00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello friends and in this video I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.009
 I want to tell you a little about 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 speed controller 3 pin cooler 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.250
 on the cpu cooling system and on 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.949
 cooling system of its own 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.130
 personal computer and this and that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 turnover controller was bundled with 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.420
 cooler 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 from zalman to processor 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:38.700
 accordingly this controller to me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 got from a friend he gave it to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.760
 accordingly, well, I still came to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 the shop asked how much it cost and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.270
 oddly enough there was about here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.870
 absolutely also more accurate looking 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.350
 rpm controller and respectively 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.809
 it cost around 220 rubles 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.989
 Respectively penny he nouneym here 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.299
 no inscriptions mean input 3 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.520
 power pin on the output too 3 pin power 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.420
 so why I bought it now 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.580
 I'll tell you, I have two 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.479
 motherboards gigabyte means 970 a 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 ds3 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.100
 on socket means m 3 + chipset them 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.100
 installed as already guessed 970 and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 it's amazing that I have two 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.770
 absolutely identical maternal 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.649
 motherboard the only difference 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 what do you see on 1 nut 30 on the other 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.479
 lion 1.1 so here is a burrow at 30 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.869
 I understand a newer version of the new new 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.869
 bios and unfortunately it turned out that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.049
 this virus does not support mean 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.430
 rev control well and just 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.070
 adjustment of turns on 3 pin 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.760
 coolers therefore on the old maternal 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.509
 fees 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.910
 Well, on one, as more precisely, the computer f11 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.230
 I worked great three pin 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.720
 cooler on the processor by the way here it is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.380
 so here is the cooling system 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.900
 cooling from titan called ti ti si 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.080
 inca 35 test-drive.ru and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 I would like to say that I am long 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.940
 tormented reinstalled bios and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.760
 and unfortunately despite everything means 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.130
 connected cooler, he gave a little well 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 Do not maximize momentum and constantly well 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.810
 accordingly a lot of noise 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.790
 I have already tried to change bios downloaded 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.510
 various programs on 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 mean control turns and nothing 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.820
 it helped I downloaded you immediately say neither 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.830
 one program is very much carried on 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.290
 for a long time trying to adjust the bios 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:16.209
 reflash beus and nothing is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.190
 Well, actually helped in so here I am 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.430
 already connected to one side now 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.080
 on the other hand we connect already 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.580
 power from our cooler on the system 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:32.519
 CPU cooling and so i did it 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:36.910
 and accordingly we need means 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.830
 Like this, I'll post it for now 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.340
 regulate momentum and so need 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.340
 turn on the computer and now you can 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.340
 hear 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.220
 I mean but first of all because 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.070
 the cooler was working by itself 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.120
 well at the very beginning as you hear it 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.620
 now itâ€™s pretty loud buzzing and 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.040
 here is a goal he 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.349
 not pleasant enough and now I will show 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.830
 how could it be possible with the help of such 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.769
 devices to reduce speed and so can 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.640
 measure with a sound meter in the phone 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.640
 let's measure 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.949
 as you can see the noise is about 50 decibels 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.760
 well now let's reduce 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.760
 turnovers 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.229
 as you hear now the cooler has become 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.250
 much quieter and let's measure now 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.250
 even a little smaller 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:02.090
 here 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.090
 and let's measure 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.700
 as you can see the difference is almost 20 decibels 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.700
 which is very significant 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.889
 That's all that's here is 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.970
 wonderful device unfortunately she 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.610
 no name but still deserve their 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.800
 attention and already repeat despite the fact 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.199
 that this device came with 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.810
 cooler or cooling system for 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.860
 processor zalman 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.220
 however I saw the same device 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.470
 separately sold looks absolutely 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:03.280
 also costs around 220 rubles hopefully 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.550
 you liked the video to all the best 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.550
