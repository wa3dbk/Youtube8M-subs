 it's hard to define what are for you 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 everyone thinks in the space of two weeks from the beginning of the euro 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.150
 but here 2010 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.480

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.310
 land in front of the house 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.790

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.630

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.960

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 to counter the paintings exposed this context 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 but there is a couple that can be brought with me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.090
 The crazier we are 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.430
 I'm happy to see you again 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 I almost like them berry-comeau 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 why did you change he says he 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 I ended up opening my eyes 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 my name is dangote follow the professional 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 for years I tried in vain to erase memory 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 all my memories of kidnapping 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.039
 now that I assume them 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 he lives in terror most of the time 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.859
 I know they will come back for 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 they always come back 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.199
 my name is causse keynectis 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.149
 I am a housewife 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 and I believe that there is no reason to be afraid 2 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.239
 I think it's very much a film whose role is in the country 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.389
 and it's a human reaction in a clinic 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.669
 i'm trying margareth sc 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.669
 I worked the stock market 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.199
 I am proud to have been chosen where he is barred 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.319
 I think we all have a chance 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.529
 very particular 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.629
 we are chosen to be the participants in a mysterious project and 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.629
 I respect and martin in celebration 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.049
 only the pieces 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.259
 I am against meters 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.349
 we are guinea pigs 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.419
 and nothing else 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.909
 specimens 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.909
 they've been manipulated all my life since I was little 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.199
 without asking permission 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.699
 they never asked for anything 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.569
 you know what's worse 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.209
 if only 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.209
 ridicule 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.859
 we doubt ourselves 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.859
 we come to believe that we are qualified 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.369
 and in general 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.199
 they have three that we are if he succeeds m 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.739
 she's right what's the hardest part how many of them were 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 children during their first abduction 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.399
 because that's often how it starts 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.719
 for the majority 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.809
 well i asked alex look and come with me tonight because 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.289
 but I believe that members of this group more than anyone and at 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.289
 world can understand what they feel 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.759
 we listen to the weeks 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.759
 we all had terrible things 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.009
 I criticize ste 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 they come to take what was needed 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.180
 it belongs to m 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.409
 a priority 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.499
 they are caught moby dick 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.499
 it happened to my wife too 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.309
 his guilt 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.309
 nothing I told him but since the summer 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.300
 but nothing worked 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.580
 but there is something you can do 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.060
 but I can try to help you overcome the trauma you have 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.460
 suffered 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.659
 integrate into your life 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.879
 so that you give up 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.879
 and all these feelings of shame and two 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.050
 sinless connolly was to start over a source 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.309
 for rescuers 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.270

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.339

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.860
 nobody in your position 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.619
 never had the courage to approach the subject 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:36.599
 it's a unique opportunity 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.580
 people who are advancing new ideas without dealing with harm at all to 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.990
