think<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
think that that's that's what we see and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
think that that's that's what we see and
even<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.990> his<00:01:28.110> kit<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.460> into<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
even in his kit will get into kind of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
even in his kit will get into kind of
the<00:01:30.150> specifics<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> major

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the specifics around one of the major

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.410 
the specifics around one of the major
mechanics<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.280> associated<00:01:32.939> ratatat<00:01:33.270> occur

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
mechanics that associated ratatat occur

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
mechanics that associated ratatat occur
but<00:01:33.540> generally<00:01:34.320> speaking<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.710> kit<00:01:34.950> his

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
but generally speaking his kit his

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
but generally speaking his kit his
ultimate<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.570> jumping<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:36.990> branch

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
ultimate is you know jumping from branch

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
ultimate is you know jumping from branch
to<00:01:37.290> branch<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.310> he<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> dash

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to branch right is he is kind of a dash

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
to branch right is he is kind of a dash
that<00:01:39.900> has<00:01:40.020> conditional<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.710> dashes<00:01:41.100> apart

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that has conditional more dashes apart

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
that has conditional more dashes apart
he<00:01:41.939> bounces<00:01:42.329> around<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.810> seems<00:01:43.049> very

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
he bounces around he seems very

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
he bounces around he seems very
high-energy<00:01:43.619> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.130> frenetic<00:01:44.280> pace<00:01:44.720> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
high-energy kind of frenetic pace and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.450 
high-energy kind of frenetic pace and
even<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.439> his<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> things<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
even like his one of the things that I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.590 
even like his one of the things that I
see<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.479> like

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
see that I think is really need is like

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
see that I think is really need is like
once<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.560> combat<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
once you're in combat kind of what the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
once you're in combat kind of what the
treatment<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.869> yeah<00:01:52.140> there's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
treatment is for that right yeah there's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
treatment is for that right yeah there's
a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> challenge<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.180> small

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
a lot of challenge really small

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.910 
a lot of challenge really small
characters<00:01:54.630> making<00:01:54.960> sure<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.439> feel<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
characters making sure they feel the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
characters making sure they feel the
range<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.430> their<00:01:56.549> male<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> making<00:01:57.719> sure<00:01:57.840> they

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
range of their male and making sure they

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.789 
range of their male and making sure they
actually<00:01:58.110> makes<00:01:58.259> sense<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.590> they're<00:01:58.680> there

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
actually makes sense that they're there

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
actually makes sense that they're there
in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> battle<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.610> say<00:01:59.790> they<00:01:59.939> feel

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
in the battle and they say they feel

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
in the battle and they say they feel
like<00:02:00.240> they're<00:02:00.659> strong<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.049> magical<00:02:01.740> enough

like they're strong and magical enough

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
like they're strong and magical enough
to<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.969> also<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.479> stuff<00:02:03.689> like

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to be there but also you know stuff like

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.600 
to be there but also you know stuff like
buff<00:02:04.140> belts<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.070> things<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.430> you're

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
buff belts and really things like you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
he's so small a lot of challenges we had

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.360 
he's so small a lot of challenges we had
overcome<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.470> also<00:02:17.620> because<00:02:17.890> he's<00:02:18.190> actually

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you know one of our very very few

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.260 
you know one of our very very few
nonhumanoid<00:02:21.160> characters<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.030> had<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> lot

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
nonhumanoid characters that we had a lot

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.150 
nonhumanoid characters that we had a lot
of<00:02:22.300> fun<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.690> how<00:02:23.170> he<00:02:23.230> moves<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.980> how<00:02:24.100> he

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
interacts and also we got a lot of

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.060 
interacts and also we got a lot of
squirrelly<00:02:26.170> things<00:02:26.380> if<00:02:26.500> he<00:02:26.560> flips<00:02:26.800> around<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
squirrelly things if he flips around and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.160 
squirrelly things if he flips around and
spins<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.910> round<00:02:28.090> he's<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.630> very<00:02:28.810> fast

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
spins and just round he's a very fast

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.480 
spins and just round he's a very fast
character<00:02:29.680> log<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.980> came<00:02:30.160> through<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.430> his

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
character log that came through in his

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.580 
character log that came through in his
gameplay<00:02:30.820> yeah<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.600> well<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.110> kinda

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
gameplay yeah I think as well so I kinda

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.650 
gameplay yeah I think as well so I kinda
hinted<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.890> earlier<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.610> big<00:02:33.910> portion<00:02:34.210> of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
hinted at earlier but a big portion of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.450 
hinted at earlier but a big portion of
what<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> design<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.560> for<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.860> god<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
what the design is for this god and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.400 
what the design is for this god and
ultimately<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> gameplay<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:38.110> nut

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
ultimately the gameplay is this nut

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.340 
ultimately the gameplay is this nut
mechanic<00:02:38.950> he<00:02:39.550> has<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> magical<00:02:40.390> nut<00:02:40.690> that's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
mechanic he has a magical nut that's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.460 
mechanic he has a magical nut that's
part<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.710> one<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.010> his<00:02:42.190> abilities<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
part of one of his abilities and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.110 
part of one of his abilities and
audiences<00:02:44.470> abilities<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.860> should<00:02:45.010> say<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.400> he

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
audiences abilities I should say and he

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.660 
audiences abilities I should say and he
can<00:02:46.300> purchase<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.380> item<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.430> unique

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
can purchase this item and so unique

will all get his abilities there to kind

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.510 
will all get his abilities there to kind
of<00:02:52.959> major<00:02:53.230> split<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.220> break<00:02:54.400> that

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
of major split so can you break that

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.490 
of major split so can you break that
down<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.760> little<00:02:54.910> bit<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.230> can

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
down a little bit and and if you can

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
down a little bit and and if you can
give<00:02:56.680> us<00:02:56.770> some<00:02:56.800> insight<00:02:56.980> into<00:02:57.420> where<00:02:58.420> that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
give us some insight into where that

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.199 
give us some insight into where that
idea<00:02:58.660> synthesized<00:02:59.230> from<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.680> how<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.610> kind<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
idea synthesized from and how it kind of

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.790 
idea synthesized from and how it kind of
its<00:03:01.660> journey<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.080> guess<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.350> make<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.560> into<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
its journey I guess to make it into the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.250 
its journey I guess to make it into the
game<00:03:02.950> he<00:03:03.459> was<00:03:03.550> actually<00:03:03.670> probably<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.900> far<00:03:05.140> at

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
game he was actually probably so far at

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.570 
game he was actually probably so far at
least<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.590> year<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:06.010> most<00:03:06.100> complicated

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
least this year the most complicated

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.310 
least this year the most complicated
character<00:03:07.000> we've<00:03:07.090> had<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.630> mean<00:03:07.959> the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
character we've had to do I mean the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.050 
character we've had to do I mean the
breadth<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.860> what<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.760> don't<00:03:09.910> have<00:03:10.000> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
breadth of what you don't have to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.550 
breadth of what you don't have to
accomplish<00:03:10.360> their<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.900> amount<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> affection

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
accomplish their the amount of affection

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.990 
accomplish their the amount of affection
and<00:03:11.860> creations<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.520> do<00:03:12.640> with<00:03:12.790> him

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
and creations you have to do with him

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
and creations you have to do with him
but<00:03:13.630> really<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.410> kind<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.650> finding

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
but really it's you know kind of finding

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.650 
but really it's you know kind of finding
what<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:15.700> meant<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.120> most<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.630> that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
what really meant the most in that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.660 
what really meant the most in that

augmentation right being able to create

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
augmentation right being able to create
things<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.360> mattered<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.080> things<00:03:20.290> that

you<00:04:15.220> think<00:04:15.400> for<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:15.580> character<00:04:15.700> does<00:04:16.209> he

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
you think for this character does he

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.150 
you think for this character does he
have<00:04:16.390> viability<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:17.440> know<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.560> little<00:04:17.830> bit<00:04:17.979> of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
have viability you know a little bit of

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.860 
have viability you know a little bit of
kind<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.669> what<00:04:18.789> you're<00:04:18.910> explaining<00:04:19.209> here<00:04:19.479> with

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
kind of what you're explaining here with

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.409 
kind of what you're explaining here with
how<00:04:20.020> you<00:04:20.080> can<00:04:20.289> augment<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:21.030> unique<00:04:22.030> item

the<00:04:28.130> jungle<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.670> really<00:04:28.850> here's<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.120> see<00:04:29.270> if

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
the jungle and really here's to see if

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.030 
the jungle and really here's to see if
people<00:04:29.600> can<00:04:29.870> actually<00:04:29.990> make<00:04:30.230> him<00:04:30.380> work<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.800> in

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
people can actually make him work in in

making sure the Acorn variations were in

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
making sure the Acorn variations were in
the<00:05:49.190> right<00:05:49.310> spot<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.700> everything<00:05:50.000> make<00:05:50.120> sense
