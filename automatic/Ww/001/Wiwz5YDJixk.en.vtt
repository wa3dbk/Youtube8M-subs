 always pick up the bunny behind the point 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.660
 like this 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.450
 we reach the end of the work and until the last point before the second round 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.840
 doing this until the end 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 how we work the basis of our planet 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.559
 I worked my career to the very last 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.609
 before the end the marker 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.989
 ophir the piece 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.560
 make a chain between the products now on the first picking point 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.489
 just a thread of back room are all the ethics and conduct of the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.739
 a chain 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 two premieres 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.459
 We're going to work like we said nothing. 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 always taking lunch after each 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.199
 only the southeast and 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.189
 Every time you live and the career you will pick up in the back house 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.339
 always like this 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:08.379
 you will continue working this way port 22 centimeters 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.400
 to reach the final the quartet films and move to August 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:20.199
 we work on whether to accept the proposal of 22 centimeters became this way 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.439
 who thought he was in his fifties under pressure 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.959
 You'll get the tip. 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.859
 the beginning already has 60 points 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.999
 and will get to land the corresponding 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.039
 if we go home 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.439

 and he made the general law of space to attack 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.599
 I know sometimes it feels right in front of the other area 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.019
 but we will sew here around 5 centimeters 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:06.669
 no need at resacada stayed a little bigger than our table 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.249
 we think 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.139
 only five senses 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.560
 abc can stay in your company 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.729

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 this Tuesday 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.499
 such advantage 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.229
 let's finish now 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.939
 to finish and reward a movie or a certain point 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.210
 precisely its insured 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.009
 at the base of the currents 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.779
 a high point 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:42.590
 succeed 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 it's not the same place 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.210
 neither in front 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.270
 with which the entire network 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.270
 3 when your partners 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.479
 said nothing 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.360
 to score 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.900
 in the same diary 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.050
 not punctual 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 clamp forward 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.659
 Work that way all around. 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.419
 and do the same thing for the cards 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.870
 if you accept the effective treatment 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.880
 finish in toronto will look like this
