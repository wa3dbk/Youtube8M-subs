00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.320
 ok hello how are you welcome to this 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.629
 new video in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.919
 how to put a habit to their nodes 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.079
 This custom contains all the 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.820
 functions of the galaxy not three as the 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:21.050
 command and multitasking 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.610
 and optimized but it's today on the basis 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.060
 of the moon state 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.010
 of 4.3 then it is a 4.3 version of 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.400
 jilin but with all the options 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.770
 that brings the neutral is then then I go 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.840
 to divide the video into two parts in one 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.370
 We are going to install a custom cover and 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.440
 in the second part then we are going to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.690
 install itself red itself then 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.540
 here we are going to install what is first 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 the habit to eat and so 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.100
 we need three files 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.290
 I'm going to teach them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.450
 is this 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.150
 what is this let's say the cost in 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.040
 recovery as such and the odin and the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.920
 samsung drivers already know that here 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.100
 below I leave the link so that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 carry directly 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.369
 to the servers so they can 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 download here there are once they have 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.060
 done that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.110
 all they are going to do is have 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 turn off your device 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.130
 and this and we are going to enter the mode 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.950
 Advanced recovery in download mode I'm 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.710
 leaving the power button pressed 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.790
 home button and volume button down to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.560
 same time so then let's go 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.410
 I'm making this video very fast 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 because I do not want to fall behind and I do not want 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.930
 to do it very long when everyone 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.070
 you should know to be these 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.900
 ok options 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.170
 then the warning then appears 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.380
 we give it volume up 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.719
 and we enter download mode 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.960
 ok then let's move on to the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.030
 computer to teach them how is it 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.649
 every way I will continue recording with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.649
 the phone so they can see 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.350
 Then the next thing will be 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.970
 this connect your computer to the computer 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.520
 and when they hear that sound they're going to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.780
 leave here and I'll leave it 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.780
 because you can appreciate it 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 ok then if we are here in our 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.069
 pc 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.810
 how can you see 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.260
 and here we have the two files 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.840
 necessary and well then this 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.350
 we are going to open today here in the option of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.330
 ap we are going to click 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.720
 we go to the desk where you 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.030
 have your 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.470
 recovery we give here for example here 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.910
 ready 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 and once you have detected it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.390
 and that here is blue as it looks 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.390
 we are going to start 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 as you can see in the part of here already 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.690
 it restarted the device is a 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.040
 pretty fast procedure 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.040
 and makes surrender 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.400
 although I hear that the drivers are 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.790
 let's wait 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.790
 and ok we can disconnect here 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.860
 I'm going to turn it off 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.900
 what for or what good then we are going to 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.490
 do this very quickly since I think it's 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.100
 the battery is running out of my camera 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.420
 Then I will turn off the device 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.490
 to teach them that the procedure 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.540
 to strike our custom cover and 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.700
 photo completely successful right now and vibrated 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.980
 then we will enter the recovery mode 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.380
 this is by pressing the power button on 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.280
 home button and volume button up to 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.280
 Same time 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.530
 we press once it appears that we leave 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.530
 held down 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.570
 we leave pressed and let go 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.199
 at the end of this , we must appear 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.060
 the coast in excellent recovery there is 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.570
 as you can see it is a custom cover and 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.750
 it's totally different from the stock and 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.460
 well, this one goes with the second 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.900
 part that is the price of rice 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.320
 then here I will give you the pleasure and 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.320
 this one nothing 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.720
 and then see you in the second part
