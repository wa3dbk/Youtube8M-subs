00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860 
this week and luckily we've got another
chance<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.210> right<00:02:22.420> against<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
chance to to put that right against the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.660 
chance to to put that right against the
same<00:02:23.050> team<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.620> we're<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.490> looking

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
same team so we're really looking

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.130 
same team so we're really looking
forward<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.300> trains<00:02:25.660> gone<00:02:25.900> well<00:02:26.110> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
forward to it trains gone well and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.110 
forward to it trains gone well and
hopefully<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> right<00:02:27.790> result

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
hopefully we can get the right result

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.670 
hopefully we can get the right result
yes<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.720> suppose<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.140> were<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.530> that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
yes I suppose if you were to have that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.170 
yes I suppose if you were to have that
loss<00:02:29.860> i<00:02:30.010> guess<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.310> fact<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:31.030> this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
loss i guess the fact that it's at this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.790 
loss i guess the fact that it's at this
back-to-back<00:02:31.600> moment<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.320> Heineken<00:02:32.470> Cup

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
back-to-back moment in the Heineken Cup

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.900 
back-to-back moment in the Heineken Cup
that<00:02:32.950> gives<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> real<00:02:33.370> chance<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.730> put

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that gives you a real chance to put

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.360 
that gives you a real chance to put
those<00:02:34.000> rights<00:02:34.330> wrong<00:02:34.860> yeah<00:02:35.860> definitely<00:02:36.070> it's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
those rights wrong yeah definitely it's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.010 
those rights wrong yeah definitely it's
just<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.940> frustrating<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.600> we<00:02:37.690> didn't<00:02:37.900> put

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
just just frustrating that we didn't put

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.300 
just just frustrating that we didn't put
our<00:02:38.110> game<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.500> pitch<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.100> test

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
our game on the pitch to really test

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.910 
our game on the pitch to really test
them<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:40.150> were<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.570> game<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:41.740> one

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
them and we were in the game at one

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.970 
them and we were in the game at one
point<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.340> then<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.550> let<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> slip<00:02:42.970> again<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
point and then we let it slip again so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.530 
point and then we let it slip again so
yeah<00:02:44.980> we'll<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:45.490> keep<00:02:45.790> working<00:02:46.150> hard<00:02:46.390> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
yeah we'll just keep working hard and
