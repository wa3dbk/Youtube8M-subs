and<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.010> shiny<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> first<00:01:18.030> place<00:01:18.300> will

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
and how shiny is in the first place will

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.190 
and how shiny is in the first place will
depend<00:01:18.870> on<00:01:19.050> how<00:01:19.590> much<00:01:20.040> washing<00:01:20.990> you'll<00:01:21.990> need

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
depend on how much washing you'll need

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to do in order to design it if at all

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.260 
to do in order to design it if at all
because<00:01:24.810> sometimes<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:26.060> washing<00:01:27.060> it
