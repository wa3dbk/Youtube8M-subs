00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 by rebecca from parents child berlin and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.620
 Today I'll show you how to make a beautiful one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.090
 a woman can clap her bags 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 never have enough or she has one 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
 wonderful magnetic closure and there is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.760
 a lot of space 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 You can change the bag in different 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 variants and in different sizes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 doing here is already a large and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 a small fine fabric megamix and that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.670
 you need that for once 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.470
 pattern you can as always 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.700
 download it from me on the dock 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 I will also different sizes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.219
 Just write it with it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 These are some variations 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.800
 then you need leather or 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.079
 imitation leather and a normal 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 Of course you can, too 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.829
 the complete claps only made of leather 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 or just made of cotton and the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 fantasy no limits set 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.610
 You also need this magnet 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 Button is a total glamor button 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 I 've just got them for me 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.699
 Magnetic points are also detected 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 once here in the bag that's how it looks 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.119
 then later and it 's totally easy 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 is that for me sometimes very important 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.299
 Of course, then never brought to hearing 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 in this case just stick and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.020
 a pair of scissors and a measuring tape 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.869
 and the sewing machine I've already got 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 put the cut on leather and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.130
 cut open and also on mine 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.650
 cotton fabric and now it will be easy 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.670
 once folded old right to right 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.670
 the beautiful side and once in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.470
 half finished 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 then put the whole thing in here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.610
 In this case, only the cotton fabric plug 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.470
 because the leather and stick act 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.939
 that is a bit exhausting and it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 was good but not when sewing is allowed 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.759
 no worries just start 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.619
 take a bit slower and then 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.750
 that works fine without it 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.360
 stuck is completely finished 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 simply the fabric here right and left 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.539
 once sewn together 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.310
 the tree building material and also the leather 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.899
 material credit with a normal one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.180
 and I have mine 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 Sewing machine now on 25 employees 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.909
 but could also just see how 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 it with all machines with which 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.880
 you stand out the best experiences 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.799
 then it is very important that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.269
 Of course you will be here again at the beginning 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.110
 and back it goes right 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.180
 is locked and firm and if you are with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.040
 you should sew leather in any case 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 a leather needle so take you the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.810
 normal jersey or no needles 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.989
 and then it can be done 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.989
 start 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 fox back now the other side it is 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.550
 it already finished now she will 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.550
 So just turn around once 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.570
 the corners out I am now 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.430
 inside part if now in jean 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.080
 then of course the needle again 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.080
 Change again to cotton 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 first the whole needles out and then 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.560
 will turn the turn and already 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.870
 times the two bags almost ready now 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.700
 I'll do something, of course, too 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.540
 Just leave it open from the beginning 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.270
 but I can always find it 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.350
 I have become more and more comfortable for a long time 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.660
 Separate the one sometimes a little 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.209
 piece that would be now inside 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.430
 Just cut the seam again 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.110
 that's enough for three good fingers 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.270
 Now I'll show you how to do this 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.070
 Magnet buttons fastened to the leather 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.520
 Although you are working now your gossip 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.470
 as you have it like I want so 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.260
 well, I have her a bit bigger 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.900
 or all day I'll give now 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:55.140
 Just do it then you will work 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:59.700
 the middle of here you can still see one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.300
 a little bit the fine stroke of the middle march 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.799
 you come here but we stopped 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.330
 the button then makes you this part is 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.820
 there are 12 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.200
 one takes the thicker interested 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.440
 just press it once 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.440
 you can already see that here and now 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.940
 fine the two small incisions and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.390
 you cut there with a rose 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:32.640
 heavy in very carefully two holes 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.460
 pure and then the magnet 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.580
 threaded 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.440
 the whole thing turned over there we come 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.449
 out here 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.280
 because the two look outwards 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.630
 worked finished now I'll work again 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.979
 and then only press from inside where else 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.699
 you get out of here in such a stupid 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:58.069
 impression so and now we see already 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:01.550
 right there I have to go I paid there 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.889
 again what other part of it expresses it 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.560
 also purely here you can see the 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:13.070
 both small cuts here 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.509
 is thereby endangered and outward 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.310
 worked finished I have both now 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.250
 turned over that means we see both 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.620
 the beautiful side outside go here 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.669
 with my hands once as far as 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.370
 refer to the bed and dies over 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.530
 The leather bag is beautiful too, nat on seam 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.810
 So with one here 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.680
 These two sewed them together nicely 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.169
 lie 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.880
 and now just around once more rom 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.320
 bag are closed 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.320
 as always front back 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.100
 Of course I have the leather needle now 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.100
 in it 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.330
 you can enter the cards here again 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.330
 a little bit after cutting 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.370
 with we look for the opening and bring 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:12.850
 First, the leather bag out 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.770
 then it just looks like it has to do now 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.690
 still the seam will be closed by 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:29.820
 our server opening just for that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:29.820
 makes fold in fold once edged 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.509
 so it is the mouth nicely put on and 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:46.269
 Now we just have to do that 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.269
 Insert the vaccine here and then 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:55.129
 once to make the bag and ready 

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:57.769
 that our gossip fits quite well 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.419
 to my top or I wish you 

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:02.229
 a lot of fun while imitating 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.229
 next time bye
