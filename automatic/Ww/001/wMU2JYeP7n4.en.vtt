Twitter feeds and I noticed something

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
Twitter feeds and I noticed something
very<00:00:08.490> strange<00:00:09.710> there<00:00:10.710> was<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> post<00:00:12.049> by

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
very strange there was a post by

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259 
very strange there was a post by
gamespot<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.250> maybe<00:00:14.519> even<00:00:14.700> game<00:00:14.969> informer

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
gamespot and maybe even game informer

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.750 
gamespot and maybe even game informer
and<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> basically<00:00:15.900> led<00:00:16.890> me<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.250> website

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and it basically led me to this website

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.720 
and it basically led me to this website
which<00:00:17.940> showed<00:00:18.210> me<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.900> call<00:00:19.230> duty

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
which showed me the call duty

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
which showed me the call duty
specification<00:00:20.730> requirements<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.199> looked

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
specification requirements and I looked

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
specification requirements and I looked
through<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> specification<00:00:23.609> requirements

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
through the specification requirements

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.839 
through the specification requirements
in<00:00:24.359> five<00:00:24.660> seconds<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.410> said<00:00:25.710> bullshit<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
in five seconds I said bullshit this is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.370 
in five seconds I said bullshit this is
not<00:00:27.420> true<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> here's<00:00:30.000> why<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.840> operating

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
not true and here's why the operating

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
not true and here's why the operating
system<00:00:31.740> requires<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> 64-bit<00:00:33.120> Windows<00:00:33.420> 7<00:00:33.660> or

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Windows 8 the cpu is requires the dual

Windows 8 the cpu is requires the dual

core which makes sense we gone to a ram

bytes of ram the maps are just so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
bytes of ram the maps are just so
incredibly<00:00:46.020> small<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.620> process<00:00:47.070> everything

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
incredibly small you process everything

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
incredibly small you process everything
almost<00:00:47.760> instantly<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.260> move<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> the

almost instantly then we move on to the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.459 
almost instantly then we move on to the
hard<00:00:50.100> drive<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.539> requires<00:00:52.020> 50

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

gigabytes<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.949> harddrive<00:00:53.250> space<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.120> don't

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gigabytes of harddrive space you don't

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
gigabytes of harddrive space you don't
need<00:00:54.420> 50<00:00:54.780> gigabytes<00:00:54.949> get<00:00:55.949> 50<00:00:56.340> gigs<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.850> run<00:00:57.030> a

need 50 gigabytes get 50 gigs to run a
call<00:00:57.420> duty<00:00:57.629> game<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> graph<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
call duty game we look at the graph you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
call duty game we look at the graph you
start<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> requires<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> gtx<00:01:00.870> 550<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
start it requires like a gtx 550 or of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
start it requires like a gtx 550 or of
58<00:01:02.609> 70<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> says<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:03.989> even<00:01:04.320> better

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
58 70 and then it says or even better

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.820 
58 70 and then it says or even better
yeah<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.119> don't<00:01:06.479> need<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.080> advance<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
yeah you don't need that advance of a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
yeah you don't need that advance of a
graphics<00:01:08.250> card<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.820> run<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
graphics card to actually run that you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.070 
graphics card to actually run that you
probably<00:01:09.479> only<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> GT<00:01:11.100> 630<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.180> 66

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
probably only need like a GT 630 or 66

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
probably only need like a GT 630 or 66
70<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.860> along<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> lines<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
70 something along the lines of that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
70 something along the lines of that
even<00:01:15.119> lower<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> bet<00:01:16.290> you'd<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.650> able<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> run<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
even lower I bet you'd be able to run a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
even lower I bet you'd be able to run a
game<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.670> 40<00:01:18.600> plus<00:01:19.049> FPS<00:01:19.590> call<00:01:19.920> duty<00:01:20.100> any<00:01:20.430> call

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
game at 40 plus FPS call duty any call

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
game at 40 plus FPS call duty any call
duty<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.360> call<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> old<00:01:21.990> call<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.350> doesn't

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
duty you call do the old call do doesn't

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.280 
duty you call do the old call do doesn't
matter<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.850> course<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.810> still<00:01:25.020> runs

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
matter because of course it still runs

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.280 
matter because of course it still runs
on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.950> same<00:01:26.159> engine<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:28.250> rehash

I'd<00:01:40.680> say<00:01:40.950> 50<00:01:41.400> minutes<00:01:41.700> later<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.509> was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I'd say 50 minutes later there was

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.770 
I'd say 50 minutes later there was
another<00:01:42.720> post<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.710> Twitter<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.909> found<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it basically said Activision came out

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
it basically said Activision came out
and<00:01:48.329> said<00:01:48.450> nope<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.619> true<00:01:50.420> whatever

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420

really confused actually for the
recommended<00:01:58.920> graphics<00:01:59.520> card<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
recommended graphics card the
