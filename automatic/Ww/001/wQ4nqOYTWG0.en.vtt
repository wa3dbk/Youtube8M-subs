00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
days from now for the other operating

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.840 
days from now for the other operating
systems<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.250> running<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.550> windows

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
systems this is running on windows

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.420 
systems this is running on windows
64-bit<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:23.039> thing<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
64-bit so the first thing we're going to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
64-bit so the first thing we're going to
look<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.789> arm<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.609> disposer<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.930> graph

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
look at arm is the disposer the graph

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.089 
look at arm is the disposer the graph
editor<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:29.880> infinite

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
editor as you can see it's now infinite

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
editor as you can see it's now infinite
so<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.700> working<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.090> complex<00:00:33.570> scenes<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so it's working with complex scenes on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
so it's working with complex scenes on
this<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.390> useful<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.430> now

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
this will be very useful for you now

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
have to jam everything into one place

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.010 
have to jam everything into one place
the<00:00:41.790> reasons<00:00:42.090> why<00:00:42.210> they're<00:00:42.390> all<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the reasons why they're all up here is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
the reasons why they're all up here is
because<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.680> working<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.190> other

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because I was working on my other

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
because I was working on my other
monitor<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.969> few<00:00:45.390> days<00:00:45.750> ago<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.559> next

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
monitor a few days ago and the next

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
monitor a few days ago and the next
feature<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.410> lock<00:00:52.410> render<00:00:52.920> now<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
feature is the lock render now is the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
feature is the lock render now is the
you<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.170> able<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.500> lock<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.010> render<00:00:56.370> which
