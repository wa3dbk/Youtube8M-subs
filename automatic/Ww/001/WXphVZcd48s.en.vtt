00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hello everyone, you are on the channel of you 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.390
 those my name is kirill beowulf and today 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.190
 if there was such an opportunity 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.910
 video review I'm dedicated to climate 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.410
 blocking 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.050
 one hundred perine methyl 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 lock octopus which is set 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.150
 but the spacer illuminates completeness 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.349
 blocking well i'll show how it looks 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 differential already installed 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.700
 shipped in a box like this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.000
 he basically came from the transport 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.800
 tape wrapped companies 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 drawing inscription is transport 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280
 of the company 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.039
 Well, how would such a simple 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.100
 the box is sealed with the brand 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 scotch essence inside the box with us 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.839
 so we opened the box inside us 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 cardboard piece holding up which we see 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.729
 direct differential itself 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.289
 open and here you lie here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.979
 differential bunch of small things every 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.049
 fittings 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.000
 By the way, it's very good that manufacturers and 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.780
 puts here enters and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.330
 solenoid valve salt there from 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 he doesnâ€™t need a tour 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.450
 connections that will study in the brain 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 also includes such a plastic 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 protective tube and processed here 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.170
 directly trunk which will 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.350
 give air with small things well here 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.619
 bolts on how much I understand the mount 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.649
 the main couple is not the only one 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 the differential is set as to 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.550
 fittings she's all quality 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:13.050
 salt in general italian italian 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 cult of the company can not say made in 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.099
 italy to italian by the way yes speaking 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.540
 all the accessories work of course well your 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.540
 automatic machine gives protective lubricant 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 also nothing here it goes well enough 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.540
 a lot and i well and the plastic tube itself 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.850
 as I understand, which to serve annually 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.800
 the air is like that 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.970
 set aside well and directly 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.180
 Differential differential itself is heavy 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.350
 on it somewhere here is such a ring 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.270
 through which in principle which 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.239
 acts as a kind of gland 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.050
 through which is fed directly 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.730
 air lock heard that on old 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.250
 on early versions of locking through 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.410
 This ring is very often the rule 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.120
 how much data are you already through 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.010
 I have passed complaints about work already 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.530
 drove some people over twenty 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.010
 thousand kilometers of complaints about work 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.600
 differentials only he started building there 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.739
 there is no lock heavy in front 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:38.329
 nothing ordinary differential 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:44.950
 the spline half axis side it looks 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:49.420
 so here is the little ring I showed you 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.910
 from behind it looks like this 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:58.280
 grease the way to slap camping 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.310
 hands all fat well and who would be like 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.209
 michael of this manufacturer I would 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.450
 recommended at home blocking in any 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.019
 case and latest models with such here 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.480
 ring as I showed 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:18.739
 so because before that a little bit 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.090
 it was different then everything is implemented well yes 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.430
 can actually see me in any 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.680
 I have not come across this case in such 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.200
 designs which is presented here i 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.940
 We recommend that people become extremely 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.910
 only positive reviews 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.180
 regards to the strength of this differential 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.400
 that is what I roll up so on 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.849
 I can't say anything bad either 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.190
 be operated with these wheels 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.200
 exploited with proteins all is well 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.870
 showed itself the only worry 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.630
 need more differential namely fuse 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:01.700
 8 hello semi-axes or mushrooms on bridges on 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:05.570
 military here and so look our 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.620
 the lock is set to the bridge i.e. 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.760
 here it is bolted main pair 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.330
 direct differential itself 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:19.099
 Well, here it is the tube by which 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:22.090
 the air will flow itself lock 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.090
 little ring 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.520
 clamps that attach the differential and 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.370
 hole drilled in the crankcase looks 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.710
 she is like this and here we have a fitting to 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.919
 Unfortunately there is no compressor to 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:48.120
 show how it works on common 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:50.840
 terms in the differential bridge looks like 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.840
 in this way 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:04.059
 all fittings are taken from what went into 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.729
 bundled with nothing blocking 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:09.669
 your did not add a hole 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:13.770
 drilled as written in the instructions we 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:18.369
 see everything inside us looks good and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.389
 on top of it all will cover again 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:22.599
 would like to notice 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.719
 to bomb such a cast iron cat before 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:31.839
 it was usually a metal cap 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:33.759
 bridge acquired just such a cast iron on my 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:38.069
 look at the rear axle and set a 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:40.839
 to make no sense but if a person wants 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:44.860
 then please weigh this flash drive 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:49.119
 well enough and stands on the bridge 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:56.649
 without either alterations that is just take 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:59.319
 and bolted so now that I heard 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:02.499
 that was at one time given a bag of marriage and 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.240
 for only the manufacturer is some kind of ne 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:06.430
 on 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.459
 mug but was someone manufacturer 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.189
 that the casting was poor here 

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:15.479
 here and this part rested the main parkour 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:21.699
 as we see all our shock rises and 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:24.159
 closes do not forget to express emotions 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:27.009
 if you like the video we like if 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.580
 do not like put dizlaik subscribe 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.459
 per channel 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.039
 We join the group in the VKontakte group. 

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:37.409
 your comments ask questions with you 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:37.409
 was your take to new meetings
