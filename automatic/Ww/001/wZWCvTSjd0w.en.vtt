hello and welcome to League of Legends
I'm<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.320> talk<00:00:10.530> about<00:00:10.590> warding<00:00:11.750> not<00:00:12.750> where

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
I'm here to talk about warding not where

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
I'm here to talk about warding not where
to<00:00:13.410> place<00:00:13.650> them<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> place<00:00:14.940> them<00:00:15.269> and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to place them or how to place them and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510 
to place them or how to place them and
whatever<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:16.170> instead<00:00:16.770> talking<00:00:17.250> about

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
whatever but instead talking about

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.570 
whatever but instead talking about
wording<00:00:18.210> over<00:00:18.630> coupled<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> massive<00:00:20.189> walls

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
wording over coupled the massive walls

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.189 
wording over coupled the massive walls
in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.539> game<00:00:22.550> namely<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.269> triangular<00:00:24.900> wall

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in the game namely this triangular wall

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.029 
in the game namely this triangular wall
here<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.369> well<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.420> wall<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.109> course

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
here as well as this wall of course

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
here as well as this wall of course
deals<00:00:29.369> since<00:00:29.970> maps<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.420> mirrored<00:00:31.009> symbols

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
deals since maps are mirrored symbols

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
deals since maps are mirrored symbols
exist<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> other<00:00:33.000> side<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.809> both<00:00:34.230> sides

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
exist on the other side so both sides

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
exist on the other side so both sides
can<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.399> information<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
can use this information this was as you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200 
can use this information this was as you
can<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.629> rather<00:00:40.350> bag<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> ward

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
can see or rather bag but you can ward

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.470 
can see or rather bag but you can ward
right<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.770> even<00:00:44.640> though<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.120> seems

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
right over them even though it seems

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.170 
right over them even though it seems
like<00:00:45.809> impossible<00:00:46.730> there<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.879> couple

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
like impossible there are couple

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
like impossible there are couple
restrictions<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.539> let's<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
restrictions to it so let's go to the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.549 
restrictions to it so let's go to the
midline<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> show<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> am<00:00:55.890> talking<00:00:56.250> about

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
midline and show what I am talking about

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.090 
midline and show what I am talking about
so<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.739> made<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.489> way<00:00:59.730> towards<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> midline

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
so we made out way towards the midline

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
so we made out way towards the midline
sitting<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> brush<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.719> near<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
sitting here in the brush with near this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.340 
sitting here in the brush with near this
very<00:01:05.420> thick<00:01:06.420> walls<00:01:06.990> last<00:01:07.530> obstacle<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.350> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
very thick walls last obstacle and you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.719 
very thick walls last obstacle and you
can<00:01:10.530> word<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.460> over<00:01:12.119> act<00:01:12.950> as<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can word a right over act as you can see

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.870 
can word a right over act as you can see
of<00:01:15.000> course<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> enemy<00:01:17.430> tower

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of course if this was the enemy tower

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
of course if this was the enemy tower
this<00:01:18.630> word<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.439> kinda<00:01:20.130> useless<00:01:20.369> since

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this word would be kinda useless since

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.679 
this word would be kinda useless since
the<00:01:21.330> caller<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.990> provide<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:23.340> wishing<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the caller would provide well wishing to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.740 
the caller would provide well wishing to
it<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.200> enemies<00:01:25.500> could<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.979> killed<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
it so enemies could just killed off and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
it so enemies could just killed off and
this<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.770> useful<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.400> well

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
this probably not so useful as well

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
this probably not so useful as well
however<00:01:30.710> being<00:01:31.710> able<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> work<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.490> brush

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
however being able to work the brush

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.770 
however being able to work the brush
from<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:36.240> cases<00:01:36.299> from

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
from this side or in some cases from

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
from this side or in some cases from
this<00:01:37.049> side<00:01:37.350> even<00:01:37.820> will<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:39.680> useful<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.920> some

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this side even will be useful at some

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.569 
this side even will be useful at some
point<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.360> another<00:01:42.740> let's<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> our<00:01:44.250> top

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
point or another let's go to our top

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.539 
point or another let's go to our top
line<00:01:45.530> we're<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:47.689> near<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.189> massive<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
line we're here near this massive the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
line we're here near this massive the
wall<00:01:52.970> with<00:01:53.970> some<00:01:54.299> wording<00:01:54.689> business<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
wall with some wording business so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
wall with some wording business so
basically<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.060> word<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.469> side

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
basically you can word to the other side

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.810 
basically you can word to the other side
of<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.430> for<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.710> bottom<00:02:01.710> bed<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> work

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
of it or for the bottom bed you can work

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.429 
of it or for the bottom bed you can work
the<00:02:02.850> top<00:02:03.659> side<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.820> same<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:07.079> ward

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the top side of it same way you can ward

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.229 
the top side of it same way you can ward
a<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:08.009> over<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> bra

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
a right over it into the bra

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.270 
a right over it into the bra
just<00:02:12.239> fine<00:02:12.769> however<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:16.260> from<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> brush

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
just fine however here from the brush

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.830 
just fine however here from the brush
side<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.659> not<00:02:18.930> been<00:02:19.200> able<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.709> find<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.840> way

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
side I have not been able to find a way

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.250 
side I have not been able to find a way
to<00:02:22.709> board<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.400> location<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.390> did<00:02:24.750> this

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
to board this location I did this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.130 
to board this location I did this
morning<00:02:25.560> from<00:02:26.069> every<00:02:27.060> time<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.510> drop<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> word

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
morning from every time you drop a word

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.369 
morning from every time you drop a word
it<00:02:28.590> ends<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.780> maybe<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> good

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
it ends up there maybe that is a good

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.649 
it ends up there maybe that is a good
thing<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:31.769> there<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.879> outside<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
thing because there it is outside of the

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.420 
thing because there it is outside of the
vision<00:02:33.959> range<00:02:34.349> provided<00:02:34.950> by<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:35.190> power<00:02:36.379> so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
vision range provided by this power so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
vision range provided by this power so
it<00:02:38.430> cannot<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.909> destroyed<00:02:39.360> by<00:02:39.750> simply<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
it cannot be destroyed by simply this

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.300 
it cannot be destroyed by simply this
power<00:02:41.040> providing<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.450> vision<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.859> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
power providing the vision to it and you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.530 
power providing the vision to it and you
can<00:02:44.609> still<00:02:45.209> put<00:02:45.890> wrong<00:02:46.890> location<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.359> can

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
can still put wrong location you can

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.680
