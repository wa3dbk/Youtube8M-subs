allows us to build 3d houses really fast
let's<00:00:12.030> see<00:00:12.179> how<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.330> Tool<00:00:12.570> Works<00:00:13.400> by<00:00:14.400> default

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
let's see how the Tool Works by default

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
let's see how the Tool Works by default
the<00:00:15.330> preset<00:00:15.719> comes<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> rectangular

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the preset comes with a rectangular

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.609 
the preset comes with a rectangular
shape<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> course<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.869> use<00:00:19.080> our<00:00:19.590> own

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
shape but of course we can use our own

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.179 
shape but of course we can use our own
shape<00:00:20.720> all<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.080> need<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.410> after<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
shape all we need to do after that is to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.340 
shape all we need to do after that is to
just<00:00:23.850> drag<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.539> shape<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> house

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
just drag the shape into the house

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
just drag the shape into the house
builder<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.019> our<00:00:28.199> basic

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
builder now now that we have our basic

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
builder now now that we have our basic
shape<00:00:28.560> ready<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.789> start<00:00:30.029> building<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
shape ready we can start building the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620 
shape ready we can start building the
rooms<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:31.610> we're<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.820> satisfied<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
rooms if we're not satisfied with the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
rooms if we're not satisfied with the
shape<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.649> move<00:00:34.860> around<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.340> points

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
shape we can just move around the points

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.560 
shape we can just move around the points
to<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> desired<00:00:36.570> result<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> points

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to get the desired result if the points

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930 
to get the desired result if the points
are<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.780> visible<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.829> enable<00:00:41.040> x-ray<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
are not visible we can enable x-ray and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
are not visible we can enable x-ray and
now<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> clear<00:00:43.440> picture<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.070> base

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
now we have a clear picture of the base

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.360 
now we have a clear picture of the base
shape<00:00:45.350> alternatively<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> switch

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
shape alternatively we can switch

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
shape alternatively we can switch
between<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.969> mesh<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> blueprint<00:00:49.020> mode<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
between the mesh and blueprint mode and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.560 
between the mesh and blueprint mode and
when<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:50.370> done<00:00:50.550> re-enable<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> walls

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
when we're done re-enable the walls

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
when we're done re-enable the walls
there<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:54.840> snapping<00:00:55.469> options

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there are also snapping options

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:08.190 
there are also snapping options
available<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.539> help<00:00:57.539> us<00:00:57.660> align<00:00:57.989> our<00:00:58.230> points

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200 

now<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.500> basic<00:01:09.890> shape<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.280> finalized<00:01:10.729> we

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
now that a basic shape is finalized we

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.609 
now that a basic shape is finalized we
can<00:01:11.360> start<00:01:11.570> building<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.049> walls<00:01:12.080> for<00:01:12.530> our

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.790 

we<00:02:09.040> have<00:02:09.250> several<00:02:09.729> ways<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:11.590> way

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
we have several ways to do that one way

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.830 
we have several ways to do that one way
is<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.130> create<00:02:12.550> materials<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> assign<00:02:13.660> them

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is to create materials and assign them

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.830 
is to create materials and assign them
to<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> specific<00:02:14.230> null<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> let's<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.570> how<00:02:16.690> this

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to a specific null so let's see how this

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.980 
to a specific null so let's see how this
works<00:02:17.110> let's<00:02:17.400> create<00:02:18.400> two<00:02:18.610> materials<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.330> for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
works let's create two materials one for

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.630 
works let's create two materials one for
the<00:02:20.080> floor<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.160> wall

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210 

now<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> materials<00:02:27.530> ready<00:02:27.710> we

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
now that we have the materials ready we

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.330 
now that we have the materials ready we
just<00:02:28.460> drag<00:02:28.820> them<00:02:29.030> into<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.450> right<00:02:29.600> room<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
just drag them into the right room and

most on top of these options we have

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.340 
most on top of these options we have
another<00:04:10.930> option<00:04:11.170> for<00:04:11.560> floor<00:04:12.100> molding<00:04:13.170> we<00:04:14.170> can

to<00:04:22.690> concentrate<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> specific<00:04:23.530> room<00:04:24.010> we<00:04:24.640> can

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
to concentrate on a specific room we can

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.689

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.099 

now<00:04:33.699> that<00:04:33.909> we<00:04:34.059> know<00:04:34.209> how<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.449> tool<00:04:34.809> works

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:35.109 
now that we know how the tool works

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:36.839 
now that we know how the tool works
let's<00:04:35.799> play<00:04:36.039> around<00:04:36.309> with<00:04:36.549> a<00:04:36.609> more

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
let's play around with a more

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.679 
let's play around with a more
traditional<00:04:36.879> house<00:04:37.719> shape<00:04:39.239> we<00:04:40.239> start<00:04:40.509> by<00:04:40.659> just

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
traditional house shape we start by just

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.979 
traditional house shape we start by just
loading<00:04:41.289> up<00:04:41.409> a<00:04:41.499> float<00:04:41.709> plan<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.159> the<00:04:42.279> top<00:04:42.459> view

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:42.989 
loading up a float plan on the top view

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.539 
loading up a float plan on the top view
we<00:04:43.989> quickly<00:04:44.289> trace<00:04:44.829> the<00:04:44.979> shape<00:04:45.009> with<00:04:45.459> the

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:45.549 
we quickly trace the shape with the

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:48.389 
we quickly trace the shape with the
polygon<00:04:45.969> pen<00:04:46.179> and<00:04:46.389> then<00:04:47.079> refine<00:04:47.829> the<00:04:47.979> shape<00:04:48.189> by

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:48.399 
polygon pen and then refine the shape by

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:57.840 
polygon pen and then refine the shape by
aligning<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.879> points

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.480 

now<00:04:58.480> with<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.230> knife<00:04:59.440> tool<00:04:59.710> we<00:05:00.010> start<00:05:00.310> adding

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
now with the knife tool we start adding

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.760 
now with the knife tool we start adding
our<00:05:00.850> walls<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.270> deleting<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.110> ones<00:05:02.320> we<00:05:02.530> don't

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
our walls and deleting the ones we don't

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.170 
our walls and deleting the ones we don't
need

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.880 

by<00:05:09.180> just<00:05:09.450> adding<00:05:09.660> splines<00:05:10.170> we<00:05:10.560> can<00:05:10.710> quickly

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
by just adding splines we can quickly

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.970 
by just adding splines we can quickly
