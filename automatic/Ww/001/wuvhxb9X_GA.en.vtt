00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the world gets erased and then there's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
the world gets erased and then there's

on or off I like to leave it on because

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.679 
on or off I like to leave it on because
villages<00:01:16.259> usually<00:01:16.680> give<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:18.390> stuff

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

and dungeons you need them if you want
to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> finish<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> world

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
to go to the end and finish the world

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.080 
to go to the end and finish the world
electrification<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> seed<00:01:26.220> couldn't<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
electrification and the seed couldn't be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.890 
electrification and the seed couldn't be
anything<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> Eve<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> world<00:01:30.509> type<00:01:30.720> on

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
anything you and Eve the world type on

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
anything you and Eve the world type on
default<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> put<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.460> super<00:01:32.820> flat

default because if you put on super flat

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.069 
default because if you put on super flat
she's<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.259> no<00:01:34.439> trees<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.840> no<00:01:36.840> food
