it may have a BT 30 spindle but that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.290 
it may have a BT 30 spindle but that
really<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> compromise<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.180> way

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
really is it the compromise with the way

through<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.769> brother<00:02:52.980> control<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.879> may<00:02:54.090> need

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
through the brother control you may need

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.330 
through the brother control you may need
to<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> few<00:02:55.019> modifications<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:55.890> they're

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to make a few modifications but they're

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.830 
to make a few modifications but they're
very<00:02:56.489> minor<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.540> fact<00:02:57.720> those

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
very minor and in fact those

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.589 
very minor and in fact those
modifications<00:02:58.650> are<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.459> some<00:02:59.790> ways<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.359> aid

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
modifications are in some ways to aid

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.660 
modifications are in some ways to aid
the<00:03:00.840> production<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> speed<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.459> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the production and the speed of the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.970 
the production and the speed of the
machining<00:03:03.090> process<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> move<00:03:04.709> around<00:03:04.799> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
machining process so I move around to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
machining process so I move around to
the<00:03:05.099> side<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.519> machine<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.599> look

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the side of the machine and as we look

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.860 
the side of the machine and as we look
inside<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.739> see<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.780> where<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
inside we can see here the where the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.050 
inside we can see here the where the
machining<00:03:10.260> process<00:03:10.290> takes<00:03:10.920> place<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.909> is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
machining process takes place so this is

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.690 
machining process takes place so this is
the<00:03:12.829> second<00:03:13.829> pallet<00:03:14.069> which<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.340> inside<00:03:14.639> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the second pallet which is inside the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.470 
the second pallet which is inside the
machine<00:03:15.120> we've<00:03:15.840> got<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.459> past<00:03:17.459> base<00:03:17.730> where<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
machine we've got a past base where the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.420 
machine we've got a past base where the
coolant<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.200> chips<00:03:19.769> will<00:03:19.950> flood<00:03:20.190> away

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
coolant and the chips will flood away

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
coolant and the chips will flood away
and<00:03:20.730> they'll<00:03:21.060> they'll<00:03:21.420> gravitate<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.199 
and they'll they'll gravitate to the
back<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.859> machine<00:03:23.159> or<00:03:23.639> rear<00:03:23.909> of<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
back of the machine or rear of the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.890 
back of the machine or rear of the
machine<00:03:24.889> moving<00:03:25.889> up<00:03:26.129> then<00:03:26.480> we<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.659> see<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
machine moving up then we can see the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.429 
machine moving up then we can see the
tool<00:03:28.109> changer<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.849> see<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:31.170> spindle

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
tool changer and we can see the spindle

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.649 
tool changer and we can see the spindle
nose<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.579> is<00:03:32.730> obviously<00:03:33.120> where<00:03:33.599> the

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
nose and this is obviously where the

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.260 
nose and this is obviously where the
tool<00:03:34.290> change

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
tool change

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.680 
tool change
mechanism<00:03:36.230> takes<00:03:36.410> place<00:03:36.790> now<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.300> table

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
mechanism takes place now the table

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.780 
mechanism takes place now the table
itself<00:03:39.020> can<00:03:39.290> actually<00:03:39.440> take<00:03:39.860> up<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.070> 200

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.230 
itself can actually take up to 200
kilograms<00:03:41.210> in<00:03:41.390> weight<00:03:41.440> again<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.620> that's

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
kilograms in weight again so that's

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.040 
kilograms in weight again so that's
demonstrating<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.360> fact<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.780> machine

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
demonstrating the fact that the machine

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.290 
demonstrating the fact that the machine
isn't<00:03:45.170> just<00:03:45.650> for<00:03:46.010> lightweight<00:03:46.820> components

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300
