 I would like you to sing 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.450
 and we'll have to wait until nightfall because 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.580
 is when these birds sing many 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.930
 creatures sing in the night when 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.060
 it starts to get dark 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.210
 it is the ideal time for these creatures 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.280
 the owls start talking about the 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.770
 raccoons to refuse 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.020
 if some creatures sing all the 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.100
 night and they know when they start at 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.320
 to become night 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.570
 at dusk you can not wait while 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.280
 punish without unleashing then we will have 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.740
 than to devise something except you have to 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.400
 listen to it sing deliciously 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.230
 you will love yourself and sometimes sing for 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.530
 warn your teammates of some 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.530
 danger 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.890
