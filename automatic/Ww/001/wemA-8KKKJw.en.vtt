00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.970
 you have understood that it is in the third 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.070
 account and it will be 32 people worth 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.360
 is that they are going to be filled 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.850
 the squares very fast 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.420
 they pointed if you want to play simply 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.630
 ok and kids, things will be very 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.149
 simple the host erales guerri that has 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.880
 100 megs and yes when I play the cost 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.830
 I 'll do that I also have 100 megabytes and if 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.570
 Guerrini them touches us against Me 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.429
 that I know of pure coincidence because 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.440
 costing another person worth I know that 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.269
 many many of you maybe not 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.830
 you can that day and such but to see that no 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.830
 nothing happens, surely if this comes out 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 well then it will repeat again 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.360
 make another tournament so do not miss 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.370
 worry and nothing kids is simple that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.500
 get to the final because the final also 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.410
 obviously goes up and then the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600
 winner 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.270
 If you have a channel, I'll leave the description 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.450

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.070
 piece of paper and I'm going to take them and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.900

 the nice blades are deactivated that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.220
 that's the most important thing there is camera 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.020
 death not only the most active 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.170
 will be those who have had more luck 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.010
 watch the video before and places will be left 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.190
 that I will catch 32 people good already and as 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.430
 a lot of places occupied and maybe with 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.730
 xerez to three people in plan of yes in 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.190

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 another person that I will have taken it and the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.690
