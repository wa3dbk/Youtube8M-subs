00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.920
 know obliged to take it theater of 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.519
 white coats do not have to question 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.580
 the three small dots 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.289
 it's too small point yes I 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.429
 knew to break into science in this 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.679
 which goes through my head when I say 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.100
 maybe white coats actually 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.730
 three small dots 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.320
 white theater coats actually 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.290
 it's a name of my life if one year even 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.520
 pascal or three small dots I was a 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.250
 little bit alone that is to say there 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.400
 had me on stage and is the stage manager 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.739
 next door that was nice it's a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.800
 great memory no loneliness 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.230
 three small dots here but I have 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.050
 everything learned there actually 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.909
 finally, I'm happy if there's more 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.249
 of people at the stadium 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.050
 so abbas also knew millions a 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.789
 little lawyer with me writing I 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.550
 may have been a bit too ambitious on 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.679
 this coup d'office 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.239
 well yeah committed office is true 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.499
 during by a young lawyer during 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.659
 seven years not committed automatically during 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:02.539
 this environment but before age 87 and 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.640
 I love this dress and the character 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.560
 looks a little like me it's a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.299
 agent in the dress I loved commission 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.810
 ex-officio and that vouchers 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.240
 memories 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.040
 strange but 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.640
 is really nice the commission 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.920
 of office meet people of people 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.820
 weird that's it but it's really 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.430
 really good source of inspiration and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.470
 well inspirational cf the map 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.289
 previous in fact she is commission 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.210
 ex-officio my life before and the idea of 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.130
 change since in fact I passed 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.820
 from one universe to another 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.250
 and here is essama I wrote based on that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.450
 and after the changes including by 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.159
 example employment pole because when we 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.630
 becomes a suitable artist 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 intermittent it is necessary to go through pole 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.369
 employment 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.440
 and that's very very funny r 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.670
 trick questions here are the three cards 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.119
 in the trap so I do not know which 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.250
 to choose 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.549
 caroline vigneaux not necessarily it's done 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:03.429
 a little in the jimmy choo good will me 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.170
 the money what the money in the singer 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.310
 but is now trying to show the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.989
 notion that I do not actually get to win 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.320
 very well my life before and then when 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.940
 I changed my life I knew a little 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.920
 anticipated the fact that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.270
 that I will earn more money and it was 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.410
 beautiful it was anticipated but it's true 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.300
 that I had not anticipated that I would win 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.910
 more money at that point the artist is 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.870
 feeds on applause and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.190
 laughs of women's theater 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 the little mice that's cute 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.720
 smiles the cities on the fields where that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.010
 because it's city or countryside 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.350
 but wait guys horses come 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.760
 to me it's the campaign it's not 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.110
 ghrelin no it's true that I like 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.870
 the countryside but I live in the city 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.490
 so I actually witness 50 50 the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 city ​​for all that is positive the 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.630
 campaign tote all he is a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.400
 awesome 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.800
 pardon is a junk so that's 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.640
 sauce like inspiration it's for me 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.740
 it's my mythical 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.620
 I even get on the internet 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.120
 say during the text of the play of 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.500
 theater and I had written a play 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 and for that I was still a lawyer 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.820
 and I had already copied and pasted 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 to know even the number 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.340
 of pages needed to have the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.600
 size is a piece it's thanks to them 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.180
 and then I know them all 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.010
 replicas by heart I know that's it 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.450
 it's mythical what one day I 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.290
 will say it changes the cross it was 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.730

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.230
 nantes worked the garden have of course 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.239
 do why nantes 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.860
 I do not know maybe because I 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.870
 I was born there in fact it's an accident 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.450
 I'm from Nantes on my identity card 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.890
