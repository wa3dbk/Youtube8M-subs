 the next game day is the second 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.960
 dynamo we get 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 here in the tournament just beautiful 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.889
 atmosphere atmosphere of friendliness 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.420
 all such family percentage hikes on 

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:01.039
 matches are very popular and we 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.959
 nice to play in this setting 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.259
 but as for sports 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.499
 component asks 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.539
 Aleksandrovna something without say that we 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.280
 of course we will try to fight for the main 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.119
 prize 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.459
 but we understand that the class is much 

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.409
 yielding to many rivals and most importantly 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.310
 our trumps are few players 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.909
 German national team experienced goalkeeper Jamie 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.509
 leads and score shook that's probably all in 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.509
 the first match the Germans fought the Czech Republic 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.149
 club Karlovy Vary and finalist ooo past 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.959
 extra season leagues this season 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.340
 favor is not so successful on the fifth 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.319
 place in the standings but not 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.499
 leaves the belts of the 4th winning medal and 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:37.799
 hit into which 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.299
 and here's a romance alesha the queen must be declared 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.389
 the german club for this tournament talks about 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.979
 tom that 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.280
 I shouldn't have probably played if 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.009
 I would not have been invited to German 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.450
 team but well so i am very happy to have a dip in 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 the atmosphere of this unforgettable 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.630
 tournament alexander asks 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.429

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.430
 what the novel said but I'm a professional and 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 I will certainly try my team 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 the Germans were seriously preparing this battle 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 against the word Czechs but frankly 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.199
 nothing 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.719
 good from this did not work with the score 5 2 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.589
 Looking ahead, Iâ€™ll say that the Czechs won 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.009
 they distinguished Michael good for 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.059

 only in the championship of switzerland but also in the league 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.609
 champions but generally as ryan tells me 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.379
 very interesting to follow then how 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.179
 Canadians are inferior Swiss clubs 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.479
 the percentage is struggling with the Swiss 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.229
 team power and turned out 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.009
 terrific evaluation you have 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.719
 Canadians played and urine flowed into the series 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.949
