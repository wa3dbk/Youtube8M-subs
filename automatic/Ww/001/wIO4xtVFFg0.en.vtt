00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
think Mohammed will actually do

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.180 
think Mohammed will actually do
something<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.050> already<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.379> my<00:02:14.410> full<00:02:14.709> roster

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
something I already have my full roster

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.069 
something I already have my full roster
of<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.459> actually<00:02:15.700> need<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.900> would<00:02:17.019> have

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
had this Ross in the first season I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.510

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.469 
something I'll notice about lebron james
as<00:05:56.409> well<00:05:56.590> as<00:05:56.770> in<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.099> fourth<00:05:57.340> quarter<00:05:57.520> if<00:05:57.880> the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
as well as in the fourth quarter if the

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.330 
as well as in the fourth quarter if the
game<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:58.960> just<00:05:59.080> like<00:05:59.260> a<00:05:59.289> regular<00:05:59.590> season<00:06:00.070> game

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
game is just like a regular season game

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.850 
game is just like a regular season game
he'll<00:06:01.000> choke<00:06:01.270> in<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.599> fourth<00:06:01.870> quarter<00:06:02.169> but<00:06:02.770> if

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
he'll choke in the fourth quarter but if

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.120 
he'll choke in the fourth quarter but if
it's<00:06:03.070> like<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.400> Down<00:06:03.789> playoff<00:06:04.780> game<00:06:05.139> got<00:06:05.740> a<00:06:05.770> win

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
it's like a Down playoff game got a win

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.300 
it's like a Down playoff game got a win
he<00:06:06.880> is<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.240> best<00:06:07.539> player<00:06:07.900> in<00:06:08.289> the<00:06:08.380> fourth<00:06:09.070> ball

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
he is the best player in the fourth ball

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.860 
he is the best player in the fourth ball
fourth<00:06:09.820> quarter<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.150> get<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.360> ball<00:06:10.510> to<00:06:10.720> other

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
fourth quarter to get the ball to other

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.770 
fourth quarter to get the ball to other
than<00:06:11.050> Chauncey<00:06:11.470> Billups<00:06:12.300> he's<00:06:13.300> he's<00:06:13.659> an

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
than Chauncey Billups he's he's an

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.390 
than Chauncey Billups he's he's an
amazing<00:06:14.169> player<00:06:14.620> in<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.919> fourth<00:06:15.190> quarter

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
amazing player in the fourth quarter

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.520 
amazing player in the fourth quarter
like<00:06:15.699> he<00:06:16.300> only<00:06:16.690> gets<00:06:16.840> his<00:06:17.050> points<00:06:17.349> in<00:06:17.440> the

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
like he only gets his points in the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.740 
like he only gets his points in the
fourth<00:06:17.770> quarter<00:06:17.979> if<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.340> makes<00:06:18.669> sense<00:06:18.909> in

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
fourth quarter if that makes sense in

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.730 
fourth quarter if that makes sense in
the<00:06:19.900> fourth<00:06:20.139> quarter<00:06:20.289> he<00:06:20.610> unloads<00:06:21.610> on<00:06:21.970> teams

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
the fourth quarter he unloads on teams
