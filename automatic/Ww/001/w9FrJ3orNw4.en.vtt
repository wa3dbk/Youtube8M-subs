00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello, let's talk about books 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.060
 which I read in March on my 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 queues of 8 books well, and there are a lot of many 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.730
 separate video so i hope that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.889
 very long today's video will not be 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.949
 because I lay on top of it than 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.130
 I shot my last video this series 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.140
 Emelya Bravo which turns French 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.109
 all the same 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.529
 and two books as strong 90 weasel 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.080
 needles and 7 dwarfs and the prince but the beach you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 so small 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 it seems to be something like that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.489
 children's unobtrusive and I like not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.379
 it seemed funny to the child too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 I highly recommend these things. 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.340
 about the next two books, too, was 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.700
 separate video in which both 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.329
 this red moon aida flint was mentioned 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.280
 which I thought was a mixture 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 the twilight atmosphere is not exactly the plot and on 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 atmosphere and yeast masters by the word 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 such a pretty tough short 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.010
 it was very similar 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 stories need for fairy tales little red hat 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.850
 and this is a bear on the modern way 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.000
 with elements of a detective story and of course 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 we have a killer here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 this one and waiting for you jennifer armen count 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.170
 which really embarrassed me and the second 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 I just had half the book 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.220
 rusty so dont know if you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.520
 interesting more about it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.580
 this is such a melodrama very, very 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.250
 tearful dramatic past i'm not 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.560
 I can do it and so on about young 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 people who study at university and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 himself interesting detail and opinion all 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
 links to individual reviews will be in 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.790
 description and detail stop 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.860
 something to me whether I want to continue this 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.550
 lord of the rings first guardian volume 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.620
 john ronald ruell rings tolkien them 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.200
 if you said the initials correctly 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.990
 these books we dedicated the most 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.500
 time will change the whole two hours and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.540
 there will be more videos on the topic because we 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 all promise to make a fake movie in 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.810
 Tolkien and broadcast are on this 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.300
 about this month i am very happy 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.060
 At first I was afraid to read because 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.950
 the book is not really a small one 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.590
 more than all three volumes they make up 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.959
 the very essence of themselves are 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.390
 Essentially, one book is divided into 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.610
 three volumes are already the merit of the publishers 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.830
 so here I have achieved a little bit 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 grapheman download tolkien she 's still 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.000
 there is something in him that he loves 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.220
 milk and write about anything 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.370
 she was a little embarrassed before reading 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.480
 when I read from him and the hobbit and the rufer 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 new something i was afraid of and partially 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.250
 my fears came true because 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.739
 it was partially transfused from empty to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.880
 empty for stew adventures with another 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.970
 parties and I think the last 400 pages 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.370
 medalist analysts know it easily 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.260
 adventure as they are this is the book 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.190
 which must be read before 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 in general, in principle 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.970
 understand begins to understand what is 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.430
 fantasy genre 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.650
 the story that we all know that we are 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.800
 all love that did not require retelling 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.770
 a story about a police named frodo how 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.950
 sets off to look for the adventures of the moment 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.260
 all the same hard dangerous way to 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 destroy the ring that handed to him 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.130
 gave it 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.500
 because of Hamid we all know it too 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.750
 water is not worth even retelling the plot 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.760
 because everything is so obvious I 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.490
 so everyone knows and loves him but here 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.510
 before the book 1 angel after the movie like i don't 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.000
 many reach 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.480
 I want to say do not be afraid there is nothing 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.300
 scary, she's a more children's book than me 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.370
 expected turned out to say that hobbiton 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.140
 more childish augustine end is already more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.890
 for adults it seemed to me a face and 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 cartoons 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.270
 children's works plans for him 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.190
 they need to be read to a child and that 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.070
 plan that they can start when you still 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.810
 about ten years later the book was also 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.770
 perfect discussion is red hill 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.740
 Jamie McGwire 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.070
 zombie apocalypse we have several heroes 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.380
 who go to the same place there 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.959
 they meet and there does not occur 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.390
 some kind of relationship and some of them 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.660
 dies from them a lot of very remains 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.530
 You know such a move Olya blockbuster me 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.460
 it seems exactly in terms of the game as if 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.500
 would it be a movie 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.040
 interesting sounds interesting all this 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.250
 but it looked like a book of me 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.830
 embarrassed a little bit because we'll see 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.760
 action films yes on the screen also fluff hike 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.669
 Rolled these killed I do not know what happened 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.950
 a book that looks like the truth at 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.020
 As such, I have not had become 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.419
 maybe this whole martial fiction 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.360
 which man writes too many things 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.850
 This contains but not much 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.580
 understood a little 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.610
 less probably a funny story for those 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.340
 who likes to read about the zombie apocalypse and 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.780
 how everything died from and the last book 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.530
 which was actually read 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.650
 me 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.700
 the first batch is a folk teacher 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.030
 I am Ukraine 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.860
 This story you know who waits for a long time 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.510
 cola something will happen at which 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.880
 nothing happens very much 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.610
 quiet story about a young man 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.620
 who as someone noticed absolutely 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.720
 replica Jenner just men 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.880
 guise and here i can so it 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.710
 really true that young man 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.080
 which protagonist you so much 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.640
 similar to a woman in some way 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.650
 manners 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.680
 he has to calculate it all 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.860
 worries that really wants to compare 10 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.400
 years gin and he gets a job 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.169
 to the teacher of belgium he comes he runs away 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.880
 from everything out there at his home in the family 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.520
 his problems no one likes give myself up 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.740
 abandoned so on so young 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.010
 the teacher comes to study with him 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.200
 English in my language they have a satchel 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.330
 This year, two of my all 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.580
 perceived know as a pupil teacher 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.560
 there can not communicate and all that and now 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.050
 this whole book is probably in essence 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.180
 experiencing our main character tom 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.340
 which meant under dislikes here then not 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.910
 loves there then and subjected to a woman here 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.500
 then so the woman therefore apart from this 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.850
 quite interesting in Ulagan 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.190
 plan that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.240
 jenner we are not really liked me 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.160
 I guess I really do not remember why 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.080
 help seemed too easy 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.060
 it is written not to even reconsider 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.440
 It seems to me that the video where he spoke about 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.110
 janet why 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.360
 I didn’t have to like with teachers 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.520
 there was nothing to me like that 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.400
 annoyed or so much 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.230
 Well, very calm 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.110
 story if you like with him such 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.540
 classic and quiet works then 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.330
 I can advise folded well 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.300
 Today it is all links to all books on 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.480
 which were shot a separate video in 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.160
 description and write of course that you 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.650
