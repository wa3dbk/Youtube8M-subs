00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.390
 here you only have to hit the bike empin 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 So I made some good water. 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.850
 now it's time that I've been so 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.019
 fast as I went straight through 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.230
 checkpoint I believe that the card is 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.040
 here but I could not finish it 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.870
 I was on the bike without professionalization. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.880
 come on speeding here we come 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.040

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.019

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.050
 races there every day I record race 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.909
 people ask the time but the time 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.159

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.560

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.389

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.810
 later in the day, usually in the 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.570
 late in the morning in the morning is more difficult is 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.139

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.150
 Only now I can not go through a 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:01.100

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.170
 a schedule but I have already seen who are light here 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.400
 in the afternoon and then you can 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.890

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.540

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.190

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.840
 to the point of not reaching the 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.550
 half the situation 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.780

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.650
 try to take the ramp in the opposite direction 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.810
 the approval of the goodness of advice is not 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.650
 On the straight here at least I fell in 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.990
