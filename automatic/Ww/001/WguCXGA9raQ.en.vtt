where where we're at to know where we're

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
a lot with letting us know whether

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.410 
a lot with letting us know whether
students<00:00:58.640> are<00:00:58.760> fully<00:00:59.000> getting<00:00:59.330> the

students are fully getting the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.869 
students are fully getting the
information<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.140> helps<00:01:00.350> us<00:01:00.519> guide<00:01:01.519> our

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
information and helps us guide our

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:02.829 
information and helps us guide our
instruction<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:02.570> what<00:01:02.660> type<00:01:02.809> of

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
instruction and what type of

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.600 
instruction and what type of
modifications<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:03.710> might<00:01:03.890> need<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.129> do<00:01:04.309> we

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
modifications we might need to do we

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.880 
modifications we might need to do we
like<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.059> as<00:01:05.360> students<00:01:05.930> because<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.680> tells

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
like that as students because it tells

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.010 
like that as students because it tells
you<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:07.340> how<00:01:07.820> good<00:01:08.090> you're<00:01:08.240> doing<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
you like how good you're doing and you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.139 
you like how good you're doing and you
can<00:01:09.200> see<00:01:09.440> it's<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.280> same<00:01:10.490> information<00:01:10.820> but

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
can see it's the same information but

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.820 
can see it's the same information but
the<00:01:11.600> skills<00:01:12.259> were<00:01:12.410> learning<00:01:12.740> about

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the skills were learning about

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.130 
the skills were learning about
presentation<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.030> things<00:01:14.509> like<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:14.720> it's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
presentation and things like that it's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.230 
presentation and things like that it's
really<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.160> see<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.580> change<00:01:16.850> are<00:01:17.119> they

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
really you can see the change are they

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.730 
really you can see the change are they
using<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.660> language<00:01:17.810> effectively<00:01:18.259> to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
using the language effectively to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.440 
using the language effectively to
communicate<00:01:19.220> what<00:01:19.369> they<00:01:19.460> know<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.820> then<00:01:20.090> to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
communicate what they know and then to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.480 
communicate what they know and then to
do<00:01:21.080> they<00:01:21.200> actually<00:01:21.410> understand<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> content

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
do they actually understand the content

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.650 
do they actually understand the content
i<00:01:22.610> believe<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.060> they<00:01:23.180> study<00:01:23.450> the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
i believe that they study the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.350 
i believe that they study the
information<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.500> they<00:01:24.590> see<00:01:24.649> what<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.759> state

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
information and they see what the state

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.340 
information and they see what the state
their<00:01:26.509> students<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.840> know<00:01:27.050> what<00:01:27.200> they're

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
their students to know what they're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.290 
their students to know what they're
learning<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:28.039> allows<00:01:28.340> them<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.670> make<00:01:29.030> some

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
learning this allows them to make some

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.930 
learning this allows them to make some
changes<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:30.440> improve<00:01:30.920> upon<00:01:31.429> what<00:01:31.759> they've

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
changes to improve upon what they've

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.359 
changes to improve upon what they've
already<00:01:32.149> started<00:01:32.539> or<00:01:32.960> maybe<00:01:33.320> even<00:01:33.410> rethink<00:01:34.160> or

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
already started or maybe even rethink or

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.880 
already started or maybe even rethink or
restart<00:01:35.000> we<00:01:35.450> try<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> meet<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.560> students

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
restart we try to meet the students

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.800 
restart we try to meet the students
where<00:01:37.070> they<00:01:37.100> are<00:01:37.520> realizing<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.600> have<00:01:38.780> a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
where they are realizing that we have a

where they are realizing that we have a
limited<00:01:39.200> amount<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.530> time<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:40.369> think

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
limited amount of time and I just think

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.279 
limited amount of time and I just think
discussing<00:01:41.360> things<00:01:41.509> with<00:01:41.660> them<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:42.170> you

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
discussing things with them and if you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.260 
discussing things with them and if you
see<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.800> puzzled<00:01:43.160> look<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.399> their<00:01:43.580> face<00:01:43.759> you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
see that puzzled look on their face you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.330 
see that puzzled look on their face you
need<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.599> stop<00:01:44.990> whatever<00:01:45.319> you're<00:01:45.679> doing<00:01:45.740> and
