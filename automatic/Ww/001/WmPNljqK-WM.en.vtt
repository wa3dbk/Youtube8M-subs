down<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.320> area<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.939> my

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
down in this area and then I will do my

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
down in this area and then I will do my
drawings<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.930> tend<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> draw<00:01:28.500> during<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
drawings but I tend to draw during the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
drawings but I tend to draw during the
day<00:01:28.920> better<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.579> i<00:01:29.729> feel<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
day better because i feel like the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
day better because i feel like the
sunlight<00:01:31.110> natural<00:01:31.530> sunlight<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.250> better

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
sunlight natural sunlight is way better

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.520 
sunlight natural sunlight is way better
than<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.850> our<00:01:33.060> lamp<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.320> feels

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
than using our lamp because if it feels
