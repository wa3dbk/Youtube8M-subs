00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.169
 we are going to make a small network and a cd of lady intendo dc united 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.820
 that came to me three days ago let's see what's inside the area 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.729
 we have in 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 the manual 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.050
 all japan is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 How is normal 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.439
 after that we have sides 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 the wait say 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.620
 let's open the moment 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.620
 post 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 efe 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.990
 a white color knew that 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 in the three modules they will be white 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.600
 and well we have that they do not have piece of rubber for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.020
 not just as a pointer 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.330
 as we say wrong 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 after that country 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.720
 We parked the ds lite 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.720
 and we continue to deny that inside the box 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 We have been 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 it was clear why I can not 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.250
 because I'm still waiting for the European day seven days 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 join a style that has replaced 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.220
 the color blue 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 with the employer 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.020
 and inside the boxes are 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 then the instructions of pita chat 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 also japan is clear 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 and a card from the nintendo club knew what the equivalence will be 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 to the stars that we have here 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.569
 I do not use the console 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.569
 we leave the box 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.829
 oscar 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 Well, there it is 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.949
 let's see anything 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:32.959
 outside 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.509
 first of all 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.109
 here we have 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.839
 he has a cajalón 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.839
 where are the games going and where are they going to 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:46.840
 we do not have no 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 and here we have the volume 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.879
 for the entity headphones 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.969
 and here we have for the gea games that nicknamed the capital protests 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.779
 there to the side 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.809
 tel 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.109
 the power button 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 where is the style 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 we will act abiyán 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.109
 the buttons then the crosshead and quite soft 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.149
 is similar to the very micro art 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.179
 here the buttons that we have to be the select 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:33.459
 add xi as always also quite soft 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.279
 and from behind 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.249
 redon 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.249
 with haiti and the button 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.209
 so now attend 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.959
 to inform 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.559
 May for example 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.749
 in May 64 I have you more at hand 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:07.279
 well here we see that Cuban tells us and the game in the first one that I put 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.279
 because the board does not use it 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.949
 we do not understand over there 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.590
 and here we have indicated 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.590
 pinelake health is green at the moment 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.889
 come on that the dress with jeans and collar 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.360
 the style is the biggest displaced a little fatter is bigger than that of 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 from the time 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.909
 min 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.719
 my time and whenever we have mario 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.729
 s 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.219
 special 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.919
 and download etc 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.020
 the time to see it airs is not different species have track a trot and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.710
 different levels of luminosity 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.710
 you feel 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.080
 they arrive more is not pure 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.179
 a little clearer clearer and also clear of all 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.249
 the camera I know you can not 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.249
 visualizing quite well but you must tell 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.249
 here we see as the tenth week later what 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.889
 the calendar 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.749
 battery level the hour a day 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.930
 and the name of users 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 we give to the maribor 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.069
 yes 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.069
 6 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.719
 Cubans 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.979
 now we are at the lowest level of education 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 joint 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.550
 h cd very well 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.729
 although it is on screen so that these are very dominated the first level of 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.430
 Bolduc and then nothing else 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.180
 placed in some states 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.689
 let's spend the night 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 who are interested in 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.699
 I think the text 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.699
 good angels cyrus 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.869
 Well the oti motivates the tactic of the battery and say but shortly after 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.389
 one by one 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.389
 vuoso solecki toxo alerted 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:58.369
 It's not like I think anything else as soon as I have 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.479
 some other former treasurer as well as 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.999
