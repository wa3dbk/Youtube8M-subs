00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
break down is to absorb the pressure

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.220 
break down is to absorb the pressure
steal<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> ball<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.450> try<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> counter<00:00:39.989> so

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.420 
midfield too and then you have two one
now<00:01:13.979> when<00:01:14.939> teams<00:01:15.799> try<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> swing<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> ball

together<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:33.900> go

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
together so they go this way and they go

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
together so they go this way and they go
this<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> swing<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.340> fast

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

it'll kind of stretch them out that's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.520 
it'll kind of stretch them out that's
why<00:01:38.729> diagonal<00:01:39.180> balls<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:40.350> side

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
why diagonal balls from one side

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.880 
why diagonal balls from one side
together<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:41.100> stretches<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:42.890> so

we'll kind of play this through and see
how<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.079> goes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.240 

so<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.269> balls<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.690> wing<00:03:12.980> how<00:03:13.980> does<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.160> go

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so the balls on the wing how does it go

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.569 
so the balls on the wing how does it go
through<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.790> obvious<00:03:18.269> if<00:03:18.359> he<00:03:18.450> lose<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:19.579> but

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.240 
through and obvious if he lose it but
this<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.000> another<00:03:21.269> dangerous<00:03:21.660> thing<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.250> when

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
this is another dangerous thing to when

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.890 
this is another dangerous thing to when
you<00:03:23.310> try<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> go<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.849> counter<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.690> lose

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
you try to go in a counter and you lose

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.140

it<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.950> other<00:03:26.069> thing<00:03:26.250> come<00:03:26.430> back<00:03:26.579> as<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.910> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
it the other thing come back as you and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.420 
it the other thing come back as you and
your<00:03:27.239> shapes<00:03:27.480> not<00:03:27.720> as<00:03:27.810> good<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.530> look<00:03:32.310> that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
your shapes not as good so look that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.849 
your shapes not as good so look that
play<00:03:32.609> through<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.780> why<00:03:33.959> four<00:03:34.739> three

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
play through and that's why four three

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.559 
play through and that's why four three
two<00:03:35.040> your<00:03:35.459> defense<00:03:35.730> formation<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.359> shape

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
two your defense formation the shape

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.720 
two your defense formation the shape
that<00:03:36.780> balance<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.380> important<00:03:37.859> when<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.099> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that balance is so important when a the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.550 
that balance is so important when a the
team<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.840> generally<00:03:40.109> have<00:03:40.230> more<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
team will generally have more of the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.819 
team will generally have more of the
possession<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.930> know<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.739> way

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
possession you know and this is the way

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.379 
possession you know and this is the way
