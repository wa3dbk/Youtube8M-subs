00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
look quite good in blue though so it

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.409 
look quite good in blue though so it
works<00:04:31.500> out<00:04:31.680> pretty<00:04:31.830> well<00:04:31.979> either<00:04:32.310> way<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.880> the

grenade weapons feature that kind of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.260 
grenade weapons feature that kind of
thing<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:52.860> well<00:04:53.010> they<00:04:53.280> are<00:04:53.430> usually<00:04:53.669> towards

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440

stolen technology the grineer are still
working<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.870> but<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.350> do<00:05:01.530> wonder<00:05:01.860> why<00:05:02.160> we

working on but I do wonder why we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.800 
working on but I do wonder why we
couldn't<00:05:02.340> even<00:05:02.850> be<00:05:02.970> bothered<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.330> do<00:05:03.539> a<00:05:03.570> little

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
couldn't even be bothered to do a little

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
bit of cable management come on now

there<00:05:07.169> is<00:05:07.350> some<00:05:07.650> minor<00:05:07.949> annoyance<00:05:08.490> the

there is some minor annoyance the

there is some minor annoyance the

wide particle effect meaning that while

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.120 
wide particle effect meaning that while
you're<00:05:12.900> aiming<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.380> can<00:05:13.530> be<00:05:13.650> hard<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.979> see

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
you're aiming it can be hard to see

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.219 
you're aiming it can be hard to see
where<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.400> beam<00:05:14.550> actually<00:05:15.120> is<00:05:15.330> which<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.930> kind

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
where the beam actually is which is kind

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.080 
where the beam actually is which is kind
of<00:05:16.380> important<00:05:16.889> because<00:05:17.070> it<00:05:17.280> usually<00:05:17.639> isn't

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
of important because it usually isn't

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.659 
of important because it usually isn't
actually<00:05:18.449> going<00:05:18.870> where<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.169> reticule<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
actually going where the reticule is it

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:21.950 
actually going where the reticule is it
can<00:05:20.850> make<00:05:21.000> precision<00:05:21.330> aiming<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:21.810> bit

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
can make precision aiming a bit

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.719 
can make precision aiming a bit
difficult<00:05:22.169> as<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.590> result<00:05:22.919> but<00:05:23.160> I<00:05:23.220> suppose<00:05:23.550> this

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
difficult as a result but I suppose this

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.279 
difficult as a result but I suppose this
thing<00:05:23.910> isn't<00:05:24.090> exactly<00:05:24.570> meant<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:25.020> precision

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
thing isn't exactly meant for precision

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.100 
thing isn't exactly meant for precision
anyway<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.970> has<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> problem<00:05:27.449> I<00:05:27.720> feel<00:05:27.930> is

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
anyway and it has a problem I feel is

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.290 
anyway and it has a problem I feel is
inherent<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.680> all<00:05:28.800> beam<00:05:29.310> style<00:05:29.669> weapons<00:05:29.940> in

inherent to all beam style weapons in

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.270 
inherent to all beam style weapons in
that<00:05:30.510> it's<00:05:30.660> not<00:05:30.840> especially<00:05:31.200> satisfying<00:05:31.770> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
that it's not especially satisfying to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.730 
that it's not especially satisfying to
use<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:33.450> animals<00:05:33.810> does<00:05:34.020> have<00:05:34.229> pretty<00:05:34.470> nice

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
use the animals does have pretty nice

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.680 
use the animals does have pretty nice
sound<00:05:35.070> assets<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:35.789> which<00:05:35.940> helps<00:05:36.300> but<00:05:36.539> it's

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
sound assets to it which helps but it's

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.120 
sound assets to it which helps but it's
another<00:05:36.930> one<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.169> those<00:05:37.349> point-and-shoot

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
another one of those point-and-shoot

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.129 
another one of those point-and-shoot
weapons<00:05:38.580> which<00:05:38.849> I<00:05:39.030> never<00:05:39.300> really<00:05:39.630> liked<00:05:39.870> much

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
weapons which I never really liked much

those<00:05:40.860> are<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.070> animals<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:41.610> credit<00:05:41.970> I

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
those are the animals is credit I

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.610 
those are the animals is credit I
suppose<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:42.570> doesn't<00:05:42.780> cause<00:05:43.110> random

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620

pointless<00:05:43.979> shaking<00:05:44.550> at<00:05:44.669> least<00:05:44.910> so<00:05:45.300> it<00:05:45.450> isn't

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
pointless shaking at least so it isn't

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.480 
pointless shaking at least so it isn't
actually<00:05:45.930> annoying<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.770> use<00:05:46.950> like<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.190> lot<00:05:47.370> of

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
actually annoying to use like a lot of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.700 
actually annoying to use like a lot of
other<00:05:47.610> things<00:05:47.910> but<00:05:48.570> that's<00:05:48.810> just<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.289> my

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
other things but that's just like my

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.190 
other things but that's just like my
opinion<00:05:50.220> man<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:51.180> animals<00:05:51.539> is<00:05:51.690> an<00:05:51.870> excellent

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
opinion man the animals is an excellent

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.409 
opinion man the animals is an excellent
choices<00:05:52.530> secondary<00:05:53.250> weapon<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.729> is<00:05:54.060> actually

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
choices secondary weapon and is actually

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.180 
choices secondary weapon and is actually
quite<00:05:54.570> efficient<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.200> taking<00:05:55.530> down<00:05:55.560> larger

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
quite efficient to taking down larger

quite efficient to taking down larger
groups<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.580> enemies<00:05:56.699> thanks<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.300> being<00:05:57.419> able

groups of enemies thanks to being able

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.420 
groups of enemies thanks to being able
to<00:05:57.750> hit<00:05:57.900> four<00:05:58.229> targets<00:05:58.470> at<00:05:58.770> once<00:05:58.800> with<00:05:59.220> full

to hit four targets at once with full
force<00:05:59.669> and<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.720> will<00:06:00.870> even<00:06:01.080> continue<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.740> chain

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
force and it will even continue to chain

force and it will even continue to chain
off<00:06:02.099> things<00:06:02.340> like<00:06:02.490> necrosis<00:06:02.940> shadows<00:06:03.449> of<00:06:03.630> the

secondaries out there and it has enough

its own thing though personally I won't

its own thing though personally I won't
