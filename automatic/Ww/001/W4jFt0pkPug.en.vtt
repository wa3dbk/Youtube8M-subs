 the lining is removable very small 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 shops 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.670
 you are stuck with drugs you have too

 extra openings for ventilation 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.739
 air that can come down the slope 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.150
 also great because of the helmet a circular 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.850
