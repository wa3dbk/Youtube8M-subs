your computer and there's another
advantage<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.159> well<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.210> I'll

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
advantage to doing this as well so I'll

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.999 
advantage to doing this as well so I'll
get<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.470> later<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
get into that a little later in the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
get into that a little later in the
video<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.729> let's<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.689> how<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
video but for now let's just see how to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
video but for now let's just see how to
move<00:01:46.409> these<00:01:46.619> sequences<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> would<00:01:48.329> do

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
move these sequences what you would do

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
move these sequences what you would do
is<00:01:48.600> open<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.020> Windows<00:01:49.409> Explorer<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.310> I'll

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is open up Windows Explorer which I'll

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.469

case is the C Drive and the music folder
and<00:02:04.460> let's<00:02:05.460> say<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> want<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.320> music<00:02:07.320> file

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and let's say I want this music file

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.020 
and let's say I want this music file
this<00:02:08.250> mp3<00:02:08.489> I'll<00:02:09.420> copy<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this mp3 I'll copy it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.390 
this mp3 I'll copy it
and<00:02:12.120> move<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.319> directory<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.040> later

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and move it to the directory that later

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.680 
and move it to the directory that later
AMA<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.760> initially<00:02:15.630> looking<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.140> which<00:02:17.040> that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
AMA is initially looking in which that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.150 
AMA is initially looking in which that
directory<00:02:18.690> depends<00:02:19.140> upon<00:02:19.230> how<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.800> have

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
directory depends upon how you have

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.210 
directory depends upon how you have
later<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.730> set<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.680> often<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.980> in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
later on the set up but often it's in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.240 
later on the set up but often it's in
your<00:02:23.459> My<00:02:23.640> Documents<00:02:23.670> folder<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.530> later

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
your My Documents folder and then later

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
your My Documents folder and then later
AMA<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.630> audio<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.569> that's<00:02:30.569> where<00:02:31.110> it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
AMA and then audio and that's where it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.930 
AMA and then audio and that's where it
happens<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.830> my<00:02:31.860> computer<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.640> may<00:02:32.880> be

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
happens to be on my computer it may be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.670 
happens to be on my computer it may be
there<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.330> your<00:02:33.480> computer<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.020> well<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.410> again

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
there on your computer as well but again

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.449 
there on your computer as well but again
it<00:02:35.090> depends<00:02:36.090> how<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.510> later<00:02:36.720> AMA<00:02:36.900> set<00:02:37.140> up

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
it depends how you have later AMA set up

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.100 
it depends how you have later AMA set up
but<00:02:38.459> now<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.970> I'm<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.239> I'll<00:02:39.360> paste<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
but now that I'm here I'll paste the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.699 
but now that I'm here I'll paste the
file<00:02:40.950> into<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.120> directory<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:43.470> let's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
file into this directory and now let's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.250 
file into this directory and now let's
go<00:02:43.860> back<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> sequence<00:02:44.730> editor<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.330> start

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
go back to the sequence editor and start

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.680 
go back to the sequence editor and start
up<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.620> new<00:02:46.769> musical<00:02:47.220> sequence<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.690> there's

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
up a new musical sequence and there's

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.509 
up a new musical sequence and there's
the<00:02:51.870> file<00:02:52.050> right<00:02:52.350> there<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> don't<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the file right there so I don't have to

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.979 
the file right there so I don't have to
go<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> C<00:02:53.970> Drive<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.450> music<00:02:54.780> folder

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
go to the C Drive in the music folder

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.170 
go to the C Drive in the music folder
and<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.440> forth<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.550> select<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.940> file

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and so forth I can just select the file

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
and so forth I can just select the file
and<00:02:57.390> click<00:02:57.560> OK<00:02:59.120> now<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.870> could<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> little

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and click OK now that could be a little

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.040 
and click OK now that could be a little
more<00:03:02.280> convenient<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.420> there's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
more convenient for you but there's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.380 
more convenient for you but there's
another<00:03:04.319> advantage<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.370> well<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:06.120> is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
another advantage to it as well which is

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.949 
another advantage to it as well which is
that<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:07.650> lot<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.130> people<00:03:08.459> use<00:03:09.120> two<00:03:09.780> different

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
that a lot of people use two different

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.640 
that a lot of people use two different
computers<00:03:10.850> for<00:03:11.850> later<00:03:12.180> AMA<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:13.170> use<00:03:13.380> one

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
computers for later AMA they use one

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.310 
computers for later AMA they use one
computer<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.550> do<00:03:15.180> their<00:03:15.390> sequencing<00:03:16.110> to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
computer to do their sequencing to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.500 
computer to do their sequencing to
create<00:03:17.010> their<00:03:17.220> sequences<00:03:17.760> modify<00:03:18.329> their

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
create their sequences modify their

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.960 
create their sequences modify their
sequences<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.260> they<00:03:19.920> use<00:03:20.100> another<00:03:20.459> computer

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
sequences and they use another computer

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.229 
sequences and they use another computer
a<00:03:21.000> separate<00:03:21.450> computer<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.739> run<00:03:23.700> their<00:03:23.940> shows

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
a separate computer to run their shows

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
a separate computer to run their shows
when<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.079> have<00:03:25.260> their<00:03:25.440> actual<00:03:25.620> lights

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
when they have their actual lights

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.650 
when they have their actual lights
hooked<00:03:26.280> up<00:03:26.579> around<00:03:26.880> their<00:03:27.090> house<00:03:27.239> or<00:03:27.480> whatever

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
hooked up around their house or whatever

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.900 
hooked up around their house or whatever
and<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.799> don't<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.760> lot

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
and you don't have to do that but a lot

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.660 
and you don't have to do that but a lot
of<00:03:29.940> people<00:03:30.150> find<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.810> more<00:03:31.769> convenient<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
of people find it more convenient to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
of people find it more convenient to
have<00:03:32.820> two<00:03:33.239> two<00:03:33.630> different<00:03:33.959> computers<00:03:34.170> used<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
have two two different computers used in

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.259 
have two two different computers used in
this<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.400> if<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.320> way<00:03:38.269> the

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
this way and if you do it that way the

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.330 
this way and if you do it that way the
way<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.660> showed<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.110> where<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.130> put

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
way that I just showed you where you put

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.640 
way that I just showed you where you put
the<00:03:41.459> music<00:03:41.579> file<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.540> default<00:03:42.840> spot<00:03:43.230> that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the music file in the default spot that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.300 
the music file in the default spot that
lor<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.190> looking<00:03:44.579> then<00:03:45.480> you'll<00:03:46.230> run<00:03:46.799> into<00:03:46.980> less

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
lor is looking then you'll run into less

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.310 
lor is looking then you'll run into less
problems<00:03:47.850> when<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.269> move<00:03:48.480> your<00:03:48.660> sequences

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
problems when you move your sequences

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.520 
problems when you move your sequences
from<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.250> your<00:03:50.430> mp3<00:03:51.209> files<00:03:51.420> from<00:03:52.260> one

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
from one and your mp3 files from one

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.550 
from one and your mp3 files from one
machine<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.850> other<00:03:54.180> machine<00:03:54.480> if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.320> put

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
machine to the other machine if you put

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.520 
machine to the other machine if you put
it<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.890> default<00:03:56.250> space<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:57.060> both<00:03:58.019> machines

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it in the default space on both machines

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.270 
it in the default space on both machines
and<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.480> guess<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:00.989> about<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.380> took<00:04:02.130> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and so I guess that's about it took the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.519 
and so I guess that's about it took the
cells
