00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
when your VCR does not power out first

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.150 
when your VCR does not power out first
thing<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.890> should<00:00:04.920> check<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:06.270> fuse<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
thing you should check is the fuse and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.940 
thing you should check is the fuse and
with<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.340> type<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.550> older<00:00:08.940> VCR<00:00:09.480> that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
with this type of older VCR that

with this type of older VCR that
contains<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.280> separate<00:00:11.880> power<00:00:12.120> supply<00:00:12.210> block

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840

if<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.920> look<00:00:14.370> at<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.120> opening<00:00:16.369> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> side

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
if you look at the opening on the side

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.779 
if you look at the opening on the side
of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.150> VCR<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> fuse<00:00:20.369> here

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
of the VCR you can see the fuse here

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
of the VCR you can see the fuse here
clearly<00:00:22.580> from<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.109> opening<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.980> remove

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
clearly from this opening here to remove

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730 
clearly from this opening here to remove
the<00:00:29.279> fuse<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> actually<00:00:30.179> quite<00:00:30.390> easy<00:00:30.560> all<00:00:31.560> we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the fuse is actually quite easy all we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.110 
the fuse is actually quite easy all we
need<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> take<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> small<00:00:32.730> screwdriver

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
need to do is take a small screwdriver

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.770 
need to do is take a small screwdriver
and<00:00:33.750> gently<00:00:34.559> remove<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.760> from<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> two<00:00:36.450> clips

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and gently remove it from the two clips

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.860 
and gently remove it from the two clips
holding<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.070> place<00:00:38.309> by<00:00:39.180> inserting<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
holding it in place by inserting the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
holding it in place by inserting the
force<00:00:40.760> upward<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.989> end<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.789> then<00:00:49.370> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
force upward on one end and then you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.410 
force upward on one end and then you
will<00:00:50.550> pop<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.079> then<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.440> take

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
will pop up and then you can take

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.830 
will pop up and then you can take
something<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.260> Twitter<00:01:04.580> remove<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.840> how

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
something like a Twitter remove it how

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800 
something like a Twitter remove it how
do<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> tell<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.650> fuse<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> good<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.810> look

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
do you tell if a fuse is good just look

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.530 
do you tell if a fuse is good just look
at<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.500> wire<00:01:10.710> inside<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.939> example<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
at the wire inside for example in this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.740 
at the wire inside for example in this
fuse<00:01:13.400> even<00:01:14.400> though<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.640> coated<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.450> color

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
fuse even though it's coated with color

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
fuse even though it's coated with color
on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> outside<00:01:16.350> glass<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> still<00:01:17.970> see

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
on the outside glass you can still see

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
on the outside glass you can still see
there<00:01:18.570> say<00:01:20.030> unbroken<00:01:21.030> wire<00:01:21.450> inside<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
there say unbroken wire inside and that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.050 
there say unbroken wire inside and that
is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> fuse<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:25.380> typical<00:01:25.890> example<00:01:26.549> would

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
is the fuse a more typical example would

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.749 
is the fuse a more typical example would
be<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:28.520> fuse<00:01:29.520> without<00:01:29.810> color<00:01:30.810> coating<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
be a fuse without color coating on the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.560 
be a fuse without color coating on the
glass<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:34.549> here<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:37.549> now<00:01:38.549> compare<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
glass and here it is now compare this to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.480 
glass and here it is now compare this to
some<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> broken<00:01:40.200> fuses<00:01:41.750> for<00:01:42.750> example

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
some of the broken fuses for example

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.620 
some of the broken fuses for example
this<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.920> has<00:01:46.920> broken<00:01:47.430> wire<00:01:49.070> or<00:01:50.630> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this one that has broken wire or this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
this one that has broken wire or this
one<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.860> had<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> fuse<00:01:53.430> completely<00:01:54.119> blew<00:01:54.360> up

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
one that had the fuse completely blew up

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.370 
one that had the fuse completely blew up
inside<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.549> coated<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.360> glass<00:01:58.250> over<00:02:00.380> or

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
inside and coated the glass over or

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.920 
inside and coated the glass over or
here's<00:02:02.040> another<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.649> basically<00:02:05.930> melted

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
here's another one that basically melted

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.440 
here's another one that basically melted
onto<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> glass

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.040 

here<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.570> another<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:16.720> has<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.780> broken

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
here is another one that has a broken

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280 
here is another one that has a broken
wire<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.910> those<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.600> signs<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.110> should

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
wire so those are the signs you should

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.120 
wire so those are the signs you should
look<00:02:21.350> for<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.220> broken<00:02:22.550> fuse<00:02:26.770> when<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> need

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
look for in a broken fuse when you need

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.060 
look for in a broken fuse when you need
to<00:02:28.280> replace<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.850> damage<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.360> fuse<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.890> need

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
to replace the damage to fuse you need

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.770 
to replace the damage to fuse you need
to<00:02:31.160> replace<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.940> one<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.360> has<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.600> same

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
to replace it with one that has the same

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.310 
to replace it with one that has the same
rating<00:02:33.670> for<00:02:34.670> example<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.690> 250

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
rating for example if you have a 250

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.700 
rating for example if you have a 250
volt<00:02:36.560> 2<00:02:37.130> amp<00:02:37.340> fuse<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.600> best<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.050> replace<00:02:39.290> it

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
volt 2 amp fuse it's best to replace it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.970 
volt 2 amp fuse it's best to replace it
with<00:02:40.250> identical<00:02:40.790> views<00:02:41.650> however<00:02:42.650> sometimes

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
with identical views however sometimes

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.700 
with identical views however sometimes
it<00:02:43.670> can<00:02:43.970> be<00:02:44.000> difficult<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.780> find<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.290> fuse<00:02:45.530> of

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
it can be difficult to find the fuse of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.030 
it can be difficult to find the fuse of
the<00:02:46.610> same<00:02:46.820> rating<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.960> still<00:02:48.260> need<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.830> follow

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
the same rating you still need to follow

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.030 
the same rating you still need to follow
at<00:02:49.430> least<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.750> current<00:02:51.140> rating<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.010> fuse

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
at least the current rating on the fuse

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.730 
at least the current rating on the fuse
so<00:02:52.940> if<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.490> 125<00:02:55.490> volt<00:02:55.760> 2<00:02:56.390> amp<00:02:56.570> fuse<00:02:56.960> you

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
so if it is a 125 volt 2 amp fuse you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.180 
so if it is a 125 volt 2 amp fuse you
still<00:02:58.010> need<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.250> replace<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:58.880> a<00:03:00.190> fuse

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
still need to replace it with a fuse

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.510 
still need to replace it with a fuse
that<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.610> at<00:03:02.060> least<00:03:02.120> rated<00:03:03.020> for<00:03:03.230> two<00:03:03.380> m93<00:03:04.340> amp

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
that is at least rated for two m93 amp

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.720 
that is at least rated for two m93 amp
not<00:03:04.910> 1.5<00:03:05.450> amp<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:06.500> okay<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.920> replace<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.610> with

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
not 1.5 amp it's okay to replace it with

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.140 
not 1.5 amp it's okay to replace it with
a<00:03:07.850> higher<00:03:08.120> voltage<00:03:08.560> fuse<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.220> if<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.460> have<00:03:10.580> 125

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
a higher voltage fuse so if you have 125

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
a higher voltage fuse so if you have 125
volt<00:03:11.390> fuse<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.620> uses<00:03:12.920> 2<00:03:13.100> amp<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.850> can

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
volt fuse that uses 2 amp you can

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.210 
volt fuse that uses 2 amp you can
replace<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.330> with<00:03:14.630> 250<00:03:15.200> volt<00:03:15.470> 2<00:03:16.430> amp<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:17.390> not

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
replace it with 250 volt 2 amp but not

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.510 
replace it with 250 volt 2 amp but not
lower<00:03:19.220> current<00:03:19.760> or<00:03:20.090> higher<00:03:20.270> current<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:22.160> that

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
lower current or higher current so that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.000 
lower current or higher current so that
is<00:03:23.240> very<00:03:23.540> important<00:03:24.050> when<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.530> replace<00:03:24.800> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
is very important when you replace the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.270 
is very important when you replace the
fuse<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.520> you<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.780> use<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> fuse<00:03:27.980> with<00:03:28.250> a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
fuse and you don't use a fuse with a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.420 
fuse and you don't use a fuse with a
lower<00:03:28.520> voltage<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:30.140> if<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.470> have<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> 125<00:03:31.220> volt

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
lower voltage so if you have a 125 volt

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.910 
lower voltage so if you have a 125 volt
fuse<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:32.360> replace<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.900> with<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> 50<00:03:33.709> volt

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
fuse don't replace it with a 50 volt

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.559 
fuse don't replace it with a 50 volt
views<00:03:34.250> even<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.240> they<00:03:35.420> are<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> same<00:03:35.690> current

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.800 

and<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.859> fuse<00:03:42.129> is<00:03:42.310> intact<00:03:42.700> then<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.629> might

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and if the fuse is intact then you might

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.720 
and if the fuse is intact then you might
want<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.140> troubleshoot<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> power<00:03:45.310> supply

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
want to troubleshoot the power supply

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.599 
want to troubleshoot the power supply
