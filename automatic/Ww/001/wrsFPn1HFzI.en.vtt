00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.470
 and how about youtube people I hope that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 find today pretty well and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
 good on this occasion we go directly 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.720
 To the point several hours ago he started 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 make scandal for some supposed 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.220
 Filtered images of halo 5 in total 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.350
 They are 4 and they are the ones that I am showing you 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.150
 right now one of them has a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.619
 viewer showing three types of grenades 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 although all are grenades 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.760
 fragmentation we have a carbine and a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 magnum together with a phantom background 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 in addition to new elements in the viewer 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 there's even a mention of the jetpack and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 Of course you could not miss the classic logo of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 three four industries that appears in 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.700
 every alleged leak they have taken 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 so far the other images more than 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 nothing show supposed locations of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 fire I would like to do an analysis 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 deep based on these images but 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 I think it's not worth it in my opinion 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 They are fake because good since it started 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 the year there have been many new rumors 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 of trailers and filtered halo images 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 5 surprisingly each and every one of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.160
 those leaks have been shown as 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.809
 a total fake I must admit that these 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.610
 new images look more real than 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 the previous ones but like the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.529
 previous is more than obvious that they are fake 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.179
 this same thing happened with halo 4 in 2012 

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:06.930
 the first months were full of 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.180
 filtration 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.370
 and other rumors most if not that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 all turned out to be fake the one that has 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.060
 the three four logo and placed on the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 image does not mean it's true the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.110
 reality is that I'm almost sure that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 in the next days or maybe in the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 next time someone will find the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.440
 evidence that they are 100% fake although to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 my opinion does not need evidence 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.400
 to demonstrate the falsity of the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 images is to say I think most already 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.150
 We know from our own experience that this 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.130
 kind of things are usually a total hoax 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 This is not the first nor the last time 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.580
 that someone will post their images 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.530
 edited and upload them to the internet for 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.360
 earn your five minutes of fame the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 next weeks will continue to be surrounded by 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 this kind of thing so please the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
 next time you see some things 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 as images or videos of this type only 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.050
 have an open mind and think about the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.610
 chances are not many 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 illusions since usually always 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 they will turn out to be a fake to make them 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.910
 sincere these images remind me of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.040
 all those halo games fan made that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.560
 many have tried to develop for pc 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 as hello galaxy and halo contingency 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.149
 besides that chaperone looks too 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.679
 halo style 3 on my part I consider that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.510
 it was important to make this video for 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.650
 give them my opinion and they should have more 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.629
 Be careful what you believe 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 many of my classmates including me 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.409
 of course we will be seeing surely 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.450
 videos with information that maybe 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.549
 see very real but we can even be 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.439
 wrong so until three four 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.569
 and do not start revealing gameplays and more 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.819
 truly revealing material leaves 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.739
 5 or any other project the best 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.450
 would not be excited about this kind of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.400
 things I also screwed up with 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.470
 some things since halo was announced 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 5 but I think he has learned from many 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.159
 of my mistakes since I started giving 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.379
 the news so it's better to leave this 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.060
 kind of things aside just do not 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.069
 are worth it for now I think that I 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.049
 I will concentrate only on talking about 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.150
 other aspects of my channel like the 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.319
 escalation my angel universe section 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.299
 or where he talked about the details 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.519
 specific to the story and even 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.530
 informative videos about testing is the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.939
 best way to keep the channel active 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.549
 in what triumphed tri decides to show 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.920
 something new probably in the gdc of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.689
 this year and if it would not be until the e3 to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.760
 you are free to believe or not 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.349
 in this kind of thing I'm not the one to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.420
 determine the veracity of some 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.310
 news so I will leave it at your discretion 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.379
 just remember everything that I was 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.299
 mentioning in this good video this has 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.010
 been all from me today a 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.640
 short video but at the same time considered 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.440
 necessary 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
 I certainly wanted to tell you that starting 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.490
 now I have more active my account 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.410
 twitter if after so much time 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.000
 I learned to use twitter so I did not 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.069
 hesitate to follow me because if they have 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.709
 Any questions or questions you can send me 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.440
 via twitter I will try to answer everything 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.090
 what you send me seriously everything and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.500
 finally I leave this box 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.120
 that will take you to a video of a user 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.130
 called a 'double that takes care of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.170
 make your own maid fan of menus 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.510
 some games on your channel has so much 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.610
 I destiny like halo so I will leave you your 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.380
 own version of the halo menu 5 though 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.600
 it's simple I think it really is very 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.280
 good to have absolutely nothing 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.650
 of the game I say goodbye not before 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.570
 send greetings to my celestial friend who 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.340
 for some reason I always watch my videos 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.230
 Although he has no idea what 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.910
 I speak in them I am blood metal and we 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.910
 we will see in the next video
