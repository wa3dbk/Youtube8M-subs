00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
on the plate so I think if I lick my
finger<00:01:01.350> maybe<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.190> could<00:01:02.520> pick<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
finger maybe I could pick up some of

little crumbly bits on the side of the
cake<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.350> maybe<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> knife
