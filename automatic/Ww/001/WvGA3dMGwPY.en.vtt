00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
how this one was done it wasn't quite

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
how this one was done it wasn't quite
toxic<00:01:23.250> enough<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:24.030> directly<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
toxic enough to use directly like the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
toxic enough to use directly like the
most<00:01:25.170> toxic<00:01:25.410> dart<00:01:25.800> frog<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.370> they<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
most toxic dart frog so what they do is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
most toxic dart frog so what they do is
it<00:01:26.880> harvests<00:01:27.390> several<00:01:27.900> frogs<00:01:28.250> over<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> couple

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
it harvests several frogs over a couple

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
it harvests several frogs over a couple
of<00:01:29.760> weeks<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.680> generally<00:01:32.130> old

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of weeks and then they get generally old

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.150 
of weeks and then they get generally old
early<00:01:32.760> older<00:01:33.420> women<00:01:33.660> that<00:01:34.620> were<00:01:34.710> tired<00:01:34.950> of

early older women that were tired of

early older women that were tired of
living<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.510> they<00:01:36.690> go<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.140> hillside

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
living and they go up on the hillside

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.700 
living and they go up on the hillside
now<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> ceremony<00:01:38.720> Stoke<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> fire<00:01:40.229> bring

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
now to ceremony Stoke up the fire bring

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
now to ceremony Stoke up the fire bring
the<00:01:40.830> toxins<00:01:41.220> close<00:01:41.430> enough<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> fire<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the toxins close enough to the fire so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
the toxins close enough to the fire so
it<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.810> still<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> moisture

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it would just still down the moisture

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370 
it would just still down the moisture
and<00:01:44.100> increase<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> potency<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> toxin<00:01:45.900> at

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and increase the potency of the toxin at

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
and increase the potency of the toxin at
the<00:01:46.560> same<00:01:46.770> though<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.280> toxin<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.760> be<00:01:47.880> put

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the same though that toxin would be put

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
the same though that toxin would be put
into<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> atmosphere<00:01:48.600> around<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.320> fire<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
into the atmosphere around the fire and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
into the atmosphere around the fire and
this<00:01:49.800> would<00:01:49.979> generally<00:01:50.490> kill<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> tendras<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this would generally kill the tendras of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
this would generally kill the tendras of
the<00:01:51.840> fire<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.860> join<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.250> period<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.970> fire

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the fire will join that period the fire

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
the fire will join that period the fire
would<00:01:54.330> they<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:56.100> rest

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
would they want to go out and the rest

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
would they want to go out and the rest
of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.910> Indians<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> come<00:01:57.479> back<00:01:57.630> safely<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
of the Indians can come back safely and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.310
