come up here go ahead and tap on that to
bring<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
bring it up and what this is is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840 
bring it up and what this is is
basically<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.509> Japanese<00:01:16.049> RSS<00:01:16.710> reader<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
basically it's a Japanese RSS reader it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.780 
basically it's a Japanese RSS reader it
is<00:01:18.060> 99<00:01:18.479> cents<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is 99 cents so if you want to get the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.899 
is 99 cents so if you want to get the
emoticons<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.710> cost<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> roughly<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
emoticons I will just cost you roughly a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.560 
emoticons I will just cost you roughly a
dollar<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.049> bad<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> read

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
dollar so it's not that bad if you read

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.429 
dollar so it's not that bad if you read
Japanese<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.439> guess<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.439> little

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
Japanese I guess this might be a little

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.819 
Japanese I guess this might be a little
useful<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:34.040> once<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:36.680> download<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
useful to you so once you download and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
useful to you so once you download and
install<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.060> ahead<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> bring

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
install that we go ahead here and bring

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.130 
install that we go ahead here and bring
it<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.710> should<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.579> your

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140

homepage there so just go ahead and tap
on<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> few<00:01:47.460> seconds<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
on that will take a few seconds here to
