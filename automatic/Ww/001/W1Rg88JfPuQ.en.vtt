00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.390
 I came to tell you the secret to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.279
 truth is not a secret because sounds are 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 three products 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 I pass the 2nd and 3rd netta out of order 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.300
 here but finally there are three steps 1 2 and 3 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.730
 What is the deep cleaning soap 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.580
 astringent tonic and moisturizer as well as 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 my skin is very curious even oily 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 I suffered too much from this problem of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 Excessive oiliness on the skin is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.020
 embarrassing sometimes but I this kit 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.549
 here I am thus noticing a difference 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 on my skin 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.540
 my skin is silky is more than 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 climbing only knows how to hydrate that skin 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 so oily so a hydration so 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:36.479
 that we see that it is so healthy 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 Ok it's first and the soap here is the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.210
 cast it is that not so but I O 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 with him has this little version that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.780
 30 ml each product of this version 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 tiny 30 ml and has the free version 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.149
 also that the soap in the large version 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:03.600
 are 130 ml otoni per the higher version are 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.790
 200 ml and the facial moisturizer with 50 ml 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.130
 What I found from the kit is a great one yet 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 not 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.690
 I started is never the same as the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.610
 little that is not good to carry in the bag 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.489
 you work it comes with a supply 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.620
 Ashes a nÃ©cessaire is so you 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.630
 put the products here 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.849
 the cotton capuchin leads to the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.430
 work for you to use so it 's okay 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.290
 practical is great for you to use in 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.640
 home but actually like at work 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 Outside, I'm a housewife. I'm a housewife. 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.380
 I finally bought it and got it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.000
 neither the first and after it arrived 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 Big for me so I'm running out. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.980
 to use what you define is before the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.989
 soap has 5% acid is deceased rich 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.459
 That's the way it is, I do not know if I 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.799
 I'm talking right and let's search where 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.890
 It's written that you do not want to talk nonsense. 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.470
 for you salicylic's right has only 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.660
 five percent ok I think it is 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.620
 enough because every product that has 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.890
 this compound and drag member to 0.5 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.200
 percent actually soap is the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.290
 next you will wash they indicate 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 use twice a day in the morning and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.069
 night 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.120
 Ok so during your personal hygiene 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.140
 huh 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.630
 if you're from taif you'll give me your 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.450
 normal face when normal tap 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.700
 is going to put a little bit of this product 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.799
 had and transparent 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:39.040
 I got there normal it 's transparent 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:43.329
 unmercifully 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.489
 so this is how you will apply it 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.910
 on damp skin for it does not do much 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.459
 foam're not you will sanitize your right 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.280
 face will normally wait 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.650
 There you go as well as cotton. 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 water a tonic that is the second step 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.840
 which is that of foreigners will apply the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.430
 You know all skin right? 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.590
 and last you come with dealing noise 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.230
 spread the skin well moisturizing 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.570
 read is white so he is well 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:26.530
 liquid are all the same filled 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:28.330
 so it is not oily and the soap in 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.400
 liquid transparent gel water 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.520
 transparent also the tonic 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.860
 so that's the way folks are I'm liking 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.430
 lots of use of these three products here 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.790
 I complement my whole care 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.199
 Time when I go to sleep, baby, and I'll pass. 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.710
 in the eye area 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:51.040
 here below and up on the eyelid one 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.070
 meeting that is for all ages 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.030
 is it recommended for all ages 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:03.490
 It is firmness, not for fine lines. 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:07.500
 it is the beauty aecid fine lines of 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.639
 expression and is also the appearance of 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.620
 dark circles 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.560
 It's a white creature that you 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.840
 apply to the dark circles and the 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.780
 transparent so you apply 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.990
 the eyelid up into the shadows and 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.120
 very simple so I can do this 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.840
 the hydration being so I do what 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.780
 I also do this step of the eye but it is 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.780
 another product in another video I showed 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.050
 for you on video I making the step to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.990
 step of these three with the other king but 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.180
 I finally came to say that it was this 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.030
 product and so personal I am 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.009
 really like I do feel him 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.970
 is controlling the oiliness of the 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.740
 my skin 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.220
 my skin is not singing oily 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.750
 so I liked May with enough 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.280
 even I recommend do not know so if 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.190
 depends on each person and each person 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.199
 Sometimes it worked out so well for me. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.569
 give it all to you 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.080
 Okay, but it's only you to consult your 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:14.319
 doctor to see that you can 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.930
 pass on your skin that you are not because 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.380
 you can spend what you can not 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.650
 finally 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.680
 I recommend taking plenty of water if 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.430
 moisturize during the day because this 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.010
 also helps a lot the skin stays 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.230
 well luscious pretty well so drink 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.190
 pretty liquid, right? 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:39.040
 avoid being exposed so the neon sun 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.530
 long face is exposed to the sun use 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.330
 moisturizing sunscreen 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:49.360
 Anyway, I really liked this product and 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.260
 I recommend seriously folks recommend the 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.630
 even touch well that's it I just came here 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.700
 So I can talk about this product for you.
