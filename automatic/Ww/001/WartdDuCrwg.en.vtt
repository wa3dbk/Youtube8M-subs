00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
 at 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.690
 we 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 we 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 we 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 we 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.210
 thierry how easy it is rather well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.440
 here we confirmed the settings we have 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.160
 a few small changes 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.800
 Qualify it was not too bad I passed 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.180
 I was not quite happy with 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.670
 unfold I missed a bit the parm 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.450
 after that the chrono was there so I 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.650
 I will not complain are in part 2d 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.280
 of those not at all I was expecting 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.300
 because he takes 1 or 3 he took 2 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.580
 that's pretty good for me because 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.190
 I wanted 3rd on the road so I 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.920
 seen that's what I would like is first 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.100
 feed for nepal to corsican thursday 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.930
 quite a lot there was a lot 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.910
 rain could be puddles 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.710
 it's even if I think the grife 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.810
 it goes from sea to the first car 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.060
 on the road 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.950
 at least if his harp the record I had 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.970
 not empty the flames my goal the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.730
 victory win yes and no I think 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.569
 than 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.390
 the goal of the moment is to finish 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.920
 second in the championship after we go on 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.730
 will have to stall a little on the race 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.760
 aromatics 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.739
 if now in him the front and they 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.489
 may be in more points in 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.300
 the power stage 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.270
 I must at least finish third 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.730
 to stay second so here I have 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.320
 not many choices we open the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.590
 next week come a troop 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.420
 normally yes so it's planned so first 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.720
