00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 what car to buy when u 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.960
 you have a big family and not so much money 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.550
 much to afford seven-seater 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 SUV correct 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.020
 minivan and today we'll talk about one thing 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 of the most inexpensive warriors in Russian 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:28.529
 the market 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:31.080
 chevrolet orlando big car 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.830
 big trunk you and I say with you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 agree 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.510
 but Orlando modestly say nothing if 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 all three rows of seats are involved then 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 the volume of its luggage compartment will be 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 only 89 liters plus in this case 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.930
 it will be something that will be in a small underground 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 hidden organizer for the jack and other 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.129
 useful things if the third row 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.000
 the seat at the moment does not need it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.190
 folds into a flat floor and you get 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.489
 454 liters of fair volume and if 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 pushing the load over the roof then all 727 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 but if this turns out to be not enough, then 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.250
 fold and the second row of seats also in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.909
 flat floor 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 thanks to what you get 1588 liters 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 useful volume and if you wish you can 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 even arrange there a double bed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.159
 the bed is probably the only drawback 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 trunk is the lack of room for 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.330
 spare wheel because of what she migrated 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.330
 bottoms are not critical but still 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 second row passengers 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.140
 enough in the legs and above your head 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030
 of the elements of comfort here is the armrest 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 with cup holders and opportunity 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.410
 backrest adjustment minus can 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 call not the ability to move the seat 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.150
 longitudinally get on the third row in no way 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.920
 harder than any other thanks 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.470
 impressive doorway and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 competent folding system 2 rows when 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.310
 this with the space in the legs and above 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 head on the gallery everything is as good as 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.660
 and on the second row that's just landing 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.670
 rather low feeling of low 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.710
 shop for children though for example in the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 time from the elements of comfort here only 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:14.250
 deflectors in front did not duct 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.690
 it will be difficult to work even for people 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 two meters tall 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170
 the seat does not say to the best of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.510
 which I happened to sit but quite 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 comfortable to sit down and not get tired of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 long trips and even in spite 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.410
 the fact that in its class orlando 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.120
 is budget looks great 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 Of course plastic oak but a feeling 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.230
 cheap in the car is not on the one hand 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 everything is very similar to one platform 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 chevrolet cruze nickname and the other looks 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
 much more attractive 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 as for the quality of multimedia 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.270
 installation then the sound is quite decent 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.980
 level 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.110
 and the navigation is pretty frisky and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.360
 it is convenient to use it from branded 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.280
 Chevrolet chips are pretty solid 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.230
 cache behind the multimedia control unit 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.680
 Yes, and in general there is much small things 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680
 shove up 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.230
 the driver will also be comfortable enough 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.900
 driving the first and most significant plus 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.790
 I would note visibility first because 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.860
 that many automakers have become 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.720
 often sin small side 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.550
 mirrors and chur bloated 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.530
 front struts true to force 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.780
 dimensions of the car from Parktronic 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.480
 I do not recommend to give up the second plus 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.360
 It is a convenient music control wheel well 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.549
 and of course controllability looking outside 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.860
 on this Hippo never thought 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.380
 what could so exercise rulitsya 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.459
 snake car passed like 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.440
 average car at the same time 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.690
 any serious rolls or 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 buildup body was not noticed and yes 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.530
 just at high speed road 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.780
 keeps cars confidently without annoying 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.299
 drivers are nervous behavior in underwear or 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.549
 just on the bumps also notice for 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.130
 Russia Orlando slightly raised thanks 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.019
 what the ground clearance is not 140 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.690
 and all 160 millimeters 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.579
 so that our realities are a definite plus 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.220
 no less crossovers from this orlando not 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.060
 became so his patrimony is asphalt and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.060
 good graphics 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.580
 and now a couple of spoons of tar engine in the January 8 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.599
 liter and not enough for anyway 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.849
 active ride 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.280
 and in our case was just such a motor 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.900
 developing 141 horsepower and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.940
 aggregated six-speed 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.129
 as a result of the machine so that the machine even 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.289
 somehow the engine went constantly 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.889
 twist out of here immediately two 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.169
 Problems 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.900
 first you are unlikely to fit into the specified 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.110
 manufacturer fuel consumption 2 cabin 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.849
 constantly noise of the motor is of course an exit 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.199
 From this situation, select the version with 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.099
 2-liter turbodiesel 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.169
 developing 163 horses and 360 newtons 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.150
 moment dynamics will be determined where 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.490
 more interesting especially in the loaded 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.229
 state of the problem is only that diesel 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.880
 in our market only available in 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.460
 top picking ltz 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.449
 and costs 90 thousand more than gasoline 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.449
 same version 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.340
 Orlandoâ€™s security is all 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.590
 okay, as should be a family 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.870
 car euro eurocap machine 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.120
 received five stars or 95 out of 100 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.750
 possible points with even side 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.210
 hitting the pillar 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.130
 the machine is his main complaints am 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.080
 were not the best results when hitting the 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.080
 pedestrian already very hard hood 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.250
 Well, let's summarize chevrolet orlando 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.199
 turned out great practical and 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.090
 relatively inexpensive 7 seater 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.340
 car that's just with a ruler 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.740
 the engines he obviously didn't have old 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.560
 1 8 liter aspirated weak 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.810
 and diesel is expensive strange that jim is not 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.080
 expanded the line of available pawn themes 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.120
 more than that they have excellent 14 and 16 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.889
 liter petrol turbo with 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.919
 which Orlando felt by itself 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.320
 great on this I put everything 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.040
 likes subscribe to the channel and to new 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.040
 meeting
