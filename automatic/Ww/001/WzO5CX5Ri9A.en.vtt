00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
long leaf breeze I fully expect that we

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.780 
long leaf breeze I fully expect that we
will<00:00:05.910> replace<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:07.069> models<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.340> are

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
will replace it with models that are

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.830 
will replace it with models that are
prettier<00:00:09.719> more<00:00:10.469> refined<00:00:11.090> whose<00:00:12.090> joints<00:00:12.599> fit

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
prettier more refined whose joints fit

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.670 
prettier more refined whose joints fit
better<00:00:15.289> but<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.920> gets<00:00:17.250> us<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:18.680> the

doesn't work well in a composting toilet

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.700 
doesn't work well in a composting toilet

because you want the well doesn't work
well<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.190> our<00:00:44.879> model<00:00:46.100> ok<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> lift

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
well in our model ok I'm going to lift

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
well in our model ok I'm going to lift
up<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> lid<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> inner<00:00:51.600> working<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> the

up the lid and the inner working of the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
up the lid and the inner working of the
composting<00:00:53.489> toilet<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.600> 5<00:00:55.020> gallon<00:00:55.289> plastic

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
composting toilet is a 5 gallon plastic

composting toilet is a 5 gallon plastic
buckets<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.879> bought<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.690> Home<00:00:57.870> Depot

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
buckets we bought these at Home Depot

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.920 
buckets we bought these at Home Depot
they're<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> Homer<00:00:59.039> buckets<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.660> I<00:01:00.660> think

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they're the Homer buckets and I think

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
they're the Homer buckets and I think
when<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> buy<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> lid<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.550> maybe

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
when you buy one with a lid it's maybe

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
when you buy one with a lid it's maybe
four<00:01:03.660> four<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> half<00:01:04.229> dollars<00:01:04.769> something

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
four four and a half dollars something

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820 
four four and a half dollars something
like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.540> bought<00:01:06.810> four<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
like that and I bought four of them so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330 
like that and I bought four of them so
that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.900> take<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> bucket<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> lid

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that we can take a bucket out put a lid

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
that we can take a bucket out put a lid
on<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.659> feel<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:12.930> we've<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> run

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
on it and not feel like we've got to run

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.999 
on it and not feel like we've got to run
to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> compost<00:01:14.220> pile<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:14.820> away<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.890> as

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to the compost pile right away but as

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.670 
to the compost pile right away but as
you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.090> were<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.350> more

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you can see if you were to have a more

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.640 
you can see if you were to have a more
elongated<00:01:20.250> seat<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:23.189> might<00:01:23.430> leave<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.650> portion

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
elongated seat you might leave a portion

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.670 
elongated seat you might leave a portion
of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.280> bucket<00:01:26.640> exposed<00:01:27.360> which<00:01:27.750> doesn't<00:01:28.650> work

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of the bucket exposed which doesn't work

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
of the bucket exposed which doesn't work
well<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> compromises

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
well so that's one of the compromises

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870 
well so that's one of the compromises
you<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> composting

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
handle then this right now it's got a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
handle then this right now it's got a
little<00:01:50.790> wood<00:01:51.060> ash<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> bottom<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:51.990> all

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
then when we get three or four buckets

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.069 
then when we get three or four buckets
full<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> a<00:02:00.210> composting

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
full we will take them to a composting

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
full we will take them to a composting
pile<00:02:01.290> which<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.710> hope<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.579> operation

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pile which I hope to have in operation
