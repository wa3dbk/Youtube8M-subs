marble floor and it broke so the thing
isn't<00:06:27.690> quite<00:06:27.930> um<00:06:29.690> kind<00:06:30.690> of<00:06:30.750> jagged<00:06:31.170> at<00:06:31.320> the

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
isn't quite um kind of jagged at the

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.030 
isn't quite um kind of jagged at the
moment<00:06:31.770> um<00:06:32.250> which<00:06:32.730> kind<00:06:33.060> of<00:06:33.120> gives<00:06:33.300> me<00:06:33.890> just<00:06:34.890> it

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
moment um which kind of gives me just it

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.740 
moment um which kind of gives me just it
doesn't<00:06:35.220> quite<00:06:35.430> look<00:06:35.730> nice<00:06:36.120> I<00:06:36.360> kind<00:06:36.600> of<00:06:36.630> go

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
doesn't quite look nice I kind of go

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.999 
doesn't quite look nice I kind of go
have<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:36.960> keep<00:06:37.140> using<00:06:37.320> it<00:06:37.500> to<00:06:37.590> get<00:06:37.680> it<00:06:37.770> back

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
have to keep using it to get it back

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.189 
have to keep using it to get it back
into<00:06:38.279> that<00:06:38.430> shape<00:06:38.610> of<00:06:38.759> that<00:06:38.849> makes<00:06:39.089> sense<00:06:39.300> but

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
into that shape of that makes sense but

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.450 
into that shape of that makes sense but
I<00:06:40.259> have<00:06:40.439> been<00:06:40.559> thinking<00:06:40.680> about<00:06:40.860> getting<00:06:41.189> this

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460
