00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:05.459
 let's render the mixed numbers during a tense video a whole 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.289
 we transform them 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.779
 He remembered ceres 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.319
 sr 1 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:13.939
 7 3 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.199
 divided 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 4 for 1 4 and four plus 1 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.359
 now to stop 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.039
 all that direction according to the transformation 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.110
 multiplication by investing a scare the second fraction 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.430
 jessie 5 4th obama 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.120
 4 15 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 we do not check if there is something that we can simplify 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.290
 of cases no 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 and multiply number with -7 by 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.810
 28 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.450
 the one named with 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.450
 3 percent 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.450
 we are going to pray 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.750
 3 integers 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 divided 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 then the same as the previous case 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 the first mixed numbers three by three 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.850
 nine plus 2 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.980
 eleven 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.250
 divided 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800
 and we live that 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.790
 five strikeouts 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 eleven 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840
 we act together in the direction 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.650
 transforming it into a multiplication 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.430
 that is little and faction 11 15 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 we train in 5 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.840
 vivid 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.650
 others 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.370
 here we can simplify ponce no more than once once and finally we 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.230
 is then 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 3 for 1 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 4 divided 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.970
 three quarters 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.350
 now let's live a whole number 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.130
 by oneself 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 dk moment was not defined 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 in teruel if we transform 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.060
 Myth 4 for you 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.290
 eight more 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.540
 eleven 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.510
 vigo 4 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.159
 bingo more than four 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.579
 divided 1 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.129
 what fools of the holy ari commands the first in a 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.119
 multiplication 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.279
 11 4 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.279
 it will now correspond 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.569
 we do not have maracaibo Moscow 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.279
 the marker with the so-called 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.039
 so multiply 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.479
 16 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.479
 a dark 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.409
 the last division does not place the whole man 13 whole 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.019
 5 Sep 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.429
 divided 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.149
 two 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:44.569
 in all 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.569
 We transform this sign into exportable 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 18 plus 5 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.169
 and it's a whole video game 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.169
 although the whole world is divided 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.279
 and this has been the same in all 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.789
 2. 3 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.599
 multiplied by the fraction invest is true I lived one 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.039
 we have lived two 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.399
 there are no elements that we can simplify 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:22.309
 multiply 23 by one 23 and I followed by two
