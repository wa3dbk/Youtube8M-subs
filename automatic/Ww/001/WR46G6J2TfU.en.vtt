which<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.250> interesting<00:00:35.540> as<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
which this was an interesting as you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
which this was an interesting as you
change<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> first

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
change things so basically what I first

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.090 
change things so basically what I first
recommend<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> hydrogen

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
recommend is that you don't get hydrogen

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.030 
recommend is that you don't get hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:42.020> from<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.290> local<00:00:43.590> pharmacy

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
peroxide from your local pharmacy

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
peroxide from your local pharmacy
remember<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> stuff<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> stuff<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.420> bra

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
remember that stuff the stuff in bra

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619 
remember that stuff the stuff in bra
bottles<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.469> cosmic<00:00:46.770> oxide<00:00:47.629> has

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
bottles do get that cosmic oxide has

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
bottles do get that cosmic oxide has
preservatives<00:00:49.469> added<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.030> not

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
preservatives added to it so it's not

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
preservatives added to it so it's not
pure<00:00:51.510> hydrogen<00:00:51.930> peroxide<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.100> gonna

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
pure hydrogen peroxide so it's not gonna

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
pure hydrogen peroxide so it's not gonna
be<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.399> effective<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
be as effective and it's just the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
be as effective and it's just the
preservers<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.340> recommend<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
preservers I just don't recommend the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
preservers I just don't recommend the
concept<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.420> far<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> hydrogen

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
concept of so as far as the hydrogen

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.270 
concept of so as far as the hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:58.440> goes<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.649> don't<00:00:58.829> recommend<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
peroxide goes I don't recommend the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
peroxide goes I don't recommend the
brown<00:00:59.460> bottle<00:00:59.910> -<00:01:00.000> process<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> do

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
brown bottle - process what I do

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
brown bottle - process what I do
recommend<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.070> food<00:01:02.370> grade<00:01:02.399> hydrogen

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
recommend is food grade hydrogen

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.649 
recommend is food grade hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
peroxide which is this one right here is

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
peroxide which is this one right here is
as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.799> food<00:01:08.130> grade<00:01:08.659> 35

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
as you can see it's food grade 35

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
as you can see it's food grade 35
percent<00:01:10.409> hydrogen<00:01:10.979> peroxide<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
percent hydrogen peroxide and that is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
percent hydrogen peroxide and that is
really<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.540> high<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:17.729> says<00:01:18.000> caution<00:01:18.270> may

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
really really high it says caution may

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.370 
really really high it says caution may
cause<00:01:18.869> burns

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cause burns

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.249 
cause burns
they<00:01:20.040> aren't<00:01:20.220> joking<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.259> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
they aren't joking about that so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.149 
they aren't joking about that so
basically<00:01:23.570> what<00:01:24.570> love<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> uses<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.710> hydrogen

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
basically what love the uses of hydrogen

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300 
basically what love the uses of hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.150> purify<00:01:27.600> water<00:01:28.310> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
peroxide are like to purify water to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.600 
peroxide are like to purify water to

plants to neutralize call orders to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
neutralize pesticides things like I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.550 
neutralize pesticides things like I
actually<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:43.200> -<00:01:44.040> peroxide<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.229> spray

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
actually do have a - peroxide in a spray

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
actually do have a - peroxide in a spray
bottle<00:01:46.970> it's<00:01:47.970> diluted<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.780> bit<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
bottle it's diluted a little bit and I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
bottle it's diluted a little bit and I
sprayed<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.500> my<00:01:49.590> fruits<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.950> veggies<00:01:50.159> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sprayed that up my fruits and veggies on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
sprayed that up my fruits and veggies on
my<00:01:50.820> vegetables<00:01:51.180> every<00:01:51.360> once<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> while<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
my vegetables every once in a while so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.620 
my vegetables every once in a while so
once<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.470> are<00:01:52.500> organic

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
once they are organic

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.050 
once they are organic
to<00:01:54.290> neutralize<00:01:54.500> pesticides<00:01:55.159> which<00:01:55.909> that's

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
to neutralize pesticides which that's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.120 
to neutralize pesticides which that's
kind<00:01:56.329> of<00:01:56.360> cool<00:01:56.509> but<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.079> can<00:01:57.200> do<00:01:57.289> that<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:57.680> I'll

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
kind of cool but you can do that so I'll

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.429 
kind of cool but you can do that so I'll
basically<00:01:58.759> items<00:01:59.689> with<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.899> dropper<00:02:00.320> it

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
basically items with this dropper it

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.800 
basically items with this dropper it
here<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:01.000> what<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.240> do<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.630> you

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
here and what you can do is you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.090 
here and what you can do is you
basically<00:02:02.990> open<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.979> bottle<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.860> just

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
basically open the bottle and you just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.889 
basically open the bottle and you just
like<00:02:07.729> open<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.060> bottle<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.479> take<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.720> job

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
like open the bottle you take this job

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.779 
like open the bottle you take this job
that<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.110> put<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.130> why<00:02:10.250> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
that you put it in and this is why so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.479 
that you put it in and this is why so
this<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.000> what<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.180> recommend<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.599> do<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:11.900> well

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
this is what I recommend you do as well

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.520 
this is what I recommend you do as well
basically<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.180> don't<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:14.840> 35%

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
basically you don't want to use 35%

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.830 
basically you don't want to use 35%
because<00:02:15.800> basically<00:02:16.010> 35%<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:16.970> really<00:02:17.360> really<00:02:17.540> a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
because basically 35% is really really a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.620 
because basically 35% is really really a
high<00:02:18.140> level<00:02:18.349> hydrogen<00:02:18.739> peroxide<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> will

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
high level hydrogen peroxide and it will

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.140 
high level hydrogen peroxide and it will
cause<00:02:21.260> burns<00:02:21.680> like<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.069> burn<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:22.880> skin

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
cause burns like it will burn your skin

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.180 
cause burns like it will burn your skin
and<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.390> don't<00:02:23.540> mean<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.959> doesn't<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.319> it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and I don't mean it doesn't like it's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.920 
and I don't mean it doesn't like it's
not<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.489> third-degree<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.660> anything

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
not like a third-degree or anything

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.860 
not like a third-degree or anything
because<00:02:27.319> I've<00:02:27.560> used<00:02:28.010> 35%<00:02:28.760> before<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
because I've used 35% before but just to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
because I've used 35% before but just to
come<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.319> set<00:02:30.560> ups<00:02:30.709> I'm<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> mad<00:02:31.190> scientist

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
come to set ups I'm like a mad scientist

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.360 
come to set ups I'm like a mad scientist
put<00:02:31.970> okay<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.140> still<00:02:33.680> recommend<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.220> so

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
put okay I still recommend it so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.470 
put okay I still recommend it so
basically<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.239> explain<00:02:35.420> what

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
basically I just to explain what

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.820 
basically I just to explain what
hydrogen<00:02:35.840> peroxide<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.260> real<00:02:36.410> quick<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.590> so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
hydrogen peroxide is real quick just so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.430 
hydrogen peroxide is real quick just so
you<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.450> very<00:02:38.599> similar<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.260> water

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you know it's it's very similar to water

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.070 
you know it's it's very similar to water
water<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.950> h2o<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.330> believe<00:02:41.569> hydrogen

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
water is h2o and I believe hydrogen

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.089 
water is h2o and I believe hydrogen
peroxide<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.620> ho2<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:43.910> instead<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.829> two<00:02:45.829> parts

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
peroxide as ho2 so instead of two parts

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.610 
peroxide as ho2 so instead of two parts
hydrogen<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.579> part<00:02:46.790> oxygen<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.630> like<00:02:48.110> water

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
hydrogen one part oxygen like like water

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.610 
hydrogen one part oxygen like like water
is<00:02:49.239> hydrogen<00:02:50.239> peroxide<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:51.019> one<00:02:51.349> part

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
is hydrogen peroxide is one part

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.940 
is hydrogen peroxide is one part
hydrogen<00:02:52.099> two<00:02:52.370> parts<00:02:52.730> oxygen<00:02:53.530> two<00:02:54.530> months<00:02:54.860> of

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
hydrogen two parts oxygen two months of

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.650 
hydrogen two parts oxygen two months of
oxygen<00:02:55.489> molecules<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.390> little

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
oxygen molecules so it's just a little

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.630 
oxygen molecules so it's just a little
bit<00:02:56.750> different<00:02:57.079> than<00:02:57.560> water<00:02:57.950> itself<00:02:58.400> it's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
bit different than water itself it's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.729 
bit different than water itself it's
just<00:02:58.670> got<00:02:58.910> more<00:02:59.060> oxygen<00:02:59.630> picture<00:03:00.260> water<00:03:00.530> with

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
just got more oxygen picture water with

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.559 
just got more oxygen picture water with
more<00:03:00.890> oxygen<00:03:01.040> another<00:03:01.670> oxygen<00:03:01.910> molecule<00:03:02.510> in

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
more oxygen another oxygen molecule in

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.370 
more oxygen another oxygen molecule in
it<00:03:02.690> that's<00:03:03.230> -<00:03:03.440> peroxide<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.840> problem<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:06.260> it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
it that's - peroxide the problem with it

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.930 
it that's - peroxide the problem with it
is<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.560> chemical<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.040> risk<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:07.670> don't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
is a chemical and risk and you don't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.340 
is a chemical and risk and you don't
want<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.239> use<00:03:08.359> pretty<00:03:08.569> fun<00:03:08.720> percent<00:03:09.109> once

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
want to use pretty fun percent once

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.140 
want to use pretty fun percent once
again<00:03:09.650> also<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.519> don't<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.970> get<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
again also you don't want to get it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.400 
again also you don't want to get it
anywhere<00:03:11.569> in<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> region<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.170> your<00:03:12.290> eyes

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
anywhere in the region of your eyes

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.840 
anywhere in the region of your eyes
because<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:12.889> you<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.100> hives<00:03:13.250> from<00:03:13.370> proximity

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
because if you get hives from proximity

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.970 
because if you get hives from proximity
guys<00:03:13.940> especially<00:03:14.299> 35%<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.290> can<00:03:15.380> cause<00:03:15.560> big

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
guys especially 35% that can cause big

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.770 
guys especially 35% that can cause big
problems<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:17.120> I've<00:03:17.269> read<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.569> it<00:03:17.690> can

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
problems like I've read that it can

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.120 
problems like I've read that it can
cause<00:03:17.930> blindness<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.590> stuff<00:03:18.709> online<00:03:18.889> so

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
cause blindness and stuff online so

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.300 
cause blindness and stuff online so
don't<00:03:19.250> even<00:03:19.840> get<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.049> close<00:03:21.590> your<00:03:21.889> eyes<00:03:21.950> and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
don't even get this close your eyes and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.009 
don't even get this close your eyes and
I<00:03:22.549> have<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.120> funny<00:03:23.359> too<00:03:23.540> because<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.840> have

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
I have it's funny too because I have

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.740 
I have it's funny too because I have
used

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
used

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.270 
used
35%<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:26.900> did<00:03:27.109> did<00:03:27.470> not<00:03:27.620> know<00:03:27.739> about<00:03:27.889> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
35% when I did did not know about I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.530 
35% when I did did not know about I
think<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.609> should<00:03:28.760> be<00:03:28.910> as<00:03:29.000> devices<00:03:29.389> use

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
think you should be as devices use

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.150 
think you should be as devices use
there's<00:03:29.750> five<00:03:29.900> percent<00:03:30.290> like<00:03:30.530> because<00:03:31.040> I'm

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
there's five percent like because I'm

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.979 
there's five percent like because I'm
really<00:03:31.280> extreme<00:03:31.819> like<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.299> test<00:03:32.810> stuff<00:03:33.079> so

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
really extreme like I test stuff so

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.120 
really extreme like I test stuff so
basically<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.109> took<00:03:36.200> three<00:03:36.470> cups<00:03:36.650> I'll<00:03:36.799> put<00:03:37.040> it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
basically I took three cups I'll put it

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.370 
basically I took three cups I'll put it
like<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:38.180> little<00:03:38.450> blemishes<00:03:38.720> or<00:03:38.959> little

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
like I think little blemishes or little

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.500 
like I think little blemishes or little
things<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.769> my<00:03:39.859> Scotch<00:03:40.100> put<00:03:40.400> 35%<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.359> like

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
things on my Scotch put 35% and it like

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.509 
things on my Scotch put 35% and it like
foam<00:03:41.840> up<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.230> youthful<00:03:42.709> just<00:03:42.980> gonna<00:03:43.130> turns<00:03:43.370> it

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
foam up it youthful just gonna turns it

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.550 
foam up it youthful just gonna turns it
white<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.510> really<00:03:44.750> does<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> good<00:03:45.170> job<00:03:45.230> like

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
white but it really does a good job like

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.949 
white but it really does a good job like
getting<00:03:46.250> rid<00:03:46.459> of<00:03:46.489> those<00:03:46.700> things<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.690> put<00:03:47.900> it

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
getting rid of those things but I put it

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.690 
getting rid of those things but I put it
on<00:03:48.109> my<00:03:48.230> eye<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.440> like<00:03:48.980> one<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.280> eyes<00:03:49.459> was

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
on my eye and like one of my eyes was

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.949 
on my eye and like one of my eyes was
like<00:03:49.819> twitching<00:03:50.269> like<00:03:50.510> why<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.750> my<00:03:50.840> eye

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
like twitching like why is my eye

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.180 
like twitching like why is my eye
twitching<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.530> think<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.829> cuz<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.040> got<00:03:52.160> a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
twitching I think this cuz I got a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.580 
twitching I think this cuz I got a
little<00:03:52.430> hydrogen<00:03:52.639> peroxide<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.510> don't<00:03:53.900> use

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
little hydrogen peroxide so don't use

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.180 
little hydrogen peroxide so don't use
35%<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:55.549> here's<00:03:55.760> what<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.910> recommend<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.299> do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
35% so here's what I recommend you do

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.229 
35% so here's what I recommend you do
take<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.310> three<00:03:58.459> cups<00:03:58.730> then<00:03:58.880> take<00:03:59.120> the

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
take the three cups then take the

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.380 
take the three cups then take the
dropper<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.660> comes<00:03:59.959> with

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
dropper that comes with

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.090 
dropper that comes with
you<00:04:00.540> should<00:04:00.750> deprive<00:04:01.140> sickle<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.620> drop<00:04:01.830> if<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
you should deprive sickle and drop if it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.890 
you should deprive sickle and drop if it
doesn't<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> drop<00:04:03.300> of<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.450> bottle<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.840> this

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
doesn't get a drop of a bottle like this

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
doesn't get a drop of a bottle like this
one<00:04:04.320> here<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.730> why<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.880> take<00:04:06.330> about

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
one here and this is why I take about

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.160 
one here and this is why I take about
half<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.500> squirt<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.220> say<00:04:08.970> 15<00:04:09.450> 20<00:04:09.600> drops<00:04:09.960> of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
half a squirt so say 15 20 drops of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.070 
half a squirt so say 15 20 drops of
hydrogen<00:04:10.710> peroxide<00:04:10.970> 35%<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.540> put<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.900> into

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
hydrogen peroxide 35% and I put it into

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.560 
hydrogen peroxide 35% and I put it into
a<00:04:13.260> dropper<00:04:13.590> bottle<00:04:13.830> like<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.370> then<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.270> take

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
a dropper bottle like this then I take

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.470 
a dropper bottle like this then I take
this<00:04:15.750> dropper<00:04:16.170> bottle<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.680> add<00:04:17.299> spring<00:04:18.299> or

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
this dropper bottle and I add spring or

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240 
this dropper bottle and I add spring or
purified<00:04:18.870> water<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.560> rest<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.070> fill

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
purified water to the rest of it to fill

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.280 
purified water to the rest of it to fill
it<00:04:20.310> up<00:04:20.340> completely<00:04:20.690> what<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.840> does<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.109> the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
it up completely what that does is the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.500 
it up completely what that does is the
loose<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.920> 35%<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.940> about<00:04:24.120> 17%<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.550> takes<00:04:26.820> a

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
loose the 35% to about 17% so it takes a

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.860 
loose the 35% to about 17% so it takes a
good<00:04:28.350> trend<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.680> water<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.220> maybe<00:04:29.790> 10%<00:04:30.150> it's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
good trend of water and maybe 10% it's

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080 
good trend of water and maybe 10% it's
in<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.170> range<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.470> 10<00:04:31.680> 15<00:04:32.070> 17<00:04:32.669> percent<00:04:33.000> maybe

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
in the range of 10 15 17 percent maybe

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.250 
in the range of 10 15 17 percent maybe
twelve<00:04:33.360> thirteen<00:04:33.750> percent<00:04:33.840> hydrogen

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
twelve thirteen percent hydrogen

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.770 
twelve thirteen percent hydrogen
peroxide<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.910> basically<00:04:36.210> all<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.480> do<00:04:36.570> is<00:04:36.630> take

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
peroxide so basically all you do is take

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.750 
peroxide so basically all you do is take
that<00:04:36.810> 15<00:04:37.440> 20<00:04:37.800> square<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.310> will<00:04:38.370> put<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:38.700> a

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
that 15 20 square so this will put in a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.430 
that 15 20 square so this will put in a
dropper<00:04:39.030> bottle<00:04:39.150> fill<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.990> rest<00:04:40.110> with<00:04:40.200> water

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
dropper bottle fill the rest with water

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340 
dropper bottle fill the rest with water
and<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.950> actually<00:04:41.370> what<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.610> use<00:04:41.970> as<00:04:42.930> far

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
and this is actually what I use as far

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.680 
and this is actually what I use as far
as<00:04:44.060> doing<00:04:45.890> turntable<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.880> is<00:04:48.030> what<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.270> do<00:04:48.360> as

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
as doing turntable this is what I do as

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.240 
as doing turntable this is what I do as
far<00:04:48.930> as<00:04:49.220> creating<00:04:50.220> -<00:04:50.760> sighs<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:55.250> so

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
far as creating - sighs so so

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.000 
far as creating - sighs so so
basically<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.419> what<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.870> actually<00:04:58.169> use<00:04:58.680> so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
basically this is what I actually use so

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.850 
basically this is what I actually use so
I<00:04:59.040> take<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.340> put<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.120> here<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:01.169> taking

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
I take that put in here and this taking

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.980 
I take that put in here and this taking
a<00:05:01.919> dropper<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.880> clear<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.270> water<00:05:03.480> and

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
a dropper and it's clear like water and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.010 
a dropper and it's clear like water and
I'll<00:05:04.080> just<00:05:04.260> like<00:05:04.970> like<00:05:05.970> like<00:05:06.510> I'll<00:05:06.660> put<00:05:06.900> some

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
I'll just like like like I'll put some

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.120 
I'll just like like like I'll put some
on<00:05:07.110> my<00:05:07.260> finger<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.620> I'll<00:05:07.830> like<00:05:07.979> Reverend

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
Watts getting oil I go like this and I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.480 
Watts getting oil I go like this and I
put<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.050> my<00:05:10.140> skin<00:05:10.169> somewhere<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.010> then

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
put it on my skin somewhere and then

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.140 
put it on my skin somewhere and then
I'll<00:05:11.640> just<00:05:11.850> rub<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.750> into<00:05:12.870> wherever<00:05:14.150> whatever

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
I'll just rub it into wherever whatever

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.050 
I'll just rub it into wherever whatever
it<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:16.500> that's<00:05:16.680> that's<00:05:17.400> what<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.760> uh

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
it is so that's that's what I uh

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.750 
it is so that's that's what I uh
that's<00:05:18.720> what<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:18.870> used<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.169> do<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:20.310> every<00:05:20.550> once

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
that's what I used to do and every once

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.159 
that's what I used to do and every once
in<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:20.910> while<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.060> still<00:05:21.450> do<00:05:21.660> use<00:05:21.810> hydrogen

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
in a while I still do use hydrogen

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.469 
in a while I still do use hydrogen
peroxide<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:23.010> if<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.340> have<00:05:23.729> like<00:05:23.910> any<00:05:24.180> if<00:05:24.360> I

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
peroxide just if I have like any if I

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.500 
peroxide just if I have like any if I
feel<00:05:24.780> something<00:05:25.200> coming<00:05:25.380> at<00:05:25.710> my<00:05:25.860> skin<00:05:26.160> or

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
feel something coming at my skin or

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.210 
feel something coming at my skin or
having<00:05:27.510> a<00:05:27.600> little<00:05:27.840> blemish<00:05:28.560> or<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:29.130> know

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
having a little blemish or you know

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.200 
having a little blemish or you know
whatever<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.760> may<00:05:29.970> be

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
whatever it may be

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.880 
whatever it may be
Aya's<00:05:30.900> hydrogen<00:05:31.229> peroxide<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:31.650> kind<00:05:31.830> of

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
Aya's hydrogen peroxide it's kind of

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.200 
Aya's hydrogen peroxide it's kind of
good<00:05:32.040> for<00:05:32.070> neutralizing<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.850> because<00:05:33.120> it

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
good for neutralizing that because it

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.150 
good for neutralizing that because it
brings<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.479> oxygen<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.050> area<00:05:34.440> just<00:05:34.680> make

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
brings the oxygen to that area just make

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.409 
brings the oxygen to that area just make
sure<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.430> diluted<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.940> make<00:05:36.090> sure<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.300> keep

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
sure it's diluted and make sure to keep

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.210 
sure it's diluted and make sure to keep
away<00:05:36.570> from<00:05:36.600> out<00:05:36.840> it's<00:05:36.990> even<00:05:37.169> if<00:05:37.350> after<00:05:37.860> you

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
away from out it's even if after you

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.130 
away from out it's even if after you
glue<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:38.490> it's<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:38.790> 15<00:05:39.570> percent<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:39.930> whatever

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
glue it it's like 15 percent or whatever

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.469 
glue it it's like 15 percent or whatever
it<00:05:40.290> says<00:05:40.820> still<00:05:41.820> keep<00:05:42.000> away<00:05:42.120> from<00:05:42.150> your<00:05:42.419> eyes

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
it says still keep away from your eyes

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.600 
it says still keep away from your eyes
because<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.870> shouldn't<00:05:43.020> get<00:05:43.140> into<00:05:43.290> eyes<00:05:43.610> and

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
because it shouldn't get into eyes and

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.100 
because it shouldn't get into eyes and
it's<00:05:44.880> just<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.419> just<00:05:45.450> not<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.720> good<00:05:45.810> idea<00:05:46.050> to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
it's just it's just not a good idea to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.890 
it's just it's just not a good idea to
get<00:05:46.229> your<00:05:46.320> eyes<00:05:46.470> so<00:05:47.150> yeah<00:05:48.150> it's<00:05:48.540> perfect<00:05:48.720> a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
get your eyes so yeah it's perfect a

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.710 
get your eyes so yeah it's perfect a
dropper<00:05:49.200> bottle<00:05:49.290> will<00:05:49.530> seem<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.770> win<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.070> with

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
dropper bottle will seem to win it with

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.960 
dropper bottle will seem to win it with
good<00:05:50.960> hydroxide<00:05:51.590> just<00:05:52.220> drop<00:05:52.400> it<00:05:52.520> on<00:05:52.550> your<00:05:52.760> skin

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
good hydroxide just drop it on your skin

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.930 
good hydroxide just drop it on your skin
and<00:05:53.180> wash<00:05:53.420> your<00:05:53.570> face<00:05:53.720> before<00:05:54.430> then<00:05:55.430> drop<00:05:55.790> it

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
and wash your face before then drop it

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.280 
and wash your face before then drop it
onto<00:05:56.060> those<00:05:56.240> serious<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.660> your<00:05:56.750> skin<00:05:56.960> let<00:05:57.170> it

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
onto those serious and your skin let it

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.720 
onto those serious and your skin let it
sit<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:58.040> might<00:05:58.160> turn<00:05:58.280> a<00:05:58.340> little<00:05:58.610> white

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
sit and it might turn a little white

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.460 
sit and it might turn a little white
foamy<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.210> that's<00:05:59.510> just<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.780> oxygen<00:05:59.990> getting

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
foamy and that's just the oxygen getting

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.610 
foamy and that's just the oxygen getting
into<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.740> skin<00:06:00.950> really<00:06:02.350> getting<00:06:03.350> into<00:06:03.560> that

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
into the skin really getting into that

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.200 
into the skin really getting into that
area<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.220> really<00:06:04.610> think<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:04.940> does<00:06:05.030> a<00:06:05.060> good

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
area and I really think it does a good

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.240 
area and I really think it does a good
job<00:06:05.270> like<00:06:05.660> killing<00:06:05.990> bacteria<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.860> getting

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
job like killing bacteria and getting

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.860 
job like killing bacteria and getting
oxygen<00:06:07.730> inside<00:06:08.060> it<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.480> if<00:06:08.540> you<00:06:08.630> do<00:06:08.750> have

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
oxygen inside it so if you do have

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.610 
oxygen inside it so if you do have
pimples<00:06:09.200> or<00:06:09.290> acne<00:06:09.730> this<00:06:10.730> is<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:10.940> good<00:06:11.150> way<00:06:11.300> to

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
pimples or acne this is a good way to

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.720 
pimples or acne this is a good way to
you<00:06:12.620> know<00:06:12.680> trust<00:06:12.920> a<00:06:13.010> little<00:06:13.160> but<00:06:13.370> like<00:06:13.460> once

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
you know trust a little but like once

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.580 
you know trust a little but like once
again<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:14.030> highly<00:06:14.840> recommend<00:06:15.200> keep<00:06:15.380> me<00:06:15.440> away

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
again I highly recommend keep me away

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.830 
again I highly recommend keep me away
from<00:06:15.620> my<00:06:15.800> eyes<00:06:15.980> and<00:06:16.280> diluting<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.450> 15

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
from my eyes and diluting it to 15

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.930 
from my eyes and diluting it to 15
percent<00:06:18.200> of<00:06:18.260> our<00:06:18.410> or<00:06:18.740> whatever<00:06:19.070> this<00:06:19.580> is<00:06:19.730> maybe

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
percent of our or whatever this is maybe

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.360 
percent of our or whatever this is maybe
ten<00:06:20.210> percent<00:06:20.570> and<00:06:21.530> you<00:06:21.650> can<00:06:21.800> even<00:06:21.950> do<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.190> math

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
ten percent and you can even do the math

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.220 
ten percent and you can even do the math
because<00:06:22.670> this<00:06:22.790> is<00:06:22.910> 35<00:06:23.270> percent<00:06:23.360> food<00:06:23.990> great

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
because this is 35 percent food great

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.470 
because this is 35 percent food great
husband<00:06:24.590> oxide<00:06:24.950> so<00:06:25.430> if<00:06:25.520> I<00:06:25.580> took<00:06:25.640> like<00:06:25.880> 15<00:06:26.060> drops

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
husband oxide so if I took like 15 drops

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.880 
husband oxide so if I took like 15 drops
of<00:06:26.570> that<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:26.900> put<00:06:27.080> 30<00:06:27.320> drops<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.740> water

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
of that and I put 30 drops of water

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.240 
of that and I put 30 drops of water
there'd<00:06:28.250> be<00:06:28.340> like<00:06:28.460> a<00:06:28.520> custom<00:06:29.320> calculation<00:06:30.320> you

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
there'd be like a custom calculation you

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.620 
there'd be like a custom calculation you
can<00:06:31.400> figure<00:06:31.550> out<00:06:31.640> the<00:06:31.790> actual<00:06:31.940> percentage<00:06:32.420> so

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
can figure out the actual percentage so

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.180 
can figure out the actual percentage so
you<00:06:32.720> can<00:06:32.900> do<00:06:32.990> that<00:06:33.140> if<00:06:33.230> you<00:06:33.290> want<00:06:33.530> which<00:06:33.770> you

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
you can do that if you want which you

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.810 
you can do that if you want which you
know<00:06:34.340> it's<00:06:34.970> up<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.240> you<00:06:35.330> but<00:06:36.700> that's<00:06:37.700> pretty

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
know it's up to you but that's pretty

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.430 
know it's up to you but that's pretty
much<00:06:37.940> it<00:06:38.060> for<00:06:38.090> this<00:06:38.270> video<00:06:38.390> but<00:06:38.720> just<00:06:38.900> to

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
much it for this video but just to

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.230 
much it for this video but just to
emphasize<00:06:39.470> this<00:06:40.250> can<00:06:40.610> be<00:06:40.850> dangerous

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
emphasize this can be dangerous

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.900 
emphasize this can be dangerous
is<00:06:41.660> there<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:41.840> 5%<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:43.460> you<00:06:43.550> don't<00:06:43.669> want<00:06:43.790> to<00:06:43.850> get

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
is there a 5% and you don't want to get

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.570 
is there a 5% and you don't want to get
your<00:06:44.060> eyes<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.950> once<00:06:45.950> again<00:06:46.070> it's<00:06:46.370> just<00:06:46.400> a

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
your eyes and once again it's just a

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.950
