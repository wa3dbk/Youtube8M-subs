00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.970

 Wow, they are also in English there on 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:12.750
 let 's figure it out so yusbi transition for 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.709
 charging the charging itself no adapter 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:21.870
 that there from external devices is permissible with

 phone or tablet and pic mp3 player 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.120
 although such a meaning can be up to the computer 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.290
 connect so we â€™d continue the battery 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 now turned on the camera from the network for 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:39.150
 netbook laptop can be so different to me 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:43.620
 the question interests if there is an exit on 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:49.100
 headphones means that the sound is stereo or 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:54.410
