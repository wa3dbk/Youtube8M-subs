rice I only added three three is enough

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.509 
rice I only added three three is enough
I<00:03:08.480> forgot<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.230> once<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.680> make<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.250> beans

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
I forgot that once you make the beans

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.819 
I forgot that once you make the beans
you<00:03:11.180> don't<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.049> add<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.200> much<00:03:12.560> rice

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
you don't have to add that much rice

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.250 
you don't have to add that much rice
because<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.370> takes<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.819> lot<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.000> space<00:03:14.329> as<00:03:15.049> you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
because it takes a lot of space as you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.140 
because it takes a lot of space as you
can<00:03:15.319> see<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.549> good<00:03:16.730> with<00:03:16.910> water
