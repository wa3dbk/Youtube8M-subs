00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
is the I our flight deck and the iphone

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.560 
is the I our flight deck and the iphone
app<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.880> show<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.330> few

app and we're going to show you a few

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.240 
app and we're going to show you a few
seconds<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.530> helicopter<00:00:10.710> actually

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
seconds of the helicopter actually

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.570 
seconds of the helicopter actually
flying<00:00:11.519> after<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.049> deck<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.580> fairly

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
flying after this so the deck is fairly

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.990 
flying after this so the deck is fairly
clunky<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.199> molded<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.310> sway<00:00:17.699> that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
clunky but it is molded in a sway that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.140 
clunky but it is molded in a sway that
it<00:00:18.240> feels<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.230> nice<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.010> hand<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.880> it's

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it feels really nice in hand but it's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.380 
it feels really nice in hand but it's
still<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:22.080> clunky<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:23.189> uses<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:24.029> triple

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
still really clunky it uses for triple

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.560 
still really clunky it uses for triple
a's<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.880> on<00:00:26.880> your<00:00:27.240> own<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a's which you have to get on your own it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
a's which you have to get on your own it
doesn't<00:00:27.869> come<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:29.160> you've<00:00:29.519> got

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
doesn't come with it and then you've got

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
doesn't come with it and then you've got
the<00:00:29.849> ir<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> front<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.410> really

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the ir on the front and this really

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
the ir on the front and this really
easily<00:00:32.309> slips<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.270> had<00:00:33.390> no<00:00:33.600> problem

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
easily slips on we had no problem

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
easily slips on we had no problem
getting<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.739> our<00:00:34.860> ipod<00:00:35.219> too<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> case

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
getting it on our ipod too with a case

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.479 
getting it on our ipod too with a case
an<00:00:36.329> Oklahoman<00:00:36.750> getting<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.320> 3gs<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
an Oklahoman getting it on this 3gs with

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
an Oklahoman getting it on this 3gs with
a<00:00:38.520> case<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.090> it'll<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.510> fit<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
a case so it'll really fit well you can

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.520 
a case so it'll really fit well you can
also<00:00:40.920> take<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> cable<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> run<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> through

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
also take the cable and run it through

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.549 
also take the cable and run it through
to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> audio<00:00:44.430> jack<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> audio<00:00:46.050> jack<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to the audio jack so the audio jack is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.860 
to the audio jack so the audio jack is
there<00:00:46.800> because<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.700> sends<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
there because this actually sends the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
there because this actually sends the
initial<00:00:49.289> signal<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.920> audio<00:00:50.160> which<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
initial signal through audio which then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.170 
initial signal through audio which then
goes<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.480> ir<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.260> hit<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.770> there

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
goes to the ir so if I hit this up there

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
goes to the ir so if I hit this up there
you're<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.449> annoying<00:00:54.750> noise<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.829> when

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you're really annoying noise but when

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.229 
you're really annoying noise but when
you're<00:00:56.280> using<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:56.850> hear<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you're using it you don't hear that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
you're using it you don't hear that
because<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.750> coming<00:00:58.170> through<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> cable<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
because it's coming through the cable so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.639 
because it's coming through the cable so
controls<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.359> real<00:01:00.510> simple<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.170> got<00:01:01.379> your

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
controls are real simple you got your

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
controls are real simple you got your
throttle<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> left<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:03.359> you've<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
throttle on the left then you've got a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
throttle on the left then you've got a
joystick<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> trim<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
joystick on the right and trim so the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.609 
joystick on the right and trim so the
helicopter<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> left<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
helicopter is going to the left of the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
helicopter is going to the left of the
right<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> try<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> adjust<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.939> with

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
right you can try to adjust that with

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840 
right you can try to adjust that with
that<00:01:09.360> although<00:01:10.110> after<00:01:10.350> numerous<00:01:11.100> crashes<00:01:11.460> we

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that although after numerous crashes we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
that although after numerous crashes we
found<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> wasn't<00:01:12.720> working<00:01:12.840> anymore<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
found that it wasn't working anymore you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
found that it wasn't working anymore you
can<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.890> set<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.939> motion<00:01:15.390> controls

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
can also set this to use motion controls

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
can also set this to use motion controls
if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> want<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.369> you've<00:01:17.670> got

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
if you want then over here you've got

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.179 
if you want then over here you've got
flight<00:01:18.090> plans<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.930> record<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> 20

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
flight plans you can record up to 20

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
flight plans you can record up to 20
seconds<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> flight<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.450> play<00:01:21.960> back

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
seconds of flight and it will play back

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
seconds of flight and it will play back
what<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> recorded<00:01:22.950> although<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.970> couldn't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
what you recorded although we couldn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.570 
what you recorded although we couldn't
get<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> long<00:01:25.170> enough<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.830> test<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
get it long enough to really test that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.999 
get it long enough to really test that
out<00:01:26.659> there's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.780> button<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> bottom<00:01:28.650> here
