00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.990
 drags into reality and I made the book of the carts together with bass herring 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.889
 the book will go to the printer tomorrow and I will also go on maternity leave tomorrow 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.649
 that is by the time the book is in store, I am very different things 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.999
 doing I want to explain a little bit why I have such a great book 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.499
 Become of the Kraats is an anthology of texts that are on the one or 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.259
 explain science very well to fall into carcela 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.789
 there looked at ways you can explain science to alone 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.419
 know it 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.970
 we have the gorinchem chapters that are similar in the way 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.260
 explanation use the first chapters 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.400
 especially for forest full of other groups 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.320
 in it, physics is explained on the basis of stories about hairdressers 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.830
 or shopping streets and also an entire chapter which I also very much 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.500
 finds beautiful stories that preses his thoughts that describes how scientists 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.940
 really 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.579
 come to discover step by step and it says how llorens 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580
 has discovered chaos theory 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.540
 and otherwise I was completely full of experiments 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.090
 and before that she hates experiments and never hates them 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.790
 third team test you like very much then thought I would not let the chance 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.130
 grabs to show a sample in this video which I really like 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.830
 not only but you will get there 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 and a box of matches 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.590
 light the candles 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.550
 wait until that group burns 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.810
 the national cannot take the burning cigar from the top to the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 plans 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 you see 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.270
 that the map will light up again for the symmetrical far both countries 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.980
 arrived 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.670
 maikel further expanded you can taste all your 18h30 to see a children how far 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 cool science can be 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.760
 and charles dickens lies continued 18 50 times fiction story about writing 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.990
 doing training tells cuisiniers more of fernandez visited 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.980
 and how he became enthusiastic about what he saw 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 however, the young wants to look forward 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.210
 the visor of which takes off from the land I am holding a burning piece of paper in the smoke 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.130
 to touch without land 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.300
 but looks the candle is going to burn 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.330
 this shows that trapped wax trapped by the wick is converted into vapors 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.089
 and that it then burns 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.819
 it's after seeing a manhunt and you get that little bit of explanation 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.219
 actually not someone who burns the candle but the vapor that surrounds it 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.039
 depends 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.339
 and they already did that in 38
