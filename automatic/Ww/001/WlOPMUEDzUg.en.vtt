00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
have a nice believe is stored it could

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.570 
have a nice believe is stored it could
be<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.240> nice<00:05:25.450> one<00:05:25.660> long<00:05:25.840> history<00:05:26.470> there's<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.550> lot

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
be a nice one long history there's a lot

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.870 
be a nice one long history there's a lot
of<00:05:27.850> choices<00:05:28.210> here<00:05:28.420> I<00:05:28.810> know<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.740> high<00:05:30.370> towers

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
of choices here I know the high towers

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.360 
of choices here I know the high towers
are<00:05:31.000> always<00:05:31.240> quite<00:05:31.450> popular<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.710> man<00:05:33.010> delays

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
are always quite popular the man delays

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.000 
are always quite popular the man delays
are<00:05:33.730> normally<00:05:34.540> a<00:05:34.570> popular<00:05:35.050> choice<00:05:35.260> I'm

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
are normally a popular choice I'm

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.290 
are normally a popular choice I'm
probably<00:05:36.250> gonna<00:05:36.460> stay<00:05:36.670> at<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.820> North<00:05:37.090> the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
probably gonna stay at the North the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.030 
probably gonna stay at the North the
north<00:05:37.570> is<00:05:37.780> probably<00:05:38.080> not<00:05:38.230> a<00:05:38.290> choice<00:05:38.620> because<00:05:39.010> I

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
north is probably not a choice because I

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.160 
north is probably not a choice because I
got<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.250> Forester<00:05:39.760> let's<00:05:39.970> play<00:05:40.210> so<00:05:40.780> probably

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
got the Forester let's play so probably

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.290 
got the Forester let's play so probably
won't<00:05:41.380> be<00:05:41.470> playing<00:05:41.680> there<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:43.000> probably

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
won't be playing there and I probably

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.240 
won't be playing there and I probably
won't<00:05:43.510> try<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.810> form<00:05:44.140> new<00:05:44.200> Valyria<00:05:44.860> cuz<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.100> just

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
won't try to form new Valyria cuz I just

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.680 
won't try to form new Valyria cuz I just
had<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.370> last<00:05:45.670> series<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.150> don't<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.450> do<00:05:46.570> it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
again maybe in the future we'll try

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.640 
again maybe in the future we'll try
something<00:05:49.450> where<00:05:49.690> we'd<00:05:49.780> form<00:05:50.020> new<00:05:50.170> Valyria

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
something where we'd form new Valyria

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.820 
something where we'd form new Valyria
