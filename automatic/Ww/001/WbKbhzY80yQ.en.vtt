someone<00:02:05.159> who<00:02:05.430> spilled<00:02:05.939> over<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.540> working

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
someone who spilled over that's working

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.400 
someone who spilled over that's working
above<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.799> forth<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:09.140> creates<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
above you and so forth that creates that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.530 
above you and so forth that creates that
for<00:02:10.679> dollar<00:02:10.830> check<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:11.970> important<00:02:12.420> one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
for dollar check the more important one

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
for dollar check the more important one
is<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> bring<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.349> someone

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is if you bring in someone

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
is if you bring in someone
when<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> can<00:02:14.190> earn<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.580> sixteen<00:02:15.480> dollars

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
when you can earn up to sixteen dollars

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.280 
when you can earn up to sixteen dollars
which<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> pretty<00:02:17.040> nice<00:02:17.280> fast<00:02:17.730> start<00:02:18.290> based

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
which is a pretty nice fast start based

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
which is a pretty nice fast start based
on<00:02:19.470> our<00:02:20.330> 4995<00:02:21.560> offer<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.190> slim<00:02:23.430> berry<00:02:23.640> on

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
on our 4995 offer of the slim berry on

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.890 
on our 4995 offer of the slim berry on
the<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.140> 40<00:02:25.500> bv<00:02:26.120> which<00:02:27.120> creates<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the so you have 40 bv which creates the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.670 
the so you have 40 bv which creates the
one<00:02:28.290> bottle<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.280> slim<00:02:29.640> berry<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.600> one<00:02:31.320> order

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
one bottle of slim berry for one order

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.470 
one bottle of slim berry for one order
clearly<00:02:32.070> someone<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.820> order<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.330> than

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
clearly someone can have order more than

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
clearly someone can have order more than
that<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.840> create<00:02:34.110> more<00:02:34.140> BB<00:02:34.770> or<00:02:35.340> CV<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.890> we'll

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
that and create more BB or CV but we'll

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.710 
that and create more BB or CV but we'll
just<00:02:38.040> go<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.490> least<00:02:39.000> amount<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.570> this

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
just go with the least amount in this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290 
just go with the least amount in this
example<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.430> other<00:02:41.550> way<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.030> team

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
example so the other way is the team

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.890 
example so the other way is the team
cycle<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.900> residual

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
cycle this is really is the residual

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.370 
cycle this is really is the residual
reoccurring<00:02:46.890> weekly<00:02:47.430> income<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:49.080> come

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
reoccurring weekly income that can come

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080 
reoccurring weekly income that can come
from<00:02:49.410> your<00:02:49.830> business<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.850> want

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
from your business that you really want

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.380 
from your business that you really want
to<00:02:51.720> build<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.940> really<00:02:54.090> start

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
to build on and this can really start

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.840 
to build on and this can really start
leveraging<00:02:54.900> your<00:02:55.200> income<00:02:55.800> through<00:02:56.400> other

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
leveraging your income through other

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.650 
leveraging your income through other
people<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.080> once<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> bring<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.100> personally

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
people so once you bring I personally

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.449 
people so once you bring I personally
sponsored<00:03:00.660> person<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.200> your<00:03:01.320> left<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.800> one<00:03:02.430> on

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
sponsored person on your left and one on

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.720 
sponsored person on your left and one on
your<00:03:02.820> right<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.070> point<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
your right then it at that point it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.280 
your right then it at that point it
doesn't<00:03:06.239> matter<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.870> people<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.260> your

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
doesn't matter the people in your

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
doesn't matter the people in your
business<00:03:07.560> necessarily<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:09.390> really

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
business necessarily it's really

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.110 
business necessarily it's really
checking<00:03:10.050> on<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.650> volume<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.400> your<00:03:11.880> business

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
checking on the volume in your business

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.470 
checking on the volume in your business
so<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.530> 80<00:03:13.830> in<00:03:14.160> volume<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.239> side

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
so if you have 80 in volume on one side

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.580 
so if you have 80 in volume on one side
and<00:03:15.510> 40<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.680> other<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.810> urn<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and 40 on the other in that urn that's a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.610 
and 40 on the other in that urn that's a
one<00:03:19.950> cycle<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.850> business<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.110> can

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
one cycle in the business so you can

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.069 
one cycle in the business so you can
divide<00:03:22.980> up<00:03:23.160> all<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:25.820> volume<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.329> leg<00:03:27.630> and

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
divide up all the volume on one leg and

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.560 
divide up all the volume on one leg and
that's<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.070> your<00:03:29.280> power<00:03:29.820> leg<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
that's going to be your power leg and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.900 
that's going to be your power leg and
then<00:03:31.019> by<00:03:31.290> 80<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:32.430> divide<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.790> other

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
then by 80 and then divide the other

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.140 
then by 80 and then divide the other
side<00:03:33.150> by<00:03:33.299> 40<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.350> number<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.890> times<00:03:35.100> 40<00:03:35.850> will

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
side by 40 the number of times 40 will

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.870 
side by 40 the number of times 40 will
go<00:03:36.299> into<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:37.079> will<00:03:37.410> equal<00:03:37.829> six<00:03:38.459> dollars<00:03:38.850> per

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
go into that will equal six dollars per

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.740 
go into that will equal six dollars per
time<00:03:39.390> six<00:03:39.930> dollars<00:03:40.890> in<00:03:41.130> commissions<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.269> for

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
time six dollars in commissions so for

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.410 
time six dollars in commissions so for
example<00:03:42.840> down<00:03:43.380> here<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.799> had<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> 240<00:03:44.850> volume<00:03:45.239> on

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
example down here we had a 240 volume on

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.340 
example down here we had a 240 volume on
your<00:03:45.480> left<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:47.420> 320<00:03:48.420> volume<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:48.989> your<00:03:49.019> right

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
your left and 320 volume on your right

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.539 
your left and 320 volume on your right
and<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.459> created<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.150> $24<00:03:52.280> commission<00:03:53.280> check

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
and that created a $24 commission check

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.150 
and that created a $24 commission check
based<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.720> also<00:03:54.900> carries<00:03:55.380> over<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
based on that it also carries over so it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.789 
based on that it also carries over so it
says<00:03:56.340> no<00:03:56.670> flushing<00:03:57.540> what<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.440> simply<00:03:58.650> means

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
says no flushing what that simply means

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.039 
says no flushing what that simply means
is<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> volume<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.850> isn't<00:04:00.209> used<00:04:00.630> that

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
is the volume it isn't used that

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.020 
is the volume it isn't used that
particular<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.709> week<00:04:01.890> will<00:04:02.489> carry<00:04:02.910> over

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
particular of the week will carry over

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.860 
particular of the week will carry over
