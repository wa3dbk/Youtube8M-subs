 good and tonight in seven stars 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 let's know the names of the 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.629
 Costa Rican personalities who 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.869
 will participate in the next program 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:22.380
 face sounds to me however we 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:25.100
 we rob one of them in these images 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.100
 please 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.130

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:39.040
 [Music] 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:44.770
 but I have the singers to know what 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.170
 tunnel or a scale what I have and I 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.610
 same with leather these works is part of 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.420
 what they are going to have to do 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.310
 because we already have here in the house of 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:07.140
 buendÃ­a we also have here at home as well 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:07.140
 that the truth 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 thank you very much for the invitation 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 is to look at a few hours of knowing who 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 are the other contestants that are going to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.619
 be in the new teletica format you 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.539
 hot 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.350
 but of course it's kind of 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.960
 good food at the beginning a lot 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 emotion I liked the idea from the first 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.350
 moment they told me about and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.630
 he started working a little bit before 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.159
 of the casting in that in the characters and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.869
 good part of the show I do with the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.509
 iron touches me like imitating accents 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.069
 then to play also but yes 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.950
 discovering very small that I do not 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.360
 it costs to imitate accents 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.640
 you're going to have to take out the part 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.880
 histrionic at the time also not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.579
 is only singing but also 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.590
 interpret and characterize with 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.149
 singer that you're going to think to the bronx and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.429
 I think that part is not that difficult what 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:13.610
 what scares me the most is the part of the dance 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:16.819
 because I'm like that the taste and thanks to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.590
 god because if it is not dances but I know 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.540
 was practicing then yes yes already 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.799
 I can be more or less you know who they are 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.150
 those who are going to touch you we know that 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.579
 we can not advance too much 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 information but yes I already know what 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.660
 are 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.510
 many surprises because farmers of a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.459
 thing if I can do more or less the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.650
 ridiculous as chayanne thanks to 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.540

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.970

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.550

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.470
 let's do one thing I invite Cesc and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.769

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.740
 only two to the comparisons but I have 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.380
 my reasons for knowing that it was a mistake 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.440
 I put in the balance what I have and I 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.680
 I restrain myself from singing you my 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.719

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.110
