you see it's got like 3d ice graphics
which<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:31.949> nice<00:00:32.270> see<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.420> power-ups

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
which are really nice see what power-ups

destructor there's no indestructible

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.940 
destructor there's no indestructible
block<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:46.960> there<00:02:47.080> are<00:02:47.140> exactly<00:02:47.320> blocks<00:02:47.710> like

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
block so there are exactly blocks like

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.250
