want<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.010> saturate<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.640> paper<00:00:42.409> which<00:00:43.409> means

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
want to saturate the paper which means

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.180 
want to saturate the paper which means
making<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.400> really<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.120> wet<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.949> that<00:00:46.979> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
making it really really wet so that it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.890 
making it really really wet so that it
soaks<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.580> as<00:00:47.760> much<00:00:47.909> ink<00:00:48.150> as<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
soaks up as much ink as it can and you

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.600 
soaks up as much ink as it can and you
want<00:00:49.080> to<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> by<00:00:49.589> coloring<00:00:50.040> in<00:00:50.190> little

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
want to do this by coloring in little

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.299 
want to do this by coloring in little
areas<00:00:50.790> at<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.330> time<00:00:51.650> like<00:00:52.650> I'm<00:00:52.799> just<00:00:53.100> doing

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
areas at a time like I'm just doing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:14.920 
areas at a time like I'm just doing
little<00:00:53.610> circles<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.089> this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.280 

and<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.980> trick<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:17.390> color<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.900> small

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
and the trick is to color in small

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.960 
and the trick is to color in small
sections<00:01:18.680> at<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.800> time<00:01:18.890> notice<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.520> colored<00:01:19.790> down

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
sections at a time notice I colored down

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.060 
sections at a time notice I colored down
here<00:01:20.240> first<00:01:20.510> then<00:01:20.900> here<00:01:21.290> then<00:01:21.470> here<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.950> I'm

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
here first then here then here and I'm

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.510 
here first then here then here and I'm
moving<00:01:22.280> my<00:01:22.640> way<00:01:23.380> moving<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.250> next

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
moving my way moving on to the next

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.610 
moving my way moving on to the next
section<00:01:25.730> one<00:01:26.060> at<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.240> time<00:01:26.480> because<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.380> don't

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
want the color to dry in the area that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.690 
want the color to dry in the area that
you're<00:01:29.960> coloring<00:01:30.440> see<00:01:31.220> how<00:01:31.340> I'm<00:01:31.460> kind<00:01:31.520> of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
coming sort of from above a bit so I'm

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.889 
coming sort of from above a bit so I'm
going<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.740> shade<00:02:00.980> underneath<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.970> bow<00:02:02.180> here

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899

then right away once you shade one

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.130 
then right away once you shade one
section<00:02:13.610> go<00:02:14.210> back<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.600> blend<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.990> with<00:02:15.020> your

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
section go back and blend it with your

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.820 
section go back and blend it with your
lighter<00:02:15.410> color<00:02:17.350> especially<00:02:18.350> if<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> colors

lighter color especially if the colors
you're<00:02:18.950> using<00:02:19.100> aren't<00:02:19.489> really<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.120> similar

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
you're using aren't really that similar

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.750 
you're using aren't really that similar
like<00:02:20.720> mine<00:02:20.959> they<00:02:21.290> only<00:02:21.440> differ<00:02:21.739> by<00:02:21.860> two<00:02:22.040> digits

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
like mine they only differ by two digits

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.790 
like mine they only differ by two digits
it's<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.450> twenty<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.989> twenty<00:02:24.350> two<00:02:24.560> but

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
it's a twenty and a twenty two but

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.610 
it's a twenty and a twenty two but
they're<00:02:24.950> still<00:02:25.160> quite<00:02:25.489> different<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.620> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
they're still quite different so you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.140 
they're still quite different so you
want<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.860> blend<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.310> as<00:02:28.580> quickly<00:02:28.880> as<00:02:29.120> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
want to blend that out as quickly as you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.150 
want to blend that out as quickly as you
can

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
can

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.440 
can
and<00:02:31.160> if<00:02:31.550> you're<00:02:31.700> using<00:02:31.880> really<00:02:32.120> similar

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
and if you're using really similar

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.970 
and if you're using really similar
colors<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:32.989> if<00:02:33.110> you're<00:02:33.230> using<00:02:33.380> our<00:02:33.530> 20<00:02:33.890> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
colors like if you're using our 20 and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.710 
colors like if you're using our 20 and
our<00:02:34.040> twenty<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:35.120> might<00:02:35.360> not<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
our twenty one you might not see the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.060 
our twenty one you might not see the
shading<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.320> much<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.739> might<00:02:36.860> want<00:02:37.010> to

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
shading that much so you might want to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.470 
shading that much so you might want to
go<00:02:37.160> back<00:02:37.190> with<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:37.670> dark<00:02:37.940> color<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.390> then

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
go back with your dark color and then

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.090 
go back with your dark color and then
shade<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.930> again<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.940> now<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.690> am<00:02:45.080> moving<00:02:45.350> on<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
shade it again so now I am moving on to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.720 
shade it again so now I am moving on to
shading<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:46.640> area<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:48.310> getting<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.370> bit<00:02:49.580> of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
shading this area just getting a bit of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.260 
shading this area just getting a bit of
shading<00:02:50.209> underneath<00:02:52.120> bit<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.420> crease

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
shading underneath bit in that crease

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.340 
shading underneath bit in that crease
and<00:02:56.270> then<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.720> where<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.959> ribbon<00:02:57.200> is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
and then this is where the ribbon is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.979 
and then this is where the ribbon is
folding<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.269> front<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.690> ribbon<00:02:59.900> is

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
folding so the front of the ribbon is

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.509 
folding so the front of the ribbon is
casting<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> shadow<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.010> back<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
casting a shadow on the back of the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.170 
casting a shadow on the back of the
ribbon<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.800> then<00:03:06.860> these<00:03:07.100> creases<00:03:07.459> here<00:03:07.610> will

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
ribbon and then these creases here will

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.550 
ribbon and then these creases here will
get<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> bit<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.660> shading

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080 

pretty<00:03:12.160> much<00:03:12.250> anywhere<00:03:12.610> there's<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.849> crease

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
pretty much anywhere there's a crease

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.520 
pretty much anywhere there's a crease
you'll<00:03:13.420> watch<00:03:13.599> treating<00:03:16.080> now<00:03:17.080> going<00:03:17.349> back

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you'll watch treating now going back

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.570 
you'll watch treating now going back
with<00:03:17.709> my<00:03:17.860> lighter<00:03:18.069> color<00:03:18.370> again<00:03:20.459> blending<00:03:21.459> it

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
with my lighter color again blending it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:46.729 
with my lighter color again blending it
out

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.890 

and<00:03:47.739> then<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.430> keep<00:03:48.730> blending<00:03:49.209> until<00:03:49.510> you're

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and then just keep blending until you're

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.920 
and then just keep blending until you're
happy<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.590> level<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:50.980> blending<00:03:51.930> some

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
happy with the level of blending some

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.449 
happy with the level of blending some
people<00:03:53.260> don't<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.739> shading<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.159> be<00:03:54.280> too

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
people don't like the shading to be too

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.309 
people don't like the shading to be too
much<00:03:54.580> blended<00:03:55.060> some<00:03:55.299> people<00:03:55.659> like<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.989> really

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
much blended some people like it really

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.039 
much blended some people like it really
blended<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:58.150> completely<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.750> you

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
blended so it's completely up to you

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.100 
blended so it's completely up to you
when<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.349> want<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> stop<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.870> one<00:04:04.870> thing<00:04:05.080> to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
when you want to stop and one thing to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.559 
when you want to stop and one thing to
be<00:04:05.349> careful<00:04:05.560> with<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.190> going<00:04:07.060> outside<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
be careful with is going outside of the

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.150 
be careful with is going outside of the
lines<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.110> happens<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.590> me<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.709> lot<00:04:08.769> when<00:04:09.069> I'm

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
lines it happens to me a lot when I'm

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.130 
lines it happens to me a lot when I'm
blending<00:04:09.519> since<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.849> paper<00:04:10.030> gets<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:10.720> so

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
blending since the paper gets so so

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.530 
blending since the paper gets so so
saturated<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.340> can<00:04:12.519> see<00:04:12.760> there's<00:04:13.030> some<00:04:13.209> areas

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
saturated you can see there's some areas

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.119 
saturated you can see there's some areas
where<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.780> went<00:04:13.989> out<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.319> lines<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.920> so

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
where I went out of the lines of it so

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.409 
where I went out of the lines of it so
you<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.250> have<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.549> be<00:04:15.760> really<00:04:15.970> careful<00:04:16.359> and

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
you just have to be really careful and

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.110 
you just have to be really careful and
try<00:04:17.019> not<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.289> go<00:04:17.380> too<00:04:17.410> fast<00:04:17.979> but<00:04:18.549> fast<00:04:18.970> enough

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
try not to go too fast but fast enough

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.000 
try not to go too fast but fast enough
so<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.570> ink<00:04:19.720> doesn't<00:04:19.959> dry<00:04:20.229> too<00:04:20.500> quickly<00:04:20.530> it's

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
so the ink doesn't dry too quickly it's

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.950 
so the ink doesn't dry too quickly it's
kind<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.310> tricky<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.150> figure<00:04:22.510> out<00:04:22.660> but<00:04:22.810> you'll

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
kind of tricky to figure out but you'll

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.469 
kind of tricky to figure out but you'll
get<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.229> hang<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.760> thanks<00:04:25.330> for
