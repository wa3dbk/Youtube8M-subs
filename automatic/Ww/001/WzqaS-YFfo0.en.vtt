 hair not serving the liberators if I am

 born in a very small town there 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910
 in Ecuador, the ancón is called this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.340
 brings the oil so far is the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.980
 oil there in that part of the equator and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.830
 At the age of 13 14 years old, I went up 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.140
 that the main port and I enrolled in 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.950

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.290
 a peñarol from uruguay good hurricane

 Barcelona to play that home run and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 That's where the Peñarol sees me but he 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 go 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 the managers 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 and insist on wanting to bring me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.269
 Uruguay could not give good problems 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.019
 between them and that I continued on duty is 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.720
 that same year 59 is played in the equator 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.310
 of the South American Championship now in the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.190
 Cup 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.680
 america america championship 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.180
 South American and I play for Ecuador 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.540
 for the selection of equator the technician 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.750
 our was the Uruguayan coach juan 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.780
 lopez juan lopez was the technician of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.269
 uruguay in 50 pack Canada and the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.040
 he was hired by lópez juan lópez 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.040
 he directs us we did a regular performance 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.700
 in that tournament uruguay champion came out 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.830
 Brazil also participated and is 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.220
 finished the tournament I stayed there in 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.729
 ecuador obviously and soon after and the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.530
 President of Peñarol is going to look for me 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.290
 Ecuador to bring me to put Uruguay 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.790
 agree and that's how early in the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:46.700
 year 60 I go to Uruguay this v 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.950
 They pledged until July 70 11 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.950
 Seasons 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.650
 It satisfies me enormously because in a 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.220
 big team like peñarol play 11 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.950
 season number 9 that was me it 's difficult 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.930
 it's difficult because the number 9 stay 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.930
 confrontation on Sunday that does not 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.590
 it is already beginning to complicate the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.830
 split game with the modern tube the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.990
 Young entrepreneurs are worth so much 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.990
 all transfers millions 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.880
 so at that moment they pledged payment for me 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.340
 transfer to 13 thousand two a year that 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.610
 thousand dollars that was a barbarity for 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.610
 for the moment for Ecuador was the 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.000
 first Ecuadorian player who went to 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.730
 outside then this is the same for 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.240
 promote the country's soccer me 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.750
 they gave away this but paid 13 thousand dollars 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.710
 peñarol for my transfer this day the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:58.580
 club money 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.580
 and for you included included 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.080
 at that time I went to play in 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.319
 peñarol with 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.319
 it was not very low it was very low clear nothing 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:16.229
 to do with what you now handled 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.229
 is a scorer like you were how much was worth 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.039
 it's an important thing because the 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.159
 big problems today are the problems 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.240
 of the players' entrepreneurs with 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:33.430
 a fake document 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.870
 they were false what do you think about that because 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.480
 There is so much commerce in sports 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:44.260
 Yes, it's a shame 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.960
 and I say it has been the incidence has been 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.210
 a little the incidence of trade that 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.950
 is handled so much in soccer that the 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.449
 people a little bit has run from the 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.779
 courts is no longer the show 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:01.199
 that in our time it was clear 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:04.889
 we were more we were more more folkloric more 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:07.409
 lyrics then we played for love of the 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.629
 t-shirt by the fashion to the country 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.330
 now not now it's all trade and 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.219
 then be a little bit an 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.379
 little the show as such in the 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:20.969
 football we can pause and 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:24.599
 We will come back with warnings right away in 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:27.180
 this time he would not make the 54 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.460
 goals because now the center forward 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.439
 it turns out that he has to come and defend 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.439
 I never went to my area
