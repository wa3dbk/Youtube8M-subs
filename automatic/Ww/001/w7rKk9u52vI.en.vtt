00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
at how they did it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.090 
at how they did it
so<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.109> rounds<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.619> es<00:00:19.859> C's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so this rounds going to be es C's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
so this rounds going to be es C's
default<00:00:20.640> 40<00:00:21.000> side<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.539> we'll<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.810> later<00:00:21.990> how

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
default 40 side but we'll see later how

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.509 
default 40 side but we'll see later how
it<00:00:22.289> branches<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:22.980> into<00:00:23.010> different

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it branches out into different

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400 
it branches out into different
variations<00:00:24.119> basically<00:00:24.869> everyone's<00:00:25.260> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
variations basically everyone's just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
execution for the strap is going to get

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
execution for the strap is going to get
accelerated<00:00:41.270> what<00:00:42.270> happens<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> two

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
accelerated what happens is the two

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
accelerated what happens is the two
players<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.440> beat<00:00:43.649> tunnels<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.100> execute

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
players in beat tunnels will execute

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
players in beat tunnels will execute
into<00:00:44.879> B<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.530> are

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
into B but at the same time there are

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.840 
into B but at the same time there are
three<00:00:46.710> teammates<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.370> rushing<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.789> into

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
three teammates will be rushing out into

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
three teammates will be rushing out into
middle<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.200> work<00:00:49.230> together<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
middle so they can all work together and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
middle so they can all work together and
crunch<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> B<00:00:50.489> site<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.420> most<00:00:51.539> important

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
crunch the B site the most important

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.299 
crunch the B site the most important
thing<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> mid<00:00:52.620> players<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> be

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
thing is that the mid players need to be

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
thing is that the mid players need to be
aware<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> what's<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> cutoff<00:00:54.420> CT<00:00:54.809> spawn<00:00:55.050> the

aware of what's the cutoff CT spawn the
best<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.460> did<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> pretty

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
best that they can they did a pretty

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
best that they can they did a pretty
solid<00:00:57.210> job<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.719> doing<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.140> flooding<00:00:58.440> spawn<00:00:58.770> out

solid job of doing by flooding spawn out

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.500 
solid job of doing by flooding spawn out
with<00:00:59.100> smokes<00:00:59.430> flashes<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> nades

completely claim the B side of the map
which<00:01:12.470> force<00:01:12.740> get<00:01:12.950> right<00:01:13.130> into<00:01:13.340> helping<00:01:13.700> to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
which force get right into helping to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:26.920 
which force get right into helping to
save<00:01:13.940> their<00:01:14.150> guns

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.240 

eske's<00:01:27.930> money<00:01:28.170> took<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.710> big<00:01:28.890> hit<00:01:28.950> after

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
eske's money took a pretty big hit after

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
eske's money took a pretty big hit after
losing<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.790> round<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.330> see<00:01:30.510> some<00:01:30.690> cult

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
losing that round so we see some cult

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
losing that round so we see some cult
and<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> fond<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.740> even<00:01:31.980> drops

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and I think a fond this even drops

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.680 
and I think a fond this even drops
during<00:01:32.430> freeze<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.910> for<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.180> next<00:01:33.420> round

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.030 

this<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.110> next<00:01:37.290> round<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.830> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this is the very next round here and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.260 
this is the very next round here and
we're<00:01:38.160> gonna<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.550> how<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.730> default<00:01:39.120> gets

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
we're gonna see how the default gets

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
we're gonna see how the default gets
changed<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.160> the

potentially retook this item on the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
round so so that smoke was really

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.860
