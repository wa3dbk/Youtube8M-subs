00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
18 and that's actually a lot considering

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
18 and that's actually a lot considering
it's<00:01:13.410> just<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.770> simple<00:01:14.190> mastery<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's just a simple mastery and here we

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's just a simple mastery and here we
have<00:01:17.820> Archmage<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:19.260> gives<00:01:19.820> which

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
have Archmage which gives which

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
have Archmage which gives which
increases<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.360> ability<00:01:21.630> power<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:21.930> five

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
increases my ability power by five

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.270 
increases my ability power by five
percent<00:01:22.820> which<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.290> not<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.440> much<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.979> course

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
percent which is not that much of course

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.170 
percent which is not that much of course
but<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.300> every<00:01:28.140> AP<00:01:28.650> counts<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
but it's every AP counts in this kind of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.870 
but it's every AP counts in this kind of
if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.260> want<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> max<00:01:31.920> ap<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.640> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
if you want to get the max ap with just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.400 
if you want to get the max ap with just
runes<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.210> masteries<00:01:33.300> of<00:01:33.690> course<00:01:34.460> so

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
runes and masteries of course so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:47.340 
runes and masteries of course so
Archmage<00:01:38.810> forgives<00:01:39.810> me<00:01:39.869> five<00:01:40.560> percent<00:01:43.160> ap

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.100 

okay<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:50.240> know<00:01:50.270> these<00:01:50.570> are<00:01:50.690> really<00:01:50.870> matter

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
okay so you know these are really matter

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.370 
okay so you know these are really matter
because<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.620> just<00:01:52.040> wanted<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:52.580> down<00:01:52.910> here

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
because I just wanted to get down here

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.290 
because I just wanted to get down here
so<00:01:54.380> if<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.800> add<00:01:55.070> all<00:01:55.100> these<00:01:55.490> together<00:01:55.670> it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
so if you add all these together it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.000 
so if you add all these together it
would<00:01:56.480> equal<00:01:56.810> to<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.350> ruins<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.980> the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
would equal to so the ruins and the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.820 
would equal to so the ruins and the
metaphor<00:02:04.610> sandblast<00:02:05.000> mastery<00:02:05.690> would<00:02:05.930> make<00:02:06.470> 90

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
metaphor sandblast mastery would make 90

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.620 
metaphor sandblast mastery would make 90
and<00:02:07.040> Archmage<00:02:07.730> will<00:02:07.910> increase<00:02:08.210> your<00:02:08.390> ability

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
and Archmage will increase your ability

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.290 
and Archmage will increase your ability
power<00:02:08.960> by<00:02:09.229> five<00:02:09.440> percent<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.070> five<00:02:11.000> percent

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
power by five percent and five percent

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.400 
power by five percent and five percent
of<00:02:11.360> 90<00:02:11.750> would<00:02:11.960> be<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.090> 4.5<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.170> course

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
of 90 would be if you 4.5 of course

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.460 
of 90 would be if you 4.5 of course
legal<00:02:19.160> urging<00:02:19.430> does<00:02:19.670> round<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.350> goes

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
legal urging does round that so it goes

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.790 
legal urging does round that so it goes
to<00:02:21.590> 95<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:22.640> I'm<00:02:22.790> gonna<00:02:22.910> show<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.500> is
