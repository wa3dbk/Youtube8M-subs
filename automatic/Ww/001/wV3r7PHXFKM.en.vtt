00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.419
 Welcome to military bases in Gaddafi 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.419
 all costs are enough for the security researchers 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.119
 Dr costs this so-called zarate tablet pc so and fold out or 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 but rather to do something 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.680
 for Ernst Plank so far with only 500 euros the extremely cheap than usual 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.820
 The cost of other is Herbert as it was said at least 3 to five times as many 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.240
 because the price in this segment is moving normally 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.880
 Outside, around 4500 Euro 2 of those products happen either for the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.260
 TuS 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.990
 Streep in the b2b sector or vertical markets were developed Wieland 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.890
 military budde the medical field the course 9 is not only for that reason 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.290
 a special exception but also because specifically for Franco and such 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.580
 Menton developed 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.460
 and even cheaper 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 when the smaller of July finally she and who means nothing 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.580
 was developed in the battery 9 mainly for the end user 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.270
 he also knows against the otherwise the heaviest Slate Tablet pc's one 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.150
 Duck mother appointed consumption and memory of many the processing of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.860
 Housing is really outstanding and without defects and with the thin 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.780
 Leg on the back 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.160
 Kammann because from courses one also vertically positioned 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 However, this pillar is not very durable in the long run and it 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 Sounds very strong in a grid and you have it here if the help of a 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.870
 Pen point he has the 9 is built extremely thin and just measures 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.850
 infected by 1 comes to them centimeters 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.369
 With 800 grams, it is certainly not difficult and therefore fits well in the hand 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.630
 The Steinacher is missing so that you can not by turning the device 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.680
 binds portrait mode automatically XVI the input options are also 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.660
 quite limited for the virtual qwerty keyboard keyboard of Archos 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.190
 are not sensitive enough and I can handle ten fingers badly 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.570
 You also have to show the keyboard English if necessary and one 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.600
 Recognition software error which is not really user-friendly 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.110
 You can write long texts with this device 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 not really going down on the page can take a pen out with 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.250
 which you can definitely work in more detail 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.240
 but this flies through the thickest thing and therefore there is none 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.650
 Risk of breakage of the CDAX Peace in itself is unfortunately not possible at an angle and 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 is factory-built or not very accurate 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.179
 Alternatively, however, an optical table other than Saxony is still available 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:54.519
 those who work a bit more closely and are on the left side 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.869
 the cadets big heart rest 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:02.069
 What is also wrong with this device is the Archos 9 is absolutely credible 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.649
 because no fan is not available for cooling in their components 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.440
 All Werner must therefore be removed via the housing 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.100
 and in the left area the surface will drive neatly the little one 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.780
 Intel parents z510 counter tons of process was 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 but is designed for this and temperature points, however, because of its 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.209
 low clock frequency of 3 1 come into play he has 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.540
 not particularly at the Borker format from youtube and hd videos are because of the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.080
 not activatable has the acceleration 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.000
 is the most important in Freden Intel theme 500 graphics chips in the tourist center 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.690
 Butschek 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.809
 not for you 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.439
 Plavix and x-raid leathers run smoothly 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.949
 The pre-installed Windows 7 operating system, however, catch Tat 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.579
 brings the system to its performance with only one gigabyte of ddr2 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.579
 400 working memory until not much scope available 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.719
 the hard drive is with 60 gigabytes sums a small device so big enough 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.839
 a lot of data movies and music even if it is already small race course 5 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.889
 Internet tablet with Google Android operating system even with one 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.279
 500 gigabyte hard drive gives 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.769
 the Archos 9 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.220
 has only a USB and an audio word at the bottom is an extension 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.050
 Slot available however missing for it 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.580
 the docking stations 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.370
 a second usb port 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.050
 and then the cup is unfortunately missing again 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.119
 that would really be very important features for this money 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.930
 Dr the newly developed and I the display 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.819
 with a diagonal of almost 9 inches 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.890
 the resolution is a thousand 24 by 600 pixels 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.720
 and the brightness is with 130 to 170 blogs 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.050
 to be classified as good, the illumination is not quite homogeneous 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.889
 the taz is signed 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.240
 Tripp minimal that is true and at certain ride areas are vertical stripes 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.129
 visible 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.919
 but in a normal color photograph or flying are not recognizable 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.520
 the presentation quality is very good to us and Dale Earnhardt can also be found in the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.589
 Free recognize enough free as long as the sun does not seem too strong 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.370
 because of the thin construction and it goes in the meantime weight is the Archos 9 one 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.759
 unbeatable companion for traveling in the documents that he estimates falls 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.279
 not at all 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.439
 you just take it out and you can even spend about three to five hours around 45 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.770
 Minutes off with it 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.050
 because the rescue silver tower processor 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.809
 Consumes little power 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.119
 unfortunately, you can not upgrade in Arcos nor is a umts- auction 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:44.479
 present so this device is not really as mobile internet 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.839
 Workstations can serve 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.279
 are to be delivered Windows 7 Starter Edition 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.069
 Operating system some additional programs 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.069
 This is not up to the company 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.870
 and a Lotus Symphony pros pleading from Tel's surfaces pleaded 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.690
 With a detailed review of the Marcos 9 he kicks ready 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.419
 had with established powers 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.130
 you will soon find on our website at www 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.879
 bon credit more concrete 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.719
 Thank you to be Lord 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:14.439
 and yet many things
