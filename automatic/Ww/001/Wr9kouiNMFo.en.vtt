00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.480 

let's<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.110> an<00:00:04.259> interior<00:00:04.650> scene<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.279> talk

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
let's look at an interior scene and talk

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.150 
let's look at an interior scene and talk
about<00:00:05.640> when<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> use<00:00:06.240> final<00:00:06.720> gather<00:00:07.160> remember

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
about when to use final gather remember

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.070 
about when to use final gather remember
the<00:00:08.280> final<00:00:08.639> gather<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.360> bounce<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.870> light

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the final gather is one bounce of light

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.350 
the final gather is one bounce of light
we're<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> look<00:00:11.429> at<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.730> render<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.300> a

from our Sun and fixtures from floor to
ceiling<00:00:34.130> we've<00:00:35.130> added<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.520> type<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> light

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
called atmosphere this is a sky dome

light coming from the sky this slide is
without<00:00:44.340> atmosphere<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:47.160> slide<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
without atmosphere and this slide is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.560 
without atmosphere and this slide is
with<00:00:48.090> atmosphere<00:00:49.370> finally<00:00:50.370> we've<00:00:50.940> turned<00:00:51.329> on

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
with atmosphere finally we've turned on

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
with atmosphere finally we've turned on
ambient<00:00:52.140> occlusion<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:53.129> produce<00:00:53.430> nice

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
ambient occlusion to produce nice

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580 
ambient occlusion to produce nice
contact<00:00:54.239> shadows<00:00:54.629> under<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:54.930> furniture

let's<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:56.820> these<00:00:56.940> slides<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
let's look at these slides in the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.520 
let's look at these slides in the
difference<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> makes

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
difference it makes

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
difference it makes
without<00:00:59.160> ambient<00:00:59.609> occlusion<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.410> finally

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
without ambient occlusion and finally

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
without ambient occlusion and finally
this<00:01:01.559> slide<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.219> ambient<00:01:02.789> occlusion<00:01:03.650> we've

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this slide with ambient occlusion we've

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.250

very<00:01:14.760> rapid<00:01:15.240> renders<00:01:16.640> let's<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> look<00:01:18.270> now

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
very rapid renders let's take a look now

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.950 
very rapid renders let's take a look now
at<00:01:18.479> radiosity<00:01:19.549> first<00:01:20.549> an<00:01:20.850> image<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.509> final

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
gather only now will generate radiosity

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
gather only now will generate radiosity
and<00:01:25.369> add<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.610> extra<00:01:26.850> bouncing<00:01:27.509> light<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.900> our

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and add this extra bouncing light to our

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.859 
and add this extra bouncing light to our
render<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.390> subtle<00:01:30.659> effect

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
render this can be a very subtle effect

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.530 
render this can be a very subtle effect
but<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.130> important<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.000> increased

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
but it's very important for increased
