00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.649
 Car wash at a low price that promises Messner rotten 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.750
 the business with the dirt leadership 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.579
 32 so-called super centers 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.729
 There are now in Germany 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.690
 with 500 permanent employees Potsdam about 500 temporary help 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.050
 a bone job 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.140
 also here in one of the two branches of Cologne 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.570
 the 25-year-old Peter working the animals Pauli a good hourly wage 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 she was promised she does not want to be recognized 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.430
 the store manager had said 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.430
 that you could usually come to 8 to 9 euros 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.149
 but the reality is different 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.010
 Frontal21 are pictures taken with a hidden camera 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.030
 they show the billing and utah 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.839
 a temporary employee 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:56.499
 has sucked 569 cars in four days and gets for 123 euros gross that makes 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:02.109
 an hourly wage of 3 EUR 97 but Mister does not expect hour 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.690
 We used to pay six euros an hour, but we have abolished 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.350
 now forced the commissions 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.060
 «For every car where they work, there are two euros 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 and when ten people are on the tape everyone gets 20 cents 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.219
 but it can not even exist in bad weather for example 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.850
 if nobody comes, it means many employees 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 wait without title payment 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.920
 In the winter months it happened to me again and again that no customers come 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 you sit in the break room Grohmann is no longer registered on the assembly line and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 does not earn money 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 who protest five cars in 8 hours working time 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.210
 then gets a euro pay for a whole day with Mr. Horsch 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.250
 this is pure exploitation when the term immoral wages 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.219
 would have to be defined then it would be at the Porsche probably on 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.020
 best 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.549
 and especially the temporary workers are helpless 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.460
 because they have no employment contract on which they could appeal 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.590
 we ask for a manager 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499
 the son of the company founder 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.059
 we have so far 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:15.489
 he was, so to speak, out of our history with such cases had little to do 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.249
 believed the 4 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.559
 with temporary help 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.169
 these employment contracts do not cover these formal employment contracts in this form 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.889
 have to meet 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.839
 "We'll check that and then change that if necessary then that's it 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.399
 Changed at the end of January 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.929
 for the family business of Antifa is developing magnificently 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.639
 The ban has earned millions for years 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.219
 because the bad weather so the company risk the employees 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.179
 carry 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.359
 that justifies that 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.769
 the entrepreneurial risk is therein 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.370
 the paper over the past five years for this new business 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.499
 Invested 60 million euros 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.979
 for those funds 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.529
 We had to serve the banks and brought them home 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
 Employees do not bear any economic risk with us 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.119
 they can 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.299
 and not only the temporary employees but also the permanent employees 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.199
 example 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.539
 Nuremberg 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:14.049
 since 2008 you have a Mister rotten Super Center 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.129
 Michaela worked here for one year in the interior cleaning 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.359
 he too does not want to be recognized 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.359
 By contract, seven euros are the hour to speak a worthless spa 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.659
 when I got my first pay 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.560
 I realized this is only commission there and that was much lower I am 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:38.109
 went to the boss and said in my contract is hourly pay 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.389
 but not then I did not hear from him anymore 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.549
 and it goes even further example Dusseldorf 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.180
 Employees are additionally liable with their tips 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.099
 The bosses should have told him 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.179
 what the customers throw in here for employees often does not matter 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.689
 I've been here for five months, who should drink every month 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.409
 become 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.139
 but mostly there is no question why 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.499
 The bosses say because what has broken is a scratch on the car or something 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.749
 paid by the tip 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.599
 According to frontal 21 searches, this is also the case in Nuremberg and Cologne 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:23.099
 It's about a lot of money on good days go by up to 500 cars 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.580
 Car wash the customers give on average one and so high can 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.400
 per year at 32 plants 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.279
 3 million euros come together 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.150
 Mühlenberg is not just a tip 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.830
 Sundern 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.529
 also in the pay packet 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.690
 if we have broken something 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.380
 then the employees should pay even though the company is insured 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 the damage appears as a so-called advance on the pay slip 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.850
 here 150 euros for a broken mirror then it will be the people of 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.510
 deducted less pay and on the enquete billing as advance of the 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.380
 Device as well as the trial here 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.960
 Disguise things that are legally illegal in our view 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.730
 most employees accept such exploitation 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.040
 Many have a migrant background or are poorly trained 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.950
 come there then try saying but now do something about it 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.990
 then they do not go this way 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.350
 out of fear because they explain us 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.759
 if we do something then we also lose that activity 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.210
 And they also take health risks 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.630
 For 8 hours Grone rubber gloves or respiratory masks need the staff 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.259
 among other things with diluted glass cleaner 0 or Boni fly means 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.139
 handling 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.759
 extensive data sheets warn of the effect of the chemicals contained 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.779
 can cause irritation of the eyes Holtz and axes ways 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.180
 May cause drowsiness and dizziness 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.999
 Wear protective goggles and protective gloves 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.340
 In the evening I noticed 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.770
 because there was a rash on the fingertips on the hands as well 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.180
 Reid in the eyes we had wear no gloves no gloves 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.599
 Again, we ask after Mister does not care Dr is unaware 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.870
 I hear that for the very first time, that's also from the point of view 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.379
 our branch manager 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.229
 but not to speak 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.589
 as well as the fact that the agency for work in the winter the salary of some 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.789
 Employees must increase to hartz4 level 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.279
 That was a 40-hour week and bone work 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.160
 Mister Bursch makes 205 million euros in sales per year 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.779
 The three chief executives happen according to the annual report 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.939
 together one point 4 million euro salary 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.889
 clean car in a good mood 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.180
 that probably only has 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.889
 Mr. Horsch
