happen to have them all three in-house

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889 
happen to have them all three in-house
and<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.149> let<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> guys<00:00:54.510> decide

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
which you think is is the best of the

which you think is is the best of the
three<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.899> you're<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.500> trying

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
three and then if you're you're trying

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.279 
three and then if you're you're trying
to<00:00:58.859> decide<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.550> should<00:00:59.910> pick<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.329> maybe

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to decide which you should pick up maybe

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
to decide which you should pick up maybe
this<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.590> help<00:01:01.620> especially<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.489> you're

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this will help especially if you're

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
this will help especially if you're
going<00:01:02.760> after<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.390> considering<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> gold

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
going after or considering the gold

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
going after or considering the gold
maybe<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.280> show<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> exactly<00:01:05.729> what

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
maybe this will show you exactly what

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
maybe this will show you exactly what
the<00:01:06.330> color<00:01:06.540> looks<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the color looks like and then if you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590

see all these lines that kind of creep
around<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.470> device<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.729> dark<00:01:42.060> or

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
version actually white so they add a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.600 
version actually white so they add a
little<00:01:47.040> bit<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> contrast<00:01:49.189> now<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.430> flip

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
little bit of contrast now if we flip

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.020 
little bit of contrast now if we flip
over<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> front<00:01:52.159> you'll<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.460> all<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
over to the front you'll see all of that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
over to the front you'll see all of that
dark<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.600> continued<00:01:55.140> including<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.740> dark

while it's not black it's definitely the
darker<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> three<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> beautifully

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
darker of the three it's a beautifully

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.960 
darker of the three it's a beautifully
beautifully<00:02:09.539> made<00:02:09.720> device

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
beautifully made device

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
beautifully made device
just<00:02:11.720> wish<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:11.990> could<00:02:12.170> get<00:02:12.260> those<00:02:12.440> logos<00:02:12.740> off

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
just wish we could get those logos off

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.330 
just wish we could get those logos off
of<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.940> gunmetal<00:02:14.240> gray<00:02:15.340> set

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
of there so there is gunmetal gray set

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
and let's jump into silver since we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.230 
and let's jump into silver since we
showed<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.580> our<00:02:19.700> google<00:02:20.000> play

a<00:02:23.510> lot<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.140> silver<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.680> saw<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.100> last

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
a lot like the silver we saw in last

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.970 
a lot like the silver we saw in last
year's<00:02:25.700> HTC<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.630> then<00:02:27.590> again<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.950> have

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
year's HTC one and then again you have

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.250 
year's HTC one and then again you have
these<00:02:28.280> lighter<00:02:28.640> white<00:02:29.060> accents<00:02:29.900> throughout

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
these lighter white accents throughout

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.530 
these lighter white accents throughout
so<00:02:31.070> whereas<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.490> gunmetal<00:02:31.760> gray<00:02:32.090> really<00:02:32.390> went

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so whereas the gunmetal gray really went

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.060 
so whereas the gunmetal gray really went
with<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.720> dark<00:02:33.110> overall<00:02:33.560> theme

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
with that dark overall theme

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.120 
with that dark overall theme
you<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:34.910> get<00:02:35.120> some<00:02:35.420> lighter<00:02:35.810> pops<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.530> color<00:02:36.800> in

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
you do get some lighter pops of color in

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.500 
you do get some lighter pops of color in
this<00:02:38.030> version<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.090> spin<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.450> around

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
this version so we can spin it around

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.790 
this version so we can spin it around
and<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:42.080> see<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:42.440> these<00:02:42.650> little

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and you can see all these little

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.600 
and you can see all these little
highlights<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:45.380> then<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.100> even<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.490> this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
highlights and then you even have this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.490 
highlights and then you even have this
sort<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.970> white<00:02:47.209> highlight<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.870> runs<00:02:48.140> kind

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
sort of white highlight that runs kind

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.740 
sort of white highlight that runs kind
of<00:02:48.590> around<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.100> whole<00:02:49.280> device<00:02:49.640> which<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.570> kind

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
of around the whole device which is kind

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.360 
of around the whole device which is kind
of<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.900> nice<00:02:51.050> touch<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:51.709> breaks<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.220> up

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of a nice touch that really breaks it up

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.880 
of a nice touch that really breaks it up
and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.480> obviously<00:02:53.660> silver<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:54.709> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and then obviously silver here and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.510 
and then obviously silver here and
silver<00:02:55.340> here<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.590> there<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> silver

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
silver here so there is the silver

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.230 
silver here so there is the silver
variant<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.240> last<00:03:00.050> but<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:00.380> least<00:03:01.090> here<00:03:02.090> is

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240
