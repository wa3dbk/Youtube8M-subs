parlay that to anybody that comes to

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.259 
parlay that to anybody that comes to
visit<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:11.139> started<00:00:11.469> a<00:00:11.559> pipe<00:00:11.799> off<00:00:12.070> of<00:00:12.370> the<00:00:12.519> pipe

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
visit we started a pipe off of the pipe

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.199 
visit we started a pipe off of the pipe
warmer<00:00:13.889> which<00:00:14.889> warms<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.429> pipes<00:00:15.669> up<00:00:15.940> enough

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
warmer which warms the pipes up enough

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.599 
warmer which warms the pipes up enough
to<00:00:16.240> get<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.720> glass<00:00:16.990> to<00:00:17.230> stick<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:18.340> we<00:00:18.429> come

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
to get the glass to stick and we come

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.999 
to get the glass to stick and we come
over<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.060> furnace<00:00:19.510> and<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:20.890> where

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
over to the furnace and this is where

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.210 
over to the furnace and this is where
all<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.160> glass<00:00:21.490> comes<00:00:21.910> from<00:00:22.349> its<00:00:23.349> 2,000

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
all the glass comes from its 2,000

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.859 
all the glass comes from its 2,000
degrees<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.439> we<00:00:26.560> take<00:00:26.769> the<00:00:27.009> warm<00:00:27.339> rod<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:28.720> go

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
degrees so we take the warm rod we go

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
degrees so we take the warm rod we go
down<00:00:29.050> into<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.679> furnace<00:00:30.570> together<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.749> little

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
down into the furnace together a little

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.830 
down into the furnace together a little
it's<00:00:33.610> what's<00:00:33.789> called<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.090> gather<00:00:34.360> is<00:00:34.660> the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
it's what's called a gather is the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.029 
it's what's called a gather is the
amount<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.110> glass<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.379> get<00:00:35.649> on<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.860> end<00:00:35.950> of

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
amount of glass you get on the end of

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.819 
amount of glass you get on the end of
the<00:00:36.100> pipe<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:37.780> older<00:00:37.960> brother<00:00:38.170> was<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.379> senior

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
when i was a freshman at Salisbury

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.240 
when i was a freshman at Salisbury
University<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:41.230> saw<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.710> stuff<00:00:41.980> he<00:00:42.129> was

University I saw the stuff he was

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.410 
University I saw the stuff he was
bringing<00:00:42.460> back<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.820> my<00:00:42.879> parents<00:00:43.090> house

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
bringing back to my parents house

bringing back to my parents house
shape-wise<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.710> form<00:00:44.949> why's<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:45.370> was<00:00:45.570> really

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
shape-wise and form why's it was really

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.510 
shape-wise and form why's it was really
gross<00:00:46.809> but<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.170> was<00:00:47.289> like<00:00:47.500> just<00:00:47.710> really

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
gross but it was like just really

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520 
gross but it was like just really
intrigued<00:00:48.879> me<00:00:48.910> that<00:00:49.180> you<00:00:49.270> could<00:00:49.420> make<00:00:49.690> stuff

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
intrigued me that you could make stuff

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.260 
intrigued me that you could make stuff
with<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.190> medium<00:00:51.640> because<00:00:51.820> I've<00:00:51.940> never<00:00:52.120> even

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
with that medium because I've never even

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.900 
with that medium because I've never even
seen<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.719> before<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:54.129> we<00:00:54.219> come<00:00:54.370> over<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.670> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
seen it before then we come over to the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.150 
seen it before then we come over to the
colors<00:00:55.359> and<00:00:56.050> you<00:00:56.140> just<00:00:56.289> touch<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:56.590> down<00:00:56.949> in

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
colors and you just touch it down in

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.970 
colors and you just touch it down in
there<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:58.059> what<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.420> does<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:58.899> just<00:00:59.170> gets<00:00:59.500> all

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
there so what this does is just gets all

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.250 
there so what this does is just gets all
these<00:01:00.280> little<00:01:00.550> crushed<00:01:01.059> up<00:01:01.300> colored<00:01:01.840> glass

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
these little crushed up colored glass

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.140 
these little crushed up colored glass
bits<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:03.760> stick<00:01:04.269> onto<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.140> glass<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.909> when<00:01:07.060> I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
bits to stick onto the glass so when I

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.090 
bits to stick onto the glass so when I
was<00:01:07.270> starting<00:01:07.869> my<00:01:08.140> first<00:01:08.350> semester<00:01:08.560> freshman

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
up to get all those bits to dissolve in

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.060 
up to get all those bits to dissolve in
to<00:01:36.040> melt<00:01:36.250> into<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.610> therapist<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.799> heat

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
to melt into the therapist so this heat

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.190 
to melt into the therapist so this heat
is<00:01:39.100> what<00:01:39.369> infuses<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.299> color<00:01:40.540> into<00:01:41.110> the

Salisbury<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.460> was<00:01:48.579> probably<00:01:48.700> putting<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.119> like

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
Salisbury I was probably putting in like

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.569 
Salisbury I was probably putting in like
20<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.630> 25<00:01:49.990> hours<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.290> week<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.680> that's<00:01:51.369> when<00:01:51.549> I

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
20 to 25 hours a week and that's when I

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.100 
20 to 25 hours a week and that's when I
started<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.119> really<00:01:52.299> see<00:01:52.750> my<00:01:52.960> work

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
started to really see my work

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.859 
started to really see my work
progressing<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.799> little<00:01:54.039> bit<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.720> give<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.810> a

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
progressing a little bit I give it a

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.810 
progressing a little bit I give it a
roll<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.560> table<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.250> put<00:01:57.399> in<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.670> little

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
roll on the table to put in a little

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.260 
roll on the table to put in a little
more<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.240> cylindrical<00:01:58.630> shape<00:01:59.200> a<00:02:00.240> year<00:02:01.240> or

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
more of a cylindrical shape a year or

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.990 
more of a cylindrical shape a year or
two<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.899> make<00:02:02.229> stuff<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.860> five<00:02:03.610> or<00:02:03.640> ten

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
two you can make stuff in five or ten

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.810 
two you can make stuff in five or ten
you<00:02:04.149> can<00:02:04.179> make<00:02:04.420> stuff<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.899> like<00:02:04.929> in<00:02:05.820> 10

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
you can make stuff that you like in 10

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.150 
you can make stuff that you like in 10
to<00:02:06.970> 20<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.479> make<00:02:07.600> whatever<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.990> want<00:02:08.200> and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
to 20 you can make whatever you want and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.889 
to 20 you can make whatever you want and
now<00:02:09.459> we're<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.759> do<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.000> blow<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> end

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
now we're going to do is blow on the end

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.839 
now we're going to do is blow on the end
of<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.080> rod<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.010> cap<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.519> with<00:02:12.640> my<00:02:12.819> thumb

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
of the rod and I cap it with my thumb

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.600 
of the rod and I cap it with my thumb
what<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.989> does<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.230> traps<00:02:14.680> air<00:02:14.890> pressure<00:02:15.370> in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
what that does is traps air pressure in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.570 
what that does is traps air pressure in
the<00:02:15.700> rod<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:17.650> air<00:02:17.950> pressure<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the rod that air pressure that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580 
the rod that air pressure that
compressed<00:02:18.940> air<00:02:19.120> pushes<00:02:19.510> its<00:02:19.690> way<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:19.900> into

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
compressed air pushes its way out into

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.990 
compressed air pushes its way out into
the<00:02:20.860> glass<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.400> see<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:21.640> gets<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.880> little

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
the glass you can see it gets a little

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.870 
the glass you can see it gets a little
fatter<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:23.380> what<00:02:23.470> happens<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.400> compressed

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
fatter so what happens is the compressed

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.210 
fatter so what happens is the compressed
air<00:02:24.970> pushes<00:02:25.600> its<00:02:25.780> way<00:02:25.870> out<00:02:25.989> as<00:02:26.350> long<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
air pushes its way out as long as the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.910 
air pushes its way out as long as the
glass<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.760> soft<00:02:28.060> enough<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.930> pushes<00:02:29.799> out

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
glass is soft enough it pushes out

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.610 
glass is soft enough it pushes out
pretty<00:02:30.190> easily<00:02:31.019> what<00:02:32.019> I'm<00:02:32.110> doing<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.319> shaping

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
pretty easily what I'm doing is shaping

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.339 
pretty easily what I'm doing is shaping
the<00:02:32.860> tip<00:02:33.099> one<00:02:33.310> more<00:02:33.489> time<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.299> I'm<00:02:35.230> going

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
the tip one more time and then I'm going

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.890 
the tip one more time and then I'm going
to<00:02:35.380> give<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:35.799> more<00:02:35.830> burst<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.400> air<00:02:36.870> when<00:02:37.870> i

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
to give it one more burst to air when i

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.360 
to give it one more burst to air when i
first<00:02:38.140> started<00:02:38.319> blowing<00:02:38.530> glass<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.130> never

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
first started blowing glass I never

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.190 
first started blowing glass I never
thought<00:02:39.459> oh<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.000> would<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> great<00:02:40.810> career

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
thought oh this would be a great career

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.949 
thought oh this would be a great career
I<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.099> cool<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.540> fun<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
I was like this is cool is to be fun to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.740 
I was like this is cool is to be fun to
do<00:02:44.500> next<00:02:45.069> semester<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:46.150> would<00:02:46.299> be<00:02:46.390> fun<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> do

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
do next semester this would be fun to do

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.050 
do next semester this would be fun to do
next<00:02:46.900> week<00:02:47.049> next<00:02:47.530> month<00:02:47.680> whatever<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.370> then

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
next week next month whatever and then

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.310 
next week next month whatever and then
it<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.299> got<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.570> point<00:02:49.600> after<00:02:49.900> about<00:02:50.109> five

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
it just got to a point after about five

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.630 
it just got to a point after about five
years<00:02:50.560> where<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.829> was<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.040> how<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.459> keep

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
years where I was like how can I keep

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.009 
years where I was like how can I keep
doing<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.090> that's<00:02:52.420> when<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> started<00:02:52.900> to

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
doing this and that's when I started to

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.630 
doing this and that's when I started to
think<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.799> business<00:02:54.010> end<00:02:54.370> because

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
think about the business end because

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.310 
think about the business end because
there's<00:02:55.180> not<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.359> whole<00:02:55.540> lot<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.750> ways<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.079> do<00:02:56.200> it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
there's not a whole lot of ways to do it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.830 
there's not a whole lot of ways to do it
after<00:02:56.410> college<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.910> what<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.060> knew<00:02:58.239> next<00:02:58.510> is

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
after college so what I knew next is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.880 
after college so what I knew next is
start<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.350> constriction<00:03:00.310> with<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.000> jacks<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
start a constriction with the jacks and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.660 
start a constriction with the jacks and
Ariana's<00:03:02.890> gonna<00:03:02.980> give<00:03:03.160> me<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> little<00:03:03.430> air

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
Ariana's gonna give me a little air

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.319 
Ariana's gonna give me a little air
pressure<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.870> go<00:03:05.109> ahead<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.530> blow<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
pressure so go ahead and blow it's the

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.750 
pressure so go ahead and blow it's the
best<00:03:07.600> feeling<00:03:07.930> when<00:03:08.410> stuffs<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.400> smoothly

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
best feeling when stuffs going smoothly

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.809 
best feeling when stuffs going smoothly
and<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.829> your<00:03:11.950> pieces<00:03:12.130> are<00:03:12.400> turning<00:03:12.700> out<00:03:12.790> well

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and and your pieces are turning out well

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.940 
and and your pieces are turning out well
and<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.720> know<00:03:13.840> my<00:03:13.959> hands<00:03:14.350> are<00:03:14.440> working<00:03:14.799> well

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and you know my hands are working well

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.620 
and you know my hands are working well
with<00:03:14.980> my<00:03:15.190> brain<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.510> all

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
with my brain and it's just all

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.930 
with my brain and it's just all
translating<00:03:17.350> well<00:03:17.500> into<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.859> piece<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
translating well into the piece it's the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.970 
translating well into the piece it's the
best<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.660> know<00:03:19.690> for<00:03:19.870> all<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.959> all<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.590> ones

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
best you know for all the all the ones

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.319 
best you know for all the all the ones
that<00:03:21.190> aren't<00:03:21.489> coming<00:03:21.730> out<00:03:21.850> right<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.299> just

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
that aren't coming out right it just

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.020 
that aren't coming out right it just
takes<00:03:22.660> one<00:03:22.930> really<00:03:23.530> good<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.880> you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
takes one really good one that you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.789 
takes one really good one that you
forget<00:03:25.359> about<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> mess<00:03:26.139> ups<00:03:26.380> along<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
forget about all the mess ups along the

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.620 
forget about all the mess ups along the
way

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
way

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.120 
way
so<00:03:28.080> what<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:28.260> doing<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.590> cutting<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.070> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
so what I'm doing is cutting in a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.460 
so what I'm doing is cutting in a
constriction<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:30.150> Ariane<00:03:31.110> does<00:03:31.350> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
constriction as Ariane does the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.470 
constriction as Ariane does the
inflating<00:03:32.130> its<00:03:32.970> stuff<00:03:33.480> blowing<00:03:35.330> so<00:03:36.330> this

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
inflating its stuff blowing so this

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.300 
inflating its stuff blowing so this
constriction<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.320> going<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> allow<00:03:37.830> me<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.160> get

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
constriction is going to allow me to get

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.450 
constriction is going to allow me to get
the<00:03:38.460> piece<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.930> pipe<00:03:40.250> once<00:03:41.250> we're

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
the piece off of the pipe once we're

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.330 
the piece off of the pipe once we're
finished<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> blowing<00:03:42.600> process<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
finished with the blowing process the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.400 
finished with the blowing process the

Bernstein business plan competition I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.190 
Bernstein business plan competition I
was<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.150> college<00:03:57.330> student<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.840> saw<00:03:58.020> five

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
was a college student and I saw five

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.660 
was a college student and I saw five
thousand<00:03:58.650> dollars<00:03:58.920> that's<00:03:59.070> about<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.640> I

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
thousand dollars that's about it and I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.940 
thousand dollars that's about it and I
saw<00:03:59.850> business<00:04:00.270> plan<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.780> was<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:00.990> how<00:04:01.680> hard

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
saw business plan so I was like how hard

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.940 
saw business plan so I was like how hard
can<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.130> be<00:04:02.570> which<00:04:03.570> which<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> dumbest

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
can that be which which is the dumbest

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.920 
can that be which which is the dumbest
approach<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.330> was<00:04:06.450> about<00:04:06.870> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
approach that was like it was about a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.900 
approach that was like it was about a
year<00:04:07.050> of<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.410> life<00:04:07.440> I'd<00:04:07.920> been<00:04:08.130> blowing<00:04:08.430> blast<00:04:08.640> a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
year of my life I'd been blowing blast a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.040 
year of my life I'd been blowing blast a
little<00:04:09.180> over<00:04:09.330> three<00:04:09.510> years<00:04:09.540> at<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:09.930> point

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
little over three years at that point

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.100 
little over three years at that point
and<00:04:10.670> no<00:04:11.670> way<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.240> anywhere<00:04:12.570> comfortable

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
and no way was I anywhere comfortable

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.070 
and no way was I anywhere comfortable
enough<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.590> open<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.430> glassblowing<00:04:15.000> studio<00:04:15.180> but

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
enough to open a glassblowing studio but

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.530 
enough to open a glassblowing studio but
I<00:04:16.350> entertained<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.040> idea<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.299> did

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
I entertained the idea what if I did

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.210 
I entertained the idea what if I did
start<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.930> glassblowing<00:04:19.410> studio<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:20.100> would

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
start a glassblowing studio that would

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.970 
start a glassblowing studio that would
be<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:21.150> awesome<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.959> wouldn't<00:04:22.620> even<00:04:22.680> know<00:04:22.860> where

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
be so awesome I wouldn't even know where

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.680 
be so awesome I wouldn't even know where
to<00:04:23.040> start<00:04:23.130> so<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:23.850> this<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.300> stuff<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
to start so is this all the stuff that I

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.630 
to start so is this all the stuff that I
never<00:04:24.900> would<00:04:25.140> have<00:04:25.200> thought<00:04:25.350> about<00:04:25.710> otherwise

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
never would have thought about otherwise

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.850 
never would have thought about otherwise
but<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:27.660> business<00:04:28.020> plan<00:04:28.140> forced<00:04:28.650> me<00:04:28.770> to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
but this business plan forced me to

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.250 
but this business plan forced me to
start<00:04:29.070> thinking<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.970> terms<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.630> making<00:04:31.050> a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
start thinking in in terms of making a

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.980 
start thinking in in terms of making a
business<00:04:31.650> out<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.070> hobby<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:33.570> what<00:04:33.690> Ariane

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
business out of a hobby so what Ariane

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.789 
business out of a hobby so what Ariane
is<00:04:34.020> doing<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.530> now<00:04:34.650> heating<00:04:35.100> up<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.340> pipe

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:37.799 

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.049 

that<00:04:38.799> we're<00:04:38.919> going<00:04:39.009> to<00:04:39.099> attach<00:04:39.189> to<00:04:39.579> the<00:04:39.669> bottom

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:40.059 
that we're going to attach to the bottom

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:41.609 
that we're going to attach to the bottom
of<00:04:40.149> this<00:04:40.209> bowl<00:04:40.629> so<00:04:40.869> we<00:04:40.959> can<00:04:41.079> break<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.469> free

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:41.619 
of this bowl so we can break it free

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:43.019 
of this bowl so we can break it free
from<00:04:41.829> the<00:04:41.979> blowpipe<00:04:42.429> and<00:04:42.639> then<00:04:42.789> we'll<00:04:42.879> do<00:04:42.969> the

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
from the blowpipe and then we'll do the

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.879 
from the blowpipe and then we'll do the
opening<00:04:43.569> sequence<00:04:43.779> once<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:44.469> attached<00:04:44.769> to

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
opening sequence once it's attached to

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.299 
opening sequence once it's attached to
the<00:04:44.979> punty<00:04:45.539> with<00:04:46.539> glass<00:04:46.779> blowing<00:04:47.079> it's<00:04:47.319> it's

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:48.309 
the punty with glass blowing it's it's

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.129 
the punty with glass blowing it's it's
always<00:04:49.119> something<00:04:49.449> fresh<00:04:49.719> and<00:04:49.749> always

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
always something fresh and always

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.989 
always something fresh and always
something<00:04:50.409> different<00:04:50.769> so<00:04:51.579> I'm<00:04:51.639> doing<00:04:51.879> it's

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:51.999 
something different so I'm doing it's

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.079 
something different so I'm doing it's
just<00:04:52.089> giving<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.479> slow<00:04:52.959> ass<00:04:53.949> low<00:04:54.249> pressure<00:04:54.729> down

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.089 
just giving a slow ass low pressure down

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.239 
just giving a slow ass low pressure down
towards<00:04:55.569> the<00:04:55.659> floor<00:04:55.799> which<00:04:56.799> is<00:04:56.829> slowly

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
towards the floor which is slowly

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.129 
towards the floor which is slowly
starting<00:04:57.459> to<00:04:57.789> draw<00:04:58.149> the<00:04:58.209> mouth<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.809> the<00:04:58.869> bowl

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
starting to draw the mouth of the bowl

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.259 
starting to draw the mouth of the bowl
open<00:04:59.619> so<00:05:00.009> ideally<00:05:00.399> we're<00:05:00.579> trying<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.029> get<00:05:01.149> it

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:01.269 
open so ideally we're trying to get it

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:04.939 
open so ideally we're trying to get it
to<00:05:01.360> open<00:05:01.419> up<00:05:02.369> wider<00:05:03.369> than<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.789> base

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
to open up wider than the base

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.989 
to open up wider than the base
glassblowing<00:05:05.949> is<00:05:06.069> different<00:05:06.459> than<00:05:06.639> anything

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:06.999 
glassblowing is different than anything

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.119

going<00:05:20.019> to<00:05:20.079> get<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.259> really<00:05:20.409> hot<00:05:20.679> and<00:05:20.829> start<00:05:21.069> to

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:21.189 
going to get it really hot and start to

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.729 
going to get it really hot and start to
spin<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.969> that's<00:05:22.839> when<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.139> bowl<00:05:23.439> is<00:05:23.589> going

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:23.739 
spin and that's when the bowl is going

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.339 
spin and that's when the bowl is going
to<00:05:23.799> take<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.129> final<00:05:24.399> shape<00:05:24.989> anything<00:05:25.989> that

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
to take the final shape anything that

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.559 
to take the final shape anything that
you<00:05:26.499> want<00:05:27.009> you<00:05:27.249> can<00:05:27.339> create<00:05:27.519> other<00:05:27.729> glass<00:05:27.999> so

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
you want you can create other glass so

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.429 
you want you can create other glass so
we're<00:05:28.689> just<00:05:28.719> going<00:05:29.019> to<00:05:29.139> get<00:05:29.199> it<00:05:29.319> to<00:05:29.409> about

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
we're just going to get it to about

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.879 
we're just going to get it to about
straight<00:05:30.159> sided<00:05:30.689> this<00:05:31.689> is<00:05:31.839> the<00:05:32.019> final<00:05:32.469> heat<00:05:32.679> as

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
straight sided this is the final heat as

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.409 
straight sided this is the final heat as
it<00:05:32.949> gets<00:05:33.459> hotter<00:05:33.699> I'm<00:05:33.969> going<00:05:34.089> to<00:05:34.149> start<00:05:34.299> to

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
it gets hotter I'm going to start to

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.089 
it gets hotter I'm going to start to
spin<00:05:34.719> faster<00:05:35.079> and<00:05:35.619> what<00:05:35.739> happens<00:05:36.009> a

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
spin faster and what happens a

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.459 
spin faster and what happens a
centrifugal<00:05:36.549> force<00:05:36.999> sends<00:05:37.869> the<00:05:38.019> mouth<00:05:38.229> of<00:05:38.409> the

centrifugal force sends the mouth of the

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.439 
centrifugal force sends the mouth of the

bowl away from the center access point

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.540 
bowl away from the center access point
which<00:05:40.839> will<00:05:41.050> just<00:05:41.229> slowly<00:05:41.529> start<00:05:41.979> to<00:05:42.039> flare

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
which will just slowly start to flare

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.309 
which will just slowly start to flare
the<00:05:42.789> bowl<00:05:43.029> and<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.719> can't<00:05:43.989> feel<00:05:44.199> the

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
the bowl and you can't feel the

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.049 
the bowl and you can't feel the
temperature<00:05:44.559> through<00:05:45.339> the<00:05:45.429> camera<00:05:45.819> but<00:05:45.939> it's

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:46.059 
temperature through the camera but it's

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.149 
temperature through the camera but it's
getting<00:05:46.179> a<00:05:46.300> little<00:05:46.419> warmer<00:05:46.839> in<00:05:46.959> here<00:05:47.099> now<00:05:48.099> I'm

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
getting a little warmer in here now I'm

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.979 
getting a little warmer in here now I'm
going<00:05:48.279> to<00:05:48.339> spin<00:05:48.639> faster<00:05:48.999> and<00:05:49.629> you<00:05:49.689> see<00:05:49.899> the

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:49.989 
going to spin faster and you see the

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:52.199 
going to spin faster and you see the
mouth<00:05:50.229> of<00:05:50.409> the<00:05:50.469> bowl<00:05:50.739> starts<00:05:51.219> to<00:05:51.459> spin<00:05:51.849> open

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.209 
mouth of the bowl starts to spin open

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.629 
mouth of the bowl starts to spin open
almost<00:05:52.869> to<00:05:52.989> the<00:05:53.079> point<00:05:53.289> of<00:05:53.439> like<00:05:53.649> a<00:05:53.679> plate<00:05:54.189> then

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
almost to the point of like a plate then

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.519 
almost to the point of like a plate then
what<00:05:54.849> I'll<00:05:54.939> do<00:05:55.089> is<00:05:55.209> I'll<00:05:55.329> come<00:05:55.599> out<00:05:55.779> I'll<00:05:55.989> spin

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
what I'll do is I'll come out I'll spin

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.369 
what I'll do is I'll come out I'll spin
spin<00:05:56.860> spin<00:05:57.159> angle<00:05:58.029> down<00:05:58.209> slightly<00:05:58.659> and<00:05:59.019> now

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
spin spin angle down slightly and now

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.919 
spin spin angle down slightly and now
slow<00:05:59.829> my<00:06:00.069> turn<00:06:00.309> down<00:06:00.550> some<00:06:00.909> which<00:06:01.689> will

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:01.929 
slow my turn down some which will

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.469 
slow my turn down some which will
collapse<00:06:02.529> the<00:06:02.769> bowl<00:06:02.949> a<00:06:02.979> little<00:06:03.429> bit<00:06:03.610> giving<00:06:04.360> it

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
collapse the bowl a little bit giving it

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.989 
collapse the bowl a little bit giving it
just<00:06:04.809> a<00:06:04.929> slight<00:06:05.409> waviness<00:06:05.860> to<00:06:06.189> the<00:06:06.309> mouth<00:06:06.729> of

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:06.999 
just a slight waviness to the mouth of

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.079 
just a slight waviness to the mouth of
it<00:06:07.229> every<00:06:08.229> day<00:06:08.259> I<00:06:08.409> hit<00:06:08.619> on<00:06:08.739> something

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
it every day I hit on something

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.579 
it every day I hit on something
something<00:06:10.089> different<00:06:10.539> or<00:06:10.989> I'll<00:06:11.139> spend<00:06:11.379> a<00:06:11.439> day

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
something different or I'll spend a day

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.289 
something different or I'll spend a day
making<00:06:12.069> stuff<00:06:12.429> that<00:06:12.639> I'm<00:06:12.759> not<00:06:12.879> happy<00:06:13.149> about

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:13.299 
making stuff that I'm not happy about

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.089 
making stuff that I'm not happy about
sometimes<00:06:14.199> that's<00:06:14.349> the<00:06:14.439> best<00:06:14.499> way<00:06:14.799> to<00:06:14.860> find

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
sometimes that's the best way to find

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.769 
sometimes that's the best way to find
stuff<00:06:15.429> that's<00:06:15.669> crazy<00:06:15.999> and<00:06:16.119> different<00:06:16.269> is<00:06:16.599> i'll

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
stuff that's crazy and different is i'll

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.329 
stuff that's crazy and different is i'll
be<00:06:16.899> making<00:06:17.049> something<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:17.799> i<00:06:17.829> made<00:06:18.069> all<00:06:18.219> the

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
be making something that i made all the

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.549 
be making something that i made all the
time<00:06:18.549> and<00:06:18.789> i'll<00:06:19.659> see<00:06:19.899> something<00:06:20.259> in<00:06:20.379> it<00:06:20.469> and

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:20.559 
time and i'll see something in it and

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:22.979 
time and i'll see something in it and
i'll<00:06:20.709> follow<00:06:21.249> that<00:06:21.729> direction<00:06:21.879> and<00:06:22.329> you<00:06:22.869> know

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:22.989 
i'll follow that direction and you know

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:24.869 
i'll follow that direction and you know
run<00:06:23.499> with<00:06:23.679> it<00:06:23.709> and<00:06:23.889> sometimes<00:06:24.369> that's<00:06:24.639> when<00:06:24.819> i

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
run with it and sometimes that's when i

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.509 
run with it and sometimes that's when i
come<00:06:25.629> onto<00:06:25.959> my<00:06:26.349> most<00:06:26.559> interesting<00:06:27.039> stuff<00:06:27.309> is

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:27.519 
come onto my most interesting stuff is

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.049 
come onto my most interesting stuff is
just<00:06:27.969> following<00:06:28.509> a<00:06:28.569> glass<00:06:28.749> wherever<00:06:29.199> it<00:06:29.319> leads

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
just following a glass wherever it leads

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.389 
just following a glass wherever it leads
we<00:06:31.059> get<00:06:31.179> a<00:06:31.239> little<00:06:31.360> water<00:06:31.719> on<00:06:31.869> the<00:06:32.139> tools<00:06:32.409> which

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:33.399 
we get a little water on the tools which

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.839 
we get a little water on the tools which
I<00:06:33.519> touchdown<00:06:34.379> right<00:06:35.379> behind<00:06:35.739> the<00:06:36.009> piece<00:06:36.279> to

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
I touchdown right behind the piece to

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.679 
I touchdown right behind the piece to
Ariane<00:06:37.239> lift<00:06:37.539> it<00:06:37.659> off

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
Ariane lift it off

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.850 
Ariane lift it off
and<00:06:39.110> I<00:06:39.139> give<00:06:39.259> a<00:06:39.289> little<00:06:39.469> tap<00:06:39.739> and<00:06:41.619> then<00:06:42.619> we<00:06:42.739> go

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
and I give a little tap and then we go

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.979 
and I give a little tap and then we go
put<00:06:43.129> it<00:06:43.219> into<00:06:43.519> the<00:06:43.549> annealing<00:06:44.149> oven<00:06:44.449> to<00:06:44.779> cool

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:44.989 
put it into the annealing oven to cool

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:48.159 
put it into the annealing oven to cool
slowly<00:06:45.639> what<00:06:46.639> I'm<00:06:46.759> trying<00:06:47.029> to<00:06:47.059> do<00:06:47.239> is<00:06:47.269> make<00:06:47.809> art

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
slowly what I'm trying to do is make art

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.889 
slowly what I'm trying to do is make art
make<00:06:48.889> stuff<00:06:49.129> that's<00:06:49.339> unique<00:06:49.669> and<00:06:49.879> I<00:06:50.539> try<00:06:50.779> not

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899
