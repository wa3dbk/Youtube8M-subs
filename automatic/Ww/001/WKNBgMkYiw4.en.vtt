what's up YouTube my name is Kenneth
today<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> new<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:03.210> guys

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
today I have a new video for you guys

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.030 
today I have a new video for you guys
it's<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:04.110> bit<00:00:04.230> different<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.859> hope

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
it's a little bit different and I hope

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.350 
it's a little bit different and I hope
you<00:00:05.160> enjoy<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:06.770> so<00:00:07.770> here<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.580> brain<00:00:08.940> cube

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
you enjoy it so here is my brain cube

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.280 
you enjoy it so here is my brain cube
inside<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.469> jar<00:00:11.309> head<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.170> an

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
inside a jar head and so this is an

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.829 
inside a jar head and so this is an
impossible<00:00:13.620> jar<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.820> means<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.360> cube

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
impossible jar and that means the cube

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
impossible jar and that means the cube
itself<00:00:16.260> won't<00:00:16.410> fit<00:00:16.830> through<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.220> neck<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
itself won't fit through the neck of the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
itself won't fit through the neck of the
jar<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> only<00:00:18.810> way<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> cube<00:00:19.710> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
jar and the only way to get the cube in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
jar and the only way to get the cube in
there<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> actually<00:00:21.359> put<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
there is to actually put it in there and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
there is to actually put it in there and
pieces<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> assemble<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> puzzle

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
pieces and then to assemble the puzzle

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.599 
pieces and then to assemble the puzzle
and<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.529> secret<00:00:25.920> behind<00:00:26.189> this

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
and that's the secret behind this

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
and that's the secret behind this
impossible<00:00:27.240> jar<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.689> I've<00:00:28.230> seen<00:00:28.529> many<00:00:28.769> other

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
impossible jar and I've seen many other

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
impossible jar and I've seen many other
impossible<00:00:29.550> jars<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.939> Rubik's<00:00:30.330> cubes

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
impossible jars with Rubik's cubes

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
impossible jars with Rubik's cubes
before<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.109> I've<00:00:31.230> always<00:00:31.500> wanted<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.340> one

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
before and I've always wanted to do one

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
before and I've always wanted to do one
couldn't<00:00:33.270> find<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.660> jar<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
couldn't find a jar that would be the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400 
couldn't find a jar that would be the
perfect<00:00:35.190> size<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:36.290> Rubik's<00:00:37.290> Cube

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
perfect size for a Rubik's Cube

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.729 
perfect size for a Rubik's Cube
impossible<00:00:38.219> jar<00:00:38.430> anyway<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> saw<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.230> jar<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
impossible jar anyway I saw this jar of

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.049 
impossible jar anyway I saw this jar of
as<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:40.980> brothers<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.610> saw<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
as my brothers and I saw it and I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
as my brothers and I saw it and I
thought<00:00:42.329> hey<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> might<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
thought hey that might actually be the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.560 
thought hey that might actually be the
perfect<00:00:44.070> size<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.730> impossible<00:00:45.120> jar<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
perfect size for an impossible jar and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
perfect size for an impossible jar and
sure<00:00:46.230> enough<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.559> tried<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> couldn't<00:00:47.219> put<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sure enough I tried I couldn't put a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
sure enough I tried I couldn't put a
Rubik's<00:00:48.030> Cube<00:00:48.120> through<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> neck<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
Rubik's Cube through the neck of this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.200 
Rubik's Cube through the neck of this
jar<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> knew<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> could<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> pieces

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
jar but I knew I could get the pieces

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
jar but I knew I could get the pieces
inside<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.980> knew<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
inside of it and so then I knew I was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.209 
inside of it and so then I knew I was
gonna<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.910> an<00:00:54.030> impossible<00:00:54.210> jar<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
gonna make an impossible jar with this

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
gonna make an impossible jar with this
crazy-looking<00:00:56.219> head<00:00:56.850> jar<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
crazy-looking head jar then and the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
crazy-looking head jar then and the
question<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.680> cube<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
question was what cube to use and of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
question was what cube to use and of
course<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> correct<00:01:01.739> cube<00:01:02.100> right

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
course this is the correct cube right

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.600 
course this is the correct cube right
that<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> brain<00:01:02.940> cube<00:01:03.329> made<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> perfect

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
that the brain cube made for the perfect

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.090 
that the brain cube made for the perfect
impossible<00:01:05.610> jar<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> went<00:01:07.860> ahead<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
impossible jar and so I went ahead and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
impossible jar and so I went ahead and
did<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> pieces<00:01:09.030> inside<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
did it I put the pieces inside and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.420 
did it I put the pieces inside and
assembled<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.040> very<00:01:11.070> difficult

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
assembled it and it was very difficult

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.789 
assembled it and it was very difficult
to<00:01:11.700> assemble<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:13.229> hand<00:01:13.439> does<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.590> fit

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to assemble because my hand does it fit

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
to assemble because my hand does it fit
through<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> door<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> brain<00:01:14.909> cube<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> very

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
through the door and brain cube is very

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
through the door and brain cube is very
stiff<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> stuff<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.710> anyways

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
stiff and stuff like that so anyways

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
stiff and stuff like that so anyways
very<00:01:17.220> difficult<00:01:17.580> once<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> cube<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
very difficult once I got the cube in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
very difficult once I got the cube in
there<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.110> wanted<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.590> suspended<00:01:20.310> as

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
there I really wanted it suspended as

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.810 
there I really wanted it suspended as
you<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.680> suspend<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.490> cube

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you see it here and to suspend the cube

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
you see it here and to suspend the cube
up<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> did<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.650> got<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
up there what I did was I got a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
up there what I did was I got a
transparent<00:01:27.119> ruler<00:01:27.420> similar<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> one

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
transparent ruler similar to this one

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.280 
transparent ruler similar to this one
and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.189> resized<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.180> ruler<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> dremel

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and I resized the ruler with a dremel

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.490 
and I resized the ruler with a dremel
and<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.369> able<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.810> stick<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> ruler<00:01:34.290> up

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and I was able to stick the ruler up

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
and I was able to stick the ruler up
into<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> head<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> brain<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
into the head and into the brain and I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.410 
into the head and into the brain and I
was<00:01:37.229> able<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> hold<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> brain<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
was able to hold the brain up and so you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.960 
was able to hold the brain up and so you
can<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> ruler<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
can see the ruler there and it's

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
can see the ruler there and it's
semi-transparent<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.119> wish<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.049> didn't<00:01:43.290> have

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
semi-transparent I wish it didn't have

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.780 
semi-transparent I wish it didn't have
the<00:01:43.590> numbers<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> still<00:01:44.520> looks

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the numbers on it but it still looks

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760
