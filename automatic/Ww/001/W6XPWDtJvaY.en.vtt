00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
compared to a pencil and I actually have

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.260 
compared to a pencil and I actually have
the<00:00:32.710> opposite<00:00:33.160> problem<00:00:33.400> where<00:00:33.699> I'm<00:00:33.850> more

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
stretched and that's kind of a going to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.840 
stretched and that's kind of a going to
be<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.110> tough<00:01:20.430> visual<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.270> cell

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
okay so here I'm trying to do the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.870 
okay so here I'm trying to do the
translucent<00:01:33.410> cloth<00:01:33.620> again<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.730> see<00:01:34.850> I

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
translucent cloth again you can see I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.530 
translucent cloth again you can see I
already<00:01:35.360> painted<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.050> arm<00:01:36.230> under<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.920> cloth

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
already painted the arm under the cloth

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.060 
already painted the arm under the cloth
and<00:01:38.540> that's<00:01:39.200> going<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.410> help<00:01:39.470> me<00:01:39.620> out<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.770> lot

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
and that's going to help me out a lot

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.060 
and that's going to help me out a lot
because<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.760> can<00:01:40.910> just<00:01:41.120> add<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.070> more

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
because then I can just add on the more

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.580 
because then I can just add on the more
opaque<00:01:43.460> areas<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.240> cloth<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.930> will

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
opaque areas of the cloth and it will

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.400 
opaque areas of the cloth and it will
give<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> illusion<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.369> transparency

did<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:14.500> my<00:02:14.740> sketch<00:02:15.580> demo<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.590> hopefully

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
did with my sketch demo so hopefully

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.320 
did with my sketch demo so hopefully
you're<00:02:18.040> able<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.280> learn<00:02:18.460> something<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.060> had

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
you're able to learn something and had

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.470 
you're able to learn something and had
