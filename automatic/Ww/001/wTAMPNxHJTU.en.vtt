00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
there trying to figure out how you

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.580 
there trying to figure out how you
integrate<00:03:58.600> how<00:03:58.780> do<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.989> come<00:03:59.170> up<00:03:59.200> with<00:03:59.350> these

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
at the core of what we're doing makes it
