 Good people, I'll continue with the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.860
 bm configuration 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.020
 I will not now show how the 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.950
 I set the radio 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 and how do I configure the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.230
 new flight 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.780
 Ah I can do 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 was the original of the radio in the case here 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.710
 that I'm using is a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.500
 do it falls 9 x which is equal to levy too 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.490
 not x 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.590
 and other radios more than the father-in-law's name 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.320
 with the original how do we do 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.440
 with standard comfort 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.830
 The original is I'm going to teach people 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.300
 you do and up to four 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.350
 flight 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.299
 it's a combination of tea 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.380
 So fly the first thing I go 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.280
 teach us how we have to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.290
 set the radio so here's what 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.490
 project was already leaves open he is 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.740
 disconnected then the first thing to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 publish this radio configuration and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 two modes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.619
 it can only be done 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.479
 using the usb a usb cable 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.750
 no use can not be made with 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:50.450
 even because the usb cable 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.319
 he feeds the stuffed radio then from here 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.170
 I have no gps and got even more 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.899

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.880
 these markers here on the radio you 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.130
 They'll see if I squeeze and you have to 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.940
 move extinct and buttons to the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.840
 final for power 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.300
 to do this calibration so let's 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.000
 there I'll show you 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.180

 maximum of it 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.790
 Oprah left right I turn him like 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.720

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.840
 I'm going to another pit then 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.710
 because not all types and for all 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.379
 That is why it is important to all teams 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.139
 everything has to be centralized and odor 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:03.300

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:20.909
 Well, we'll have the calibration here. 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.340
 of the modes of theft this is important and 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.669
 has a great 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.550
 There is what I left stabilizes that has 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.849
 that having the terminals is the first and 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.729
 people 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.889
