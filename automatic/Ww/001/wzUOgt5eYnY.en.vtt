00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Here we go in general chery amulet 16 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.660
 the video will be about how to change 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.580
 antifreeze without removing the connections 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.769
 radiator that is not according to the instructions 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 and did not climb under the car so that it was 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 easy and simple to allow 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.170
 you replace the thermostat like us this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.430
 the car 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.990
 to replace the thermostat we need 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.980
 disable temperature sensor 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 unscrew the three bolts and remove the case 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 thermostat inside thermostat stands 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 completely take out pull thermos 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 put a new there is this but there the whole 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 the day of those of us so that it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.960
 make we need to drain completely 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 engine fluid as completely as possible 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 here for this we do we connect here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 these two pipes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.050
 a pair of vot para branch pipe which 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.969
 went to the thermostat we shoot there 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.610
 there is no liquid in it, that is, it may not 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.879
 afraid to immediately shoot and drop in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.030
 bottle 2 nozzle 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.470
 we remove from it maybe a little bit truth 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.689
 flow well, in general, you see, there is no 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 we take plastered compressor which we swing 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:23.340
 wheels and so we dress them 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.159
 simple nozzle on the hose ochku all 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.079
 put the compressor we have connected to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
 12 volt battery is the easiest 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.979
 it's not a problem to find now with a pump 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.720
 but I thought the pump will suffer to leave 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.000
 a slide would be much easier for the compressor 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.110
 one lowered there one hooked up 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.510
 which the discharge compressor 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.580
 for this 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 need two people or one who 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.910
 come up with two plugs here but we 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.710
 in two lazy because one person will 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.990
 close these two tubules and thereby 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.480
 by the way slightly regulate the pressure in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 in general, but sometimes you need to turn it off 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.350
 turn on and off but generally we start 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 come maybe close your close your until 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.890
 crush and not be loud of course make noise 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:22.110
 this compressor but nonetheless 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.830
 go, go somewhere, something turned off 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 I am here for us 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.580
 in this passes through 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.390
 here I am showing you 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 the ceiling can be seen 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.410
 that's how he 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 muted 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.010
 and that is how they knock down the supports 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.549
 giant greenhouses 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.430
 look hot when you arrive 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:53.019
 so as not to burn yourself well and not to breathe it 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:58.420
 couples will continue to write a bit in general 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:06.340
 here it merges and watch rises 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:08.909
 rises rises on the computer 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.909
 made by 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 in Lithuania in this way in two 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.980
 glove just keeps do not worry 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.170
 fingers holding a burnt hand band 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.240
 nozzle method styler all it merges 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.340
 sometimes you can let it cool 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.560
 that is, there for 5 minutes you all 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.660
 will merge it is necessary to turn off the compressor 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.110
 old lady it really will be air 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.130
 lot 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.130
 then again 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.110
 because like that would not do 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.970
 now he has a lot of air 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:05.090
 try this left yes did not run out 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:09.520
 Shuklin antifreeze stinks and stinky hole 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:16.340
 and take offense 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:18.650
 or we prick now air slightly will leave 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.350
 well, because you are pushing again 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.210
 some sort of let it match there so on 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:30.830
 Well, that is, if you need matches. people 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:32.510
 Immediately begin to overlap so that's 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.490
 the way it merges you stands a literally 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.500
 a little bit of fluid in the engine itself 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.840
 there are about a liter somewhere there are a few 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.040
 once merged it turns out to merge order 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.390
 five six centuries 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.120
 through the lower radiator hose 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.580
 you'll see it all in the basement itself in the garage 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.160
 and because it does not work properly 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.620
 we don't have traffic jams for draining 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.540
 that's the way to easily and merge her own 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.010
 the radiator is worth all the same and not to 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.740
 climb not suffer this scheme 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.090
 so on came five minutes spent u 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.040
 You are interested in 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.880
 way 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:19.479
 merge we have already merged order somewhere 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.479
 3 liters still come here like this 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.080
 went with new forces 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.710
 a stupid 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.699
 that's all he quickly removed and all 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.699
 thank you for your attention
