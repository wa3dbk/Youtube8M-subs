and<00:00:26.500> also<00:00:27.070> cut<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:28.119> main<00:00:28.689> trunk<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.470> was

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
and also cut the main trunk it was

getting very tall and was very thin not
quite<00:00:36.100> sure<00:00:36.130> if<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:36.969> was<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.180> right<00:00:37.329> thing<00:00:37.390> to

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
you close up this is where the stem was

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.290 
you close up this is where the stem was
cut<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:09.390> new<00:01:11.010> chute<00:01:12.010> developed<00:01:12.550> from<00:01:12.970> just

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
cut and a new chute developed from just

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.520 
cut and a new chute developed from just
below<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.690> cut<00:01:13.930> as<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.490> see<00:01:15.730> here<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.570> is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
below the cut as you can see here and is

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.930 
below the cut as you can see here and is
quite<00:01:18.660> tall<00:01:19.660> and<00:01:20.050> has<00:01:20.500> developed<00:01:20.800> about<00:01:21.280> half

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
quite tall and has developed about half

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.010 
quite tall and has developed about half
a<00:01:22.060> dozen<00:01:22.180> leaves

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.440 

because<00:01:27.770> as<00:01:28.100> I'm<00:01:28.310> saying<00:01:28.520> doing<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> toughness

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
because as I'm saying doing a toughness

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.050 
because as I'm saying doing a toughness
leaves<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.110> also<00:01:30.440> there<00:01:31.159> are<00:01:31.570> new<00:01:32.570> shoots

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
leaves and also there are new shoots

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.800 
leaves and also there are new shoots
developing<00:01:35.060> along<00:01:38.740> X<00:01:39.740> here<00:01:40.100> along<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:41.509> bed

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
developing along X here along this bed

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.469 
developing along X here along this bed
and<00:01:42.049> there's<00:01:42.290> also<00:01:42.530> some<00:01:43.009> growth<00:01:43.880> going<00:01:44.300> on

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
and there's also some growth going on

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.770 
and there's also some growth going on
between<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.200> leaves<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.610> Mane's<00:01:47.450> of

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
between the leaves and the Mane's of

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.310 
between the leaves and the Mane's of
stem<00:01:48.440> their<00:01:49.399> nodes<00:01:49.700> which<00:01:50.000> are<00:01:50.180> appear<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.170> be

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
stem their nodes which are appear to be

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:02.660 
stem their nodes which are appear to be
coming<00:01:51.470> alive<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:53.990> close<00:01:54.229> there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360 

and<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.420> have<00:02:04.630> all<00:02:04.960> five<00:02:05.620> trees<00:02:05.980> together

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
and here we have all five trees together

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.570 
and here we have all five trees together
and<00:02:06.690> some<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.810> them<00:02:08.020> have<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:09.000> number<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:11.580> trunks

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and some of them have a number of trunks

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.940 
and some of them have a number of trunks
and<00:02:13.210> it's<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> clump<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.410> one<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.830> about

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and it's like a clump this one is about

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.170 
and it's like a clump this one is about
four<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.110> has<00:02:20.380> three<00:02:21.000> another<00:02:22.000> one

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
side and this one seems to have the most

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.660 
side and this one seems to have the most
which<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.270> two<00:02:31.960> three<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.970> five<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:36.400> not

which is one two three and five is not
about<00:02:37.000> five<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:43.510> watch<00:02:43.720> further<00:02:44.380> progression

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
about five to watch further progression

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.000 
about five to watch further progression
of<00:02:45.550> these<00:02:45.820> mango<00:02:46.480> trees<00:02:46.690> growing<00:02:47.260> from<00:02:47.500> seed
