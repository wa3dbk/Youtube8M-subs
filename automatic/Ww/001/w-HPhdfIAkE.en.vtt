00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 I got a serious fit of laughter 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.910
 unlikely to come up with such a mural 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.830
 also more than 50 years that nobody 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.830
 I found a mural so well preserved 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.110
 It is one of the two Mayan murals 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 important never found 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.910
 is by far the furthest in the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.730
 time and still his strokes are 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.370
 surprisingly delicate water in the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 arms hear and melt smoothly 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.770
 the values are vibrant people 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.770
 attractive his features seem attractive 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.140
 bill invited the artist header hurst to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.120
 to help him decipher the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.810
 meaning of the mural making a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.480
 exact reproduction 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.050
 this young woman had just spent two years and 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.550
 medium 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.330
 painting the other great mayan mural 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.160
 found in bonampak in 1946 could not 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
 believe me what I had found was not 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.270
 only a mural but a mural before 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.470
 all found to date and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 that had nothing to do with them 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 the weak laboratory is in the old 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.860
 old colonial city in the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.440
 Guatemalan highlands 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.820
 besides accessing it has also brought together 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.300
 two of the greatest experts in 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.520
 Mayan symbolism letter and dave and texture 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.520
 we all leave a promise 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.060
 something that was very clear to me when bill 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.159
 He left the jungle with his first 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.080
 pictures of the mural was that we 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.690
 We found one of the findings 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.390
 most important but the most important 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.790
 of the last 20 or 30 years in the field 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 of mayer studies in terms of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.810
 classic late Mayan this would be a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 Chapel Sistine is a picture about the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.000
 origins and creation 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.729
 I do not think there's any doubt that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.040
 this finding will surely change all 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.110
 our view of what civilization 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.860
 Maya had in mind when creating her area 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.880
 by capturing the vision of their cosmology and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 of the origin of the universe 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.700
 it is a scene from the great myth 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 maya of creation 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.500
 registered 1500 years later in the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.500
 epic story known as dust 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.530

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.050
 this myth tells the story of the god 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.050
 of corn 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.939
 the central deity of the Mayan cosmos 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.719
 responsible for the corn on which it depends 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.719
 lifetime 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.490
 the god of corn descends to the underworld 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.490
 where the lords of death kill him 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.340
 then they place their head on a tree 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.620
 years later their children's heroes 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.730
 twins come back to avenge him and defeat 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.730
 the lords of death 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.280
 resurrected by magic the god of 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.400
 corn comes back to the surface of the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.400

 day of the new world 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.780
 this is a story that obsessed 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.050
 the Mayans of the classical period this is 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.310
 a version painted several centuries before 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.590
 it is not an interpretation 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.310
 primitive but rather of a labor 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.310
 exquisite
