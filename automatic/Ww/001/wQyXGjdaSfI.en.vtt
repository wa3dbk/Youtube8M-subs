 I'm so New Jerseys from GE and that's my sister's so out of her 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.799
 also here and there 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.189
 that is also Marcel usual because this box was 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.849
 and San Francisco also inspired on Make the Street 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.889
 It is also really hard so I hope that you have high quality 

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.460
 Loudspeakers were installed 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
 Everything will now see the same and such a test report 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.400
 Now the technical data is the magic word 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 we have 2 4 woofers in it 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 Ladies 2 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.520
 «Zero comma 7 5 the saying sounds 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.580
 then the 30 dock connector for this year alb-messenger new iPhone 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.930
 then also Bluetooth 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930
 a 3 2 5 millimeter single point for other things 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.320
 and a rope can get you five millimeters microphone four weeks ago 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.720
 lagging behind 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.210
 also usb2 point zero 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 and the more you do the dimensions, then 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.039
 13 centimeters 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.280
 she will be a twenty centimeters and weigh 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.250
 here again 23 cm 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 and now we're taking out the hobbies of their Geopark Mai 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.640
 so it is eg that accessory box 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 It's no different than anything else 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.510
 So we have 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.750
 the power supply many 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.600
 Great Britain 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.430
 because depending on the power supply 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 for Germany 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.180
 let it get caught cold Mercedes was built in 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
 in the second half were the ones with the card 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.960
 and where it hurts but with 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 min Niçoise 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.600
 also hopes for textbooks 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870
 the cellar is Dr 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.270
 he means ours 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.850
 Download Martin Strutz 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.539
 and last but not least lured 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.890
 it is not fair 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.800
 come to us from there 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.189
 with the appropriate we fit batteries 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.189
 and that even resulted in a very heavy run so bit heavy 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.509
 there one waits then already many an agreement 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.109
 with the course of all taxes 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.109
 Even Nu forgive 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.319
 That's it 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 Super 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.379
 also silver 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 It's getting late 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.570
 that's the place a bit sun to about 40 percent its best 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.019
 if they did not give themselves the honor 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.239
 and I have a little closer 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.260
 Jamie Lynn 30 go Dock Connector for yours 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:01.960
 and at the post office 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 did not also test for the device 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.350
 become them 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.349
 the built-in microphone 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.849
 and the Envia it whenever the device is on 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.149
 the current and from around the world 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.749
 There is also a locked one here 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.530
 to stop the music 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.759
 or continue playing 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.620
 Candidate to find a breaker on the back 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.619
 then the microphone output 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.959
 the canvas becomes 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.369
 the usb-ports and of course still 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:35.749
 the impetus for the power supply 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.519
 and new device is via Bluetooth with the Audi Seat to connect them here 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.549
 Press the right button on the back of the back 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.119
 then, as they are visible to new devices for that, I am now simple 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.459
 the pin code is four times the grade 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.669
 and you can transfer music wirelessly 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.519
 the speakers are on the side 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.309
 we have a very deep standing here 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.309
 and here one of the top ten 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.909
 the fiber optic cable 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.909
 No 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.539
 so it is really very loud 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.539
 The theme of many small party is absolutely out 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.009
 and if you have your device 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.770
 the term 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.419
 wirelessly wanted to be forced with the 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.990
 that does not work 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.979
 Keep Trittin and Künast pressed 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.469
 we are very proud 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.449
 like a test 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.379
 but he could be expensive especially calls Herbert 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.680
 be funded 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.919
 be quoted today as saying 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.660
 death is four times the other day i have always been connected so i still have to 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:05.349
 here 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.349
 not connected to the church 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.259
 Be music program 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.909
 what the whole thing already 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 wireless will not be there but collects 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.089
 You can also control the volume 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.889
 I also can here 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 would now also choose whether that then again under control 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:32.879
 models 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.879
 the OECD sees 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.280
 and then over Pluto he said one to Siegert's five to ten radius 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.309
 Meters if I have time 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.110
 located with the e-commerce at Alicante 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.449
 and still if they have no money 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.529
 However, on board there are no worries about Strasser, according to Ressel 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.210
 also urged sour to solve tomorrow 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.310
 but everyone definitely a biotope Cera examines working hours Euro 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.110
 worthless 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.060
 and d 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.620
 in the latest gadgets 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.539
 you also find a way in the EU 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.969
 where did this money come from 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.009
 You can buy in Germany 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.169
