don't know my initial idea was to either

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.289 
don't know my initial idea was to either
tape<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:58.469> velcro<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.009> um<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.969> i<00:02:00.090> could

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
tape it or two velcro it um and i could

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
tape it or two velcro it um and i could
not<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> velcro<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.590> work<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
not get just the velcro to work and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.609 
not get just the velcro to work and
after<00:02:02.189> thinking<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.299> tape

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
after thinking about it the tape

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.420 
after thinking about it the tape
probably<00:02:04.619> isn't<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.100> good<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> an<00:02:05.369> idea

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
probably isn't that good of an idea

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.499 
probably isn't that good of an idea
either<00:02:07.610> with<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.789> mom<00:02:09.030> though<00:02:09.239> you'll<00:02:09.420> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
either with this mom though you'll be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.520 
either with this mom though you'll be
able<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.910> access<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.510> battery<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
able to have access to your battery you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
able to have access to your battery you
be<00:02:13.680> able<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.580> access<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.180> your

be able to have access to your
microphone<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.900> won't<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.430> taped<00:02:17.430> over

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
microphone it won't be taped over

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.440 
microphone it won't be taped over
anything<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.940> best<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.300> all

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
anything like that and the best of all

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.050 
anything like that and the best of all
the<00:02:21.630> ring<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.200> removable<00:02:22.830> from<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> flip<00:02:23.280> now

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the ring is removable from the flip now

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.420 
the ring is removable from the flip now
this<00:02:24.180> does<00:02:24.420> require<00:02:24.600> sticking<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.980> hard

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this does require sticking the hard

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.910 
this does require sticking the hard
plastic<00:02:26.850> side<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.870> velcro<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.530> your<00:02:28.650> flip

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
plastic side of the velcro to your flip

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
plastic side of the velcro to your flip
which<00:02:29.730> isn't<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.300> big<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.600> deal<00:02:30.720> because

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
which isn't that big of a deal because

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
which isn't that big of a deal because
it's<00:02:31.200> easily<00:02:31.470> removable<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.730> might<00:02:32.880> leave

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it's easily removable and I might leave

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.120 
it's easily removable and I might leave
a<00:02:33.420> little<00:02:33.569> bit<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.780> sticky<00:02:34.080> residue<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:34.770> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
a little bit of sticky residue which you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
a little bit of sticky residue which you
can<00:02:35.340> probably<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:37.080> know<00:02:37.170> eventually

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
can probably just you know eventually

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
can probably just you know eventually
just<00:02:37.650> peel<00:02:37.920> off<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.520> um<00:02:38.780> let<00:02:39.780> me<00:02:39.810> explain<00:02:40.110> what

just peel off but um let me explain what

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.000 
just peel off but um let me explain what
I<00:02:40.290> did<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> took<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.660> took<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.900> kid<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
I did I took the I took the kid and it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.380 
I did I took the I took the kid and it
comes<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:44.489> these<00:02:44.640> rings<00:02:45.000> all<00:02:45.270> these

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
comes with all these rings all these

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.050 
comes with all these rings all these
different<00:02:45.660> size<00:02:46.019> Marines<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.890> they're<00:02:47.850> meant

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
different size Marines and they're meant

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.449 
different size Marines and they're meant
for<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.510> use<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> more

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
for to use for you know like a more

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.759 
for to use for you know like a more
professional<00:02:50.730> camera<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.300> guess<00:02:51.620> where<00:02:52.620> you'll

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
professional camera I guess where you'll

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.190 
professional camera I guess where you'll
where<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.519> just<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.690> know<00:02:54.810> take<00:02:55.050> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
where you can just you know take the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.479 
where you can just you know take the
lens<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.600> just<00:02:57.600> screw<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.230> you'd<00:02:59.190> screw

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
lens and just screw it on you'd screw

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.880 
lens and just screw it on you'd screw
the<00:02:59.670> ring<00:03:00.150> onto<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.630> camera<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the ring onto the camera and then the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.880 
the ring onto the camera and then the
lens<00:03:02.100> onto<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.550> ring<00:03:02.760> um<00:03:03.660> as<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.769> all<00:03:04.860> know

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
lens onto the ring um as you all know

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.590 
lens onto the ring um as you all know
the<00:03:05.040> flip<00:03:05.400> does<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.390> capability

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the flip does not have this capability

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.449 
the flip does not have this capability
by<00:03:07.260> default<00:03:07.620> that's<00:03:07.950> why<00:03:08.069> we're<00:03:08.190> doing<00:03:08.280> this

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
by default that's why we're doing this

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.280 
by default that's why we're doing this
mod<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> I'll<00:03:12.030> started<00:03:12.390> out<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.930> hard

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
mod so I'll started out with the hard

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.569 
mod so I'll started out with the hard
side<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.280> velcro<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:16.680> cut<00:03:16.890> around<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
side of the velcro and I cut around the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.300 
side of the velcro and I cut around the
lens<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.620> flip<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.890> actually<00:03:23.190> two

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
lens on the flip so it's actually two

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.590 
lens on the flip so it's actually two
pieces<00:03:23.489> I'll<00:03:23.790> show<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.209> second

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
pieces I'll show you that in a second

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.120 
pieces I'll show you that in a second
because<00:03:24.690> unfortunately<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.769> not<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
because unfortunately I do not have a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.590 
because unfortunately I do not have a
extra<00:03:26.730> camera<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.900> uh<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:29.150> cut<00:03:30.150> around<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
extra camera but uh I cut around it and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.720 
extra camera but uh I cut around it and
I<00:03:30.660> stuck<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:30.930> straight<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.560> flip<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:34.730> this

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
I stuck it straight to the flip and this

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.660 
I stuck it straight to the flip and this
it<00:03:36.090> wasn't<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.420> best<00:03:36.540> idea<00:03:36.720> because<00:03:37.670> actually

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
it wasn't the best idea because actually

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.140 
it wasn't the best idea because actually
I<00:03:38.910> did<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:40.190> soft<00:03:41.190> side<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.930> ring<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
I did the soft side to the ring and the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.380 
I did the soft side to the ring and the
hard<00:03:45.359> side<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.900> camera<00:03:46.350> well<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:48.030> camera

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
hard side to the camera well the camera

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.470 
hard side to the camera well the camera
is<00:03:48.540> slightly<00:03:48.780> curved<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.910> can't<00:03:51.150> stick

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
is slightly curved so you can't stick

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.210 
is slightly curved so you can't stick
you<00:03:51.720> know<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.019> very<00:03:52.230> well<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> slight

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you know this very well to a slight

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.789 
you know this very well to a slight
curve<00:03:53.549> because<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.930> doesn't<00:03:55.170> bend<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.530> doesn't

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
curve because it doesn't bend it doesn't

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.090 
curve because it doesn't bend it doesn't
give<00:03:55.980> easily<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.079> what<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.109> had<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> do<00:03:58.470> next<00:03:58.680> was

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
give easily so what I had to do next was

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.650 
give easily so what I had to do next was
I<00:04:00.530> took<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.709> different<00:04:01.859> ring<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:03.180> took<00:04:03.359> some

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
I took a different ring and I took some

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.170 
I took a different ring and I took some
of<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.840> foam<00:04:04.109> tape<00:04:04.500> stuff<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.760> built<00:04:06.030> up

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
of this foam tape stuff and I built up

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.789 
of this foam tape stuff and I built up
like<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> little<00:04:06.660> washer<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.290> guess<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.709> would

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
like a little washer I guess you would

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.580 
like a little washer I guess you would
call<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:10.310> once<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.430> did<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:12.410> went<00:04:13.410> back

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
call it and once I did that I went back

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.819 
call it and once I did that I went back
to<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.010> soft<00:04:14.640> side<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.500> did<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> same<00:04:16.799> thing

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
to the soft side and did the same thing

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.340 
to the soft side and did the same thing
so<00:04:17.430> now<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:18.329> protrudes<00:04:18.810> out<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.049> little<00:04:19.169> bit

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
so now it protrudes out a little bit

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.550 
so now it protrudes out a little bit
past<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.799> original<00:04:20.519> thread<00:04:20.850> ring<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.659> it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
past the original thread ring and it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.210 
past the original thread ring and it
gives<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.890> little<00:04:23.010> bit<00:04:23.220> more<00:04:23.460> play<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.570> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
gives it a little bit more play on the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220 
gives it a little bit more play on the
only<00:04:26.220> bond<00:04:26.729> there

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
only bond there

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.510 
only bond there
with<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.530> velcro<00:04:28.120> um<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:31.130> works<00:04:31.310> quite

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
with the velcro um and it works quite

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.980 
with the velcro um and it works quite
well<00:04:31.580> I'm<00:04:31.970> actually<00:04:32.090> using<00:04:32.420> it<00:04:32.630> right<00:04:32.810> now<00:04:32.840> I
