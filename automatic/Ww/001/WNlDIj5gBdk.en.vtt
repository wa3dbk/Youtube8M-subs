00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.800
 number 3 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.270
 in this number 3 we are going to good we are going to 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.700
 see how today what is the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.390
 I'm going to record a video which I have to 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.060
 make a challenge 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
 and put your feet and something frozen water 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 with a lot of ice that I have 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.900
 put for the main channel so 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 what he's going to do is teach them to 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.000
 teach them how to teach them 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.500
 the ice that would throw him into what would be 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.700
 America where I'll put my feet that 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.850
 the water must be frozen 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.850
 practically 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.540
 well this is latina where are we going to 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.120
 to throw the water this is quite 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.949
 great as you see there we are going to take the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 water with ice so let's look 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 by ice lime as this is how to focus 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 that what he has done is a piece of this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.489
 having the same it is right here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.990
 what I do is split it this and half 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 of this one because it's enough and then 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 no so I've done these two and the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.659
 Well I would take it out 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.819
 community here 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.609
 and fill up with water at least until 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.229
 here 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.960
 if you can focus with the camera is 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.869
 up here more or less with an amount 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.450
 of ice is that it would be quite that it would be 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.250
 this and half of this one that already 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.740
 practically with that the water is going to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.079
 freeze is already superfluous and good 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.789
 with the video I'm going to record with good and 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.429
 is the grass is the camera of the 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.750
 phone with which he recorded the blogs 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.490
 is the phone camera that good 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.679
 Nor it is wrong to 13 megapixels 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.310
 full hd that you upload the video like this without 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.799
 edit and nothing can be 1080p 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.200
 where are we going to put out not here is 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.039
 where will you go there is a chair 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.159
 I put this test would put this chair that 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.490
 I would put a cloth there and here what would be 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.950
 latina is latina would be something like 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.720
 here and a cloth there for the time that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.450
 I take out the feet that do not get wet and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 get my feet off once I would put the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.400
 camera let's see what would be better 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.340
 as here so that we would have a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.500
 it takes more or less from here then to me yes 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.930
 medium in the water and taxis that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.269
 defocusing which is pretty good 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.250
 real that this camera is blurring I'm going to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.100
 make the phone on this side recording 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.140
 here and well I will not put all the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.780
 video because if it would not be very long it's going to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.410
 put certain parts from here is going to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.210
 be recording what would be 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.100
 good since she is taking the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.790
 main is the case of the channel 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.560
 but this one here 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.360
 simply because it is more or less than 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.939
 I'm meeting the challenge and such that I have 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.150
 that last a minute with your feet with 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:58.239
 other feet and tucked the dosa and 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.489
 connecting sincerity is to procure a 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.709
 minute but my goal is to last two minutes 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.989
 the challenge is up to a minute that also 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.359
 I want a video response from all 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.220
 others that good the ones that gave me the 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.489
 challenge and in those who see them to see who 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.730
 will overcome me and so and so good that 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.469
 that's all let's go let's go to ride 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.290
 I'm going to put the camera over here or 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.689
 minus the camera with the tripod and I have 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.970
 put what would be some light in there I have 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.430
 that pick up that there put a light bulb 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.750
 so there is enough light here for 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.630
 from here if I could see well 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.620
 and well let's move on to what would be the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.620
 torture 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.980
 and the fact 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.569
 but good 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 can compare what lasts 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.870
 start 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.650
 ah 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.280
 and that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.280
 I played 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.060
 at your feet 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.580
 dv 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.139

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.199
 l 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.110
 is 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.110
 only 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.540
