so<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> expecting<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.840> return<00:01:12.990> on

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so when are you expecting a return on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
so when are you expecting a return on
investment<00:01:13.520> well<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.150> return<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
investment well I think the return on

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.740 
investment well I think the return on
investment<00:01:16.009> should<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.189> within<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.750> three

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
investment should be within the three

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.780 
investment should be within the three
years<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.470> say<00:01:19.619> something<00:01:20.070> reasonable

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
years I would say something reasonable

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
years I would say something reasonable
you<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.740> return<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you start to see a good return on

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
you start to see a good return on
investment<00:01:23.640> obviously<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> return<00:01:24.270> on

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
investment obviously the return on

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.270 
investment obviously the return on
investment<00:01:24.570> depends<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> quality<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
investment depends on the quality of the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
investment depends on the quality of the
job<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> done<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.049> teams

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
job which would be done by our teams

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.890

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
understand you know what the conversion

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.649 
understand you know what the conversion
consumers<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:45.180> Russian

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
consumers want and what Russian

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
consumers want and what Russian
consumers<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
consumers do not want and that's why I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.999 
consumers do not want and that's why I
think<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.930> very<00:01:49.140> important<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.549> still

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
think it's very important to still

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.260 
think it's very important to still
strengthen<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.189> brand<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> think

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
strengthen the brand because I think

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.010 
strengthen the brand because I think
Russian<00:01:55.049> consumers<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:56.040> Russian<00:01:56.909> brand<00:01:57.149> but
