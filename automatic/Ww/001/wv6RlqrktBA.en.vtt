00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.690 
it makes the lashes themselves look
longer<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.459> won't<00:02:20.459> say<00:02:20.670> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
longer it's like I won't say that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.970 
longer it's like I won't say that
they're<00:02:20.970> almost<00:02:21.150> hitting<00:02:21.569> my<00:02:21.780> brow<00:02:22.140> bone<00:02:22.470> but

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
they're almost hitting my brow bone but

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.920 
they're almost hitting my brow bone but
they're<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.650> mean<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:27.390> may<00:02:27.599> come

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they're up there so I mean they may come

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.220 
they're up there so I mean they may come
across<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.430> camera<00:02:29.880> okay<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.780> think

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
across on the camera okay but I think

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.910 
across on the camera okay but I think
for<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.250> personal<00:02:32.970> taste<00:02:33.140> they're<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.560> much

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
for my personal taste they're a bit much

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.990 
for my personal taste they're a bit much
for<00:02:36.950> actually<00:02:37.950> walking<00:02:38.340> around<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
for actually walking around in the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.500 
for actually walking around in the
street

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
street

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.430 
street
definitely<00:02:40.140> not<00:02:40.790> daylight<00:02:41.790> now<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:43.170> would

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
definitely not daylight now these would

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.530 
definitely not daylight now these would
look<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:44.040> nice<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.849> were<00:02:45.030> doing<00:02:45.209> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
look really nice if I were doing a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720 
look really nice if I were doing a
really<00:02:45.989> really<00:02:46.140> dramatic<00:02:46.560> look<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.400> camera

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
really really dramatic look on camera

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.690 
really really dramatic look on camera
and<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.410> your<00:02:49.560> eyelashes<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.400> really

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and you want your eyelashes to really

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
and you want your eyelashes to really
stand<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.420> say<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.900> instance<00:02:52.019> if<00:02:52.440> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
stand out like say for instance if you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.110 
stand out like say for instance if you
were<00:02:52.680> doing<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.220> very<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> smoky<00:02:55.590> eye<00:02:56.120> real

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
were doing a very like a smoky eye real

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.630 
were doing a very like a smoky eye real
deep<00:02:57.390> dark<00:02:57.720> smoky<00:02:58.290> eye<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.799> your<00:02:59.370> lashes

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
deep dark smoky eye and your lashes

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.850 
deep dark smoky eye and your lashes
sometimes<00:03:00.360> could<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:01.170> lost<00:03:01.560> in

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
sometimes could get a little lost in

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.309 
sometimes could get a little lost in
that<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.450> would<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.870> good<00:03:04.049> for

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
that I think these would be good for

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.750 
that I think these would be good for
that<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.769> camera<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.950> again<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.549> my

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that on camera I think again for my

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160 
that on camera I think again for my
personal<00:03:09.420> taste<00:03:09.480> um<00:03:10.549> I<00:03:11.690> think<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.019> bit

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
personal taste um I think it's a bit

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.850 
personal taste um I think it's a bit
much<00:03:13.350> for<00:03:13.410> me<00:03:13.739> out<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.730> public<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.650> what<00:03:16.830> I

it but actually guys this is a really

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.330 
it but actually guys this is a really
interesting<00:04:40.600> finish<00:04:41.230> it's<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.620> jelly<00:04:42.070> bean

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
interesting finish it's a jelly bean

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.500 
interesting finish it's a jelly bean
finish<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.930> means<00:04:44.350> it's<00:04:44.620> not<00:04:45.210> shiny<00:04:46.210> at

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
finish so that means it's not shiny at

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.890 
finish so that means it's not shiny at
all<00:04:46.920> it's<00:04:47.920> not<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.520> call<00:04:48.820> we<00:04:49.180> call<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.570> true

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
all it's not what I call we call a true

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.950 
all it's not what I call we call a true
matte<00:04:50.170> but<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.560> more<00:04:50.770> or<00:04:50.920> less<00:04:51.030> like<00:04:52.030> satiny

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
matte but is more or less like satiny

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.900 
matte but is more or less like satiny
it's<00:04:53.230> it's<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.890> finish<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.460> jelly<00:04:54.700> bean

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
it's it's the finish of a jelly bean

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.150 
it's it's the finish of a jelly bean
actually<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.900> that's<00:04:55.990> what<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.380> is<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.710> jelly

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
actually and that's what it is is jelly

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.060 
actually and that's what it is is jelly
bean<00:04:57.400> finished<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.020> that's<00:04:59.020> what<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.710> is

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
bean finished and that's what it is

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.550 
bean finished and that's what it is
so<00:05:00.220> this<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.730> not<00:05:00.940> like<00:05:01.240> really<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.990> true<00:05:02.320> true

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
so this is not like really a true true

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.770 
so this is not like really a true true
representation<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.670> it<00:05:03.820> as<00:05:04.000> far<00:05:04.480> as<00:05:04.540> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
representation of it as far as the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.320 
representation of it as far as the
finish<00:05:05.050> goes<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:06.010> true<00:05:06.340> representation<00:05:06.790> of

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
finish goes is a true representation of

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.790 
finish goes is a true representation of
it<00:05:07.420> as<00:05:07.540> far<00:05:07.720> as<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.930> color<00:05:08.200> but<00:05:08.470> not<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
it as far as the color but not the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.240 
it as far as the color but not the
finish<00:05:09.190> um<00:05:09.810> yeah<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:11.050> enjoyed<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.590> think<00:05:11.830> black
