00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.339
 hello to all of us we find ourselves for the test of who wants to win 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.079
 millions to throw 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.310
 useful millions of units available on the app store 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.929
 for 399 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.300
 eighteen and mines have so that's the game 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 televised that is adapted simply for iphone 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.280
 but obviously 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.960
 the meeting the accession 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.340
 but for now 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.730
 there are comments so cult date date the app really there 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.830
 like what the disappointing 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.940
 we can see the release note that the two three stars 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 because the 500 questions video game 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.560
 and to get a 250 more we will have to pay when we see here 69 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.310
 cents 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.360
 you can have up to a thousand questions what am I doing a hero 59 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.870
 additional purchase 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.620
 so I'll show you the game right now 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 so as we can see we find a very nice interface teeth 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.130
 especially with the home screen 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.210
 as we can see 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.280
 at the bottom we find 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 a scrolling menu 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.720
 so we'll go around now now the instructions that we 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 Explain 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.550
 the rules of the game as we can see here 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.590
 for those who do not know god on the Norman TNT 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.630
 it is at this very moment as well as an adaptation to a pure and simple of the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 Thu 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 we find the settings 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.720
 to play or not with the net cost 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.320
 the small his activity or not 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.380
 the sound settings 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.000
 and to alert him what has been repeated one can also choose his motto as one 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 see him here 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.720
 then 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.310
 there is also 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.590
 online to play online 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.270
 so for leading genlis is that all rankings 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.370
 we can see leaderboard this is the rankings 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.270
 so the game in French can now let bordeaux leader would have 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 could be the ranking simply 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.570
 oh there we see an asset all the people 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 who does not play his game 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.509
 hmm rushed 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 the bonuses ended over which included a scent too 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.659
 and say we're going to play part of the game right now 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.659
 by doing more 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.929
 so each occurrence speed and we rank his parent chains of 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.149
 growth on the controller 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.270
 so the joystick 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.270
 here it is that they are actually weird anyway we have placed 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.499
 tf1 from france 5 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.669
 in addition we pay channel + pass to Frankfurt 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.669
 in the apple-driven 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.339
 but how does that 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.229
 nicolas as you saw so much the settings could best adjust 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.159
 in this question speed 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.109
 you evolved 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.089
 oh that's a good question I do not know 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.049
 gfr 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.209
 the call to a friend so we have the three bonuses that we will find here 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.109
 if we propose three characters 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.229
 still more virtual characters 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.339
 or compote and therefore we would learn chance 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.439
 that we are 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.260
 we that we have recalled franÃ§oise and tells us that she is sure of the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.969
 answer c 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
 so we will listen to it we could trust to master 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.659
 and that's a good answer 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.329
 so as paul lorne lanning are 11 euros so it's totally virtual 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.569
 meyer of the CNI and 30 years the stage it is not money and you 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.229
 receive 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.089
 it's a shame indeed 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.089
 so in as paul evokes the euros group 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.009
 of the ladies' tower 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:43.769
 the usefulness of each article 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 so here are 820 1500 3000 years experts 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.759
 then still the question of leaving the tower 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.599
 1500 will have so this is the first tier then the question m which of these terms 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.579
 is synonymous with joyful 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.680
 by his target 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.219
 a very good question that m 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.089
 I will do 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.609
 the public vote 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.929
 so the public will vote 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:09.769
 and say that the answer gold 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.189
 and 161 70% 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.189
 we will trust them 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.870
 so the audience who can over to the inverted 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.870
 so there you hear 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.389
 music level crossing one she's a little remixed for 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.229
 the application is a severe mouth like that 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.639
 then belgium luxembourg and the netherlands constitutes the 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.969
 claas a question still very difficult 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.650
 I will appeal 11 55 antitheft andr bad answers 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.439
 and over there 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.570
 this is for the observation 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.960
 bennink 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.590
 it's a replica 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.090
 3000 euros 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.029
 bruno liar 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.710
 in the yan troupe 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.749
 as we can see 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:05.340
 the eastern term dmc which is located north at ease to the south or to 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.009
 west 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.960
 but obviously this game is good for the family 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.789
 to answer questions you ask questions it's the same 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.010
 as for example here we will answer 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.010
 at the same time she will have to answer but gets countered 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.059
 it's a shame that the answer was his father's advice 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.759
 I lost and I fall back to 1500 soldiers 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.330
 after the game that was required a main menu 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.009
 I could have a culture animation a little better because there we 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.279
 therefore expects a higher in three points 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.300
 we are waiting for something better 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.949
 concerning transport 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.120
 it is also said 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.790
 not very busy apart from them 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.020
 this middle of the music to that 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.789
 we also find after winning the 500 questions that come in you 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.029
 have the shop 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.029
 to buy in-app purchases 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.039
 as we can see here why buy 69 cents chaining our 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.849
 closest friends not very helpful on this issue it's already not bad 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.919
 then she points to this world 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.459
 similarity warrant 168 years old mickey settled 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.919
 and that's where we want to buy more I'm going now 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.919
 in the absence of years it is already enough 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.900
 but that's it for tyler innis text millions buy palpable version 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.910
 thank you all for watching this video and I'll see you soon 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.259
 on the sidelines
