00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
ness says maybe try to create more

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.170 
ness says maybe try to create more
opportunities<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.459> team<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.850> stuff<00:03:22.030> to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
opportunities for the team and stuff to

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.000 
opportunities for the team and stuff to
look<00:03:22.300> for<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.540> pain<00:03:22.780> or<00:03:22.930> something<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
look for a pain or something and in the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.430 
look for a pain or something and in the
end<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.570> usually<00:03:25.570> not<00:03:25.600> when<00:03:25.900> Russell's<00:03:26.350> his

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
end it's usually not when Russell's his

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.340 
end it's usually not when Russell's his
best<00:03:26.680> but<00:03:27.040> he's<00:03:27.130> always<00:03:27.340> come<00:03:27.670> through<00:03:27.940> so

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
best but he's always come through so

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.140 
best but he's always come through so
he's<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.380> guy<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:30.400> have<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.580> hard<00:03:30.880> percent

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
he's a guy that we have a hard percent

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.370 
he's a guy that we have a hard percent
confidence<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.810> think<00:03:31.870> he's<00:03:32.080> got<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> make

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
confidence in I think he's got to make

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.199 
confidence in I think he's got to make
adjustments<00:03:32.500> more<00:03:33.130> as<00:03:33.310> far<00:03:33.520> as<00:03:33.670> getting<00:03:34.030> his

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
adjustments more as far as getting his

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.090 
adjustments more as far as getting his
hands<00:03:34.450> where<00:03:34.600> he<00:03:34.660> wants<00:03:34.959> him<00:03:35.020> being<00:03:35.920> more

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
hands where he wants him being more

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.420 
hands where he wants him being more
basic<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:37.300> he<00:03:37.840> does<00:03:37.990> those<00:03:38.170> things<00:03:38.200> he's<00:03:38.740> he's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
basic and he does those things he's he's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.880 
basic and he does those things he's he's
very<00:03:39.970> very<00:03:40.060> hard<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.540> beat<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.560> could<00:03:41.709> be<00:03:41.770> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
very very hard to beat so it could be a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.290 
very very hard to beat so it could be a
good<00:03:42.070> thing<00:03:42.130> it's<00:03:42.459> really<00:03:42.700> enough<00:03:42.850> for<00:03:43.120> him

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
good thing it's really enough for him

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.490 
good thing it's really enough for him
that<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.540> think<00:03:43.780> it's<00:03:43.930> some<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.260> kind<00:03:44.440> of

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
that I think it's some that kind of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.050 
that I think it's some that kind of
reminds<00:03:44.860> him<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.040> he<00:03:45.250> needs<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.520> take<00:03:45.790> that

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
reminds him that he needs to take that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.030 
reminds him that he needs to take that
and<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.810> very<00:03:46.989> disciplined<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:47.620> areas

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and be very disciplined in those areas

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.140 
and be very disciplined in those areas
because<00:03:48.459> that's<00:03:48.610> always<00:03:48.790> when<00:03:49.000> he's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
because that's always when he's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.570 
because that's always when he's
competing<00:03:49.870> at<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:49.989> highest<00:03:50.140> level<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.920> so

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
competing at the highest level and so

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.979 
competing at the highest level and so
that's<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.180> thing<00:03:52.330> we're<00:03:52.480> focused<00:03:52.810> on<00:03:52.870> with

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
that's the thing we're focused on with

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.330 
that's the thing we're focused on with
him<00:03:53.140> that's<00:03:53.350> kind<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.530> what<00:03:53.650> we<00:03:53.770> told<00:03:53.950> him<00:03:54.130> and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
him that's kind of what we told him and

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.130 
him that's kind of what we told him and
so<00:03:54.489> those<00:03:54.610> adjustments<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.480> we<00:03:55.840> look<00:03:55.989> for

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
so those adjustments that we look for

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.140 
so those adjustments that we look for
him<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.320> make<00:03:56.489> between<00:03:57.489> now<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.850> then<00:03:57.940> when

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
him to make between now and then when

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.430 
him to make between now and then when
he's<00:03:58.300> rustling<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> best<00:03:58.989> guys<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
he's rustling the best guys in the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.130 
he's rustling the best guys in the
country<00:03:59.830> so<00:03:59.860> that's<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.700> plan<00:04:00.910> there<00:04:01.120> we<00:04:02.020> got

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
country so that's the plan there we got

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.199 
country so that's the plan there we got
the<00:04:02.230> young<00:04:02.440> guys<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.850> know<00:04:03.880> some<00:04:04.180> of

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
the young guys in there you know some of

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.930 
the young guys in there you know some of
those<00:04:04.390> some<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:04.959> those<00:04:05.050> guys<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:06.610> shouldn't

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
those some of those guys we shouldn't

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.090 
those some of those guys we shouldn't
give<00:04:07.090> up<00:04:07.120> bonus<00:04:07.570> points<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.350> we<00:04:08.860> think<00:04:08.980> we

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
give up bonus points on and we think we

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.470 
give up bonus points on and we think we
got<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.310> make<00:04:09.400> some<00:04:09.550> changes<00:04:09.730> there<00:04:10.060> so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
got to make some changes there so

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.960 
got to make some changes there so
between<00:04:10.750> now<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.230> they're<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.580> Big<00:04:12.730> Ten's

some

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.850 
some
really<00:04:26.629> really<00:04:26.780> good<00:04:26.900> things<00:04:27.319> but<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> other

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
really really good things but the other

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.350 
really really good things but the other
thing<00:04:28.069> is<00:04:28.250> positive<00:04:28.729> as<00:04:28.849> our<00:04:28.939> young<00:04:29.060> guys<00:04:29.210> have
