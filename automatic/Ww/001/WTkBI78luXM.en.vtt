millimeter<00:03:04.069> wrench<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:06.569> tight<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:08.060> then

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
millimeter wrench to tight and then

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.600 
millimeter wrench to tight and then
that's<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.540> only<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.200> put<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> wheel<00:03:11.160> back

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
first you need to use the seek line use

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.010 
first you need to use the seek line use
the<00:03:20.330> see<00:03:20.540> climb<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.220> press<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:22.700> all<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.840> way
