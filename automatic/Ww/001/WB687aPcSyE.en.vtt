00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
don't think was completely intentional

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.730 
don't think was completely intentional
on<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.900> gamer<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.800> developers<00:02:14.580> part<00:02:15.740> but

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
on the gamer on the developers part but

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.680

fortunately<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> public<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.700> can't<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.180> hurt

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
fortunately the public can can't be hurt

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
fortunately the public can can't be hurt
by<00:02:30.540> anything<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.860> also<00:02:32.010> conveniently<00:02:32.340> walks

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
by anything it also conveniently walks

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.070 
by anything it also conveniently walks
in<00:02:32.970> whatever<00:02:33.120> direction<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.720> set<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> down

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
in whatever direction you set it down

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.280 
in whatever direction you set it down
every<00:02:34.590> time<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> set<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.140> not

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
every time you set it down so it's not

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.810 
every time you set it down so it's not
really<00:02:37.530> too<00:02:37.709> frustrating<00:02:38.810> but<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.459> forgot

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
really too frustrating but and I forgot

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.380 
really too frustrating but and I forgot

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
there's a wonderful example of the fact

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830 
there's a wonderful example of the fact
that<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.430> need<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.670> take<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> running<00:02:48.239> start<00:02:48.600> on

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that you need to take a running start on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.320 
that you need to take a running start on
jumps<00:02:50.180> let's<00:02:51.180> try<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.390> again

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
jumps let's try it again

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
jumps let's try it again
this<00:02:54.330> time<00:02:55.790> take<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.820> puppy<00:02:57.330> oh<00:02:57.799> yes<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.130> when

this time take the puppy oh yes and when

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.470 
this time take the puppy oh yes and when
you<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> puppy<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.269> mouth

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you have the puppy in your mouth

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
you have the puppy in your mouth
obviously<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> can't<00:03:01.680> bark<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.130> attack

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
obviously you can't bark to attack

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.440 
obviously you can't bark to attack
enemies<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:04.430> would<00:03:05.430> say<00:03:05.579> something<00:03:05.850> about<00:03:06.090> how

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
enemies I would say something about how

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.840 
enemies I would say something about how
attacking<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> bark<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.040> rather<00:03:08.250> what's<00:03:08.700> he

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
attacking the bark is rather what's he

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.370 
attacking the bark is rather what's he
kept<00:03:09.060> saying<00:03:09.269> you're<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> gigantic<00:03:09.930> Saint

there<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.730> kind<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.060> fits<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.570> movie<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
there it kind of fits in the movie I

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.890 
there it kind of fits in the movie I
mean<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:14.519> believe<00:03:14.940> Beethoven<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.780> at

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
mean I don't believe Beethoven was at

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.720 
mean I don't believe Beethoven was at
all<00:03:16.049> aggressive<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.769> think<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> real<00:03:17.400> passive

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
all aggressive I think is a real passive

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.400 
all aggressive I think is a real passive
dog<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.360> much<00:03:21.450> makes<00:03:21.780> sense<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.350> I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
dog so it pretty much makes sense that I

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.949 
dog so it pretty much makes sense that I
won't<00:03:22.650> i<00:03:23.010> won't<00:03:23.700> chastise<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> developers

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.789 
won't i won't chastise the developers
for<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.850> apparently<00:03:27.420> i<00:03:27.750> can't<00:03:28.049> drop<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289 
it's sort of how did he shoot me when I

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.950 
it's sort of how did he shoot me when I
was<00:07:10.499> attacking<00:07:10.800> it<00:07:11.009> whatever<00:07:11.509> the<00:07:12.509> duck<00:07:12.689> is

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
was attacking it whatever the duck is

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.980 
was attacking it whatever the duck is
pretty<00:07:13.199> useful<00:07:14.029> for<00:07:15.029> dodging<00:07:15.419> those<00:07:15.539> bullets

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990
