00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.400
 In the article that I write a blog called inappropriate blog 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.950
 I instructed to open an account at max trader 32 in the past 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.569
 I have actually made a deal with 28 sen 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.339
 I used to get a laptop from a pc, but recently an iphone 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.339
 Trading from the market has become frequently an argument 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.310
 Several 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.349
 I would like to try sx4-proud but I especially care about it 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.759
 What's up is Click Stock's iClip Avex 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.520
 There are about 3 reasons why I heard that 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.130
 curtain 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 Eco icon button 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.040
 I will support you when moving 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 It is an extension so far, but in the case of other companies 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.760
 ivy and password 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.050
 Asked 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.340
 Easy to get up 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.480
 Some apps are getting harder 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.740
 Cyclic Avex is launched soon 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.570
 Very easy to use 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 And I am going to wear 2.22 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.980
 Through this date a bit of the Fuku Council plate and this under it 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.180
 There is a muse 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.850
 Worldwide operation 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 Various heights 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.230
 I was drunk 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.760
 The point where you can see this example at the same time as the country is far and personal 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.010
 To 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.640
 Easy to use 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.320
 And the third point eco-re I am the most ... What 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 Cat iphone 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.910
 If you get out of the other side 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.700
 Switch to chart screen 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.960
 My brother had a lot of wear on the tree alone 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370
 I said that I answered because I was easily concerned 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.080
 And also to the time axis 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.620
 I want to like 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 Hundreds and sevens 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.499
 Talked 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:12.879
 I told that I was singing 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.579
 Hiraishi Madoka 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.739
 And now a little different 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.339
 It's been a while 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.289
 Of course one step is below 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.339
 It can be said that 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 And again, a type of Kyoto based on collagen 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.979
 Update and 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.999
 It will be the screen of the news 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.809
 I really like it 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.859
 Even if you don't launch apc, you can eat various information 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:37.819
 Get it 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 Because you can trade quickly 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.979
 Cut into squares
