00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hey guys it's me again so I've got some

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.990 
hey guys it's me again so I've got some
more<00:00:05.609> place<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.270> put<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:07.790> and<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.880> should

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
more place and put in and this should

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:39.910 
more place and put in and this should
just<00:00:09.210> help<00:00:09.389> with<00:00:09.660> making<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.139> easier<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> dig

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:50.810 

and<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.340> should<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:49.460> now<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> trying<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and that should do it now I trying to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:10.149 
and that should do it now I trying to
mix<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.420> in

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.609 

so<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.940> just<00:01:12.060> child's<00:01:12.479> play<00:01:12.510> send<00:01:12.990> these

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so this is just child's play send these

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.120 
so this is just child's play send these
for<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.009> aiming

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
for this so this is what you're aiming

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.420 
for this so this is what you're aiming
for<00:01:20.550> when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.800> when<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:22.860> add<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.190> soy<00:01:23.369> into

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
for when you when you add the soy into

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
for when you when you add the soy into
the<00:01:23.729> tank<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.869> substrate<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> have

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the tank you want me substrate to have

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.380 
the tank you want me substrate to have
this<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.890> consistency<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> dig<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
this or consistency so when you dig it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:39.469 
this or consistency so when you dig it
it<00:01:30.390> holds<00:01:30.659> its<00:01:30.840> form<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:32.190> see<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:38.479> there's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it holds its form to see that so there's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.499 
it holds its form to see that so there's
about<00:01:39.830> 11<00:01:40.830> inches<00:01:41.220> were<00:01:41.610> substrate<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
about 11 inches were substrate in that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.190 
about 11 inches were substrate in that
moment<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.979> aims<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.899> nice<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.080> like

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
moment and the aims to go nice not like

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.740 
moment and the aims to go nice not like
13<00:01:46.590> 14<00:01:46.740> inches<00:01:47.160> width<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.300> more<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.509> can

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
13 14 inches width but the more you can

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
13 14 inches width but the more you can
give<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> bass<00:01:52.350> say<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.429> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.060> them

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
give the bass say if you can give them

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
give the bass say if you can give them
to<00:01:54.479> photo<00:01:54.990> substrate<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:56.160> hesitate<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.610> do

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
to photo substrate don't hesitate to do

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:15.140 
to photo substrate don't hesitate to do
it<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> idea<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.600> make<00:02:06.630> an<00:02:06.899> entrance<00:02:14.150> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
it the idea is to make an entrance so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.460 
it the idea is to make an entrance so
much<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.569> Santa<00:02:16.110> mix<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.260> raise<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
much of the Santa mix in but raise the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.110 
much of the Santa mix in but raise the
level<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> substrate<00:02:20.310> quite<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> bit<00:02:20.760> so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
level of the substrate quite a bit so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:03:05.320 
level of the substrate quite a bit so
that's<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.540> good<00:02:21.690> thing

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.700 

okay<00:03:06.330> see<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.780> that's<00:03:07.050> holding<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.440> form

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
okay see that that's holding this form

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.300 
okay see that that's holding this form
really<00:03:07.980> nicely<00:03:12.500> okay<00:03:13.500> see<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.860> go<00:03:14.010> finish

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
really nicely okay see we go finish

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.330 
really nicely okay see we go finish
result<00:03:18.410> now<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> don't<00:03:19.890> think<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
result now I don't think it's going to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.060 
result now I don't think it's going to
last<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:21.060> wants<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.050> get<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.350> soil<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.860> there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
last but wants to get more soil in there

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.690 
last but wants to get more soil in there
I<00:03:23.720> should<00:03:24.720> bulk<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> up<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.550> should

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I should bulk it up a bit and it should

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
I should bulk it up a bit and it should
be<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.820> hold<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.120> bar<00:03:28.220> all<00:03:29.220> right
