00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
longest you can have this for so the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
longest you can have this for so the
only<00:01:07.830> thing<00:01:08.010> bad<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
only thing bad about this is you can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
only thing bad about this is you can
only<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.650> cargo<00:01:10.890> plane<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
only get this cargo plane in this

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.810 
only get this cargo plane in this
mission<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> good<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
mission so it's not that good but is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
mission so it's not that good but is
good<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:15.900> mess<00:01:16.259> around<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
good because you can mess around with a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
good because you can mess around with a
cargo<00:01:17.009> plane<00:01:17.040> inside<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.330> def<00:01:18.689> match<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cargo plane inside of this def match so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
cargo plane inside of this def match so
basically<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
basically you just want to start this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.580 
basically you just want to start this
thing<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> once<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.110> started<00:01:22.229> up

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
thing up and once you have started up

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.249 
thing up and once you have started up
you're<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> load<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
you're going to load up right by the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
you're going to load up right by the
