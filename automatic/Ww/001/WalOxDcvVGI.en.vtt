swing myself maybe I can catch the
strawberry<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> odds<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.540> even

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
strawberry but then the odds are even

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
strawberry but then the odds are even
higher<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.590> may<00:01:25.770> fall<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.970> it
