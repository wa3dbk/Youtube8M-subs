 chicago matter 8 this case is not 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.220
 original

 Here is made specifically for Nokia Ria News 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.020
 from plastic and on top 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.830
 they have this small so hard 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.270
 skin goes 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.310
 all the same applied 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.470
 will give incomprehensible chip this company 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.090
 here you can touch 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.370
 skin to touch 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.780

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 real eighth 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910
 let's get a look 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.150
 what is there 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.640
 inside 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 matter not in the course neatly opened 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 5 model 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 and the eighth 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 from the inside very pleased with the cool plastic 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 very nice soft touch 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.710
 caps 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.050
 also performed 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.540
 cool enough to touch 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.630
 why is this all clear 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.350
 very nice 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.560
 very nice case 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 but I didnâ€™t even understand what it was 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 chip this company 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 here is the emblem 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.590
 here is the time 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.110
 unclear 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.300
 let's believe 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.320
 the old 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 came in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.789
 apparatus boys 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.739
 when a group with a folk surface 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.999
 screen 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.789
 will not remain on the surface 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.659
 behind the decorator 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.289
 she practically 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.859
 on the same level 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.379
 what is worth quite a bit 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.469
 just a little bit 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.839
 court satisfied 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.499
 on the side all technically lifting 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.499
 is available 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.039
 even here a small minus the fact that in Tyumen 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.059
 I don't know about big ones yet 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.689
 quite a bit more 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 carcass yes the flow will go like this 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.819
 certificates 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.649
 here's a mole side movement that's done 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:55.879
 better than 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.019
 ul original cover mock 8 which 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.539
 transparent 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.399
 that's just covering them and there is an order here 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.399
 such a deainea 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.409
 is there some more 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.829
 that color 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.329
 wand 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.679
 CSKA fear this is not all 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.359
 there are many different 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.359
 you will want 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.900
 firstly because that business dates 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.279
 unusually 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.419
 note and dark 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.889
 spent here 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.889
 so in spring 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.209
 there are lovers 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.059
 dark green shadows 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:43.189
 there is such 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.430
 there are still red ones 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.329
 prosperous 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 red hills black strip idle 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.649
 so here 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.209
