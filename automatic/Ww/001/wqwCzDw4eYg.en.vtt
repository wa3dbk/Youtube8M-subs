 October 31st 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.819
 why choose an electric propulsion 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.630
 choosing electric propulsion means navigating with less impact 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.859
 environmental 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.449
 it means navigating in silence and now it also means navigating in a simple way e 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.669
 without any difficulty 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.989
 grazei torki doo outboards supplied with a permanent mnt induction engine i 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.159
 unique in the world 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.539
 it is possible to have given the great power of the engine the low consumption one 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.200
 integrated battery and motor is real motor 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.539
 it is ready to use in 11 kilograms without hp 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.260
 without any difficulty, therefore ideal for tenders or as an auxiliary engine 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.700
 the tokido engines can be folded back in a lower space 50 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.860

 more 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.140
 they also have a power that sets them apart because they have a ranch 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.309
 of powers that goes 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.199
 from a motor comparable to a horse and a half-blast up engine comparable to 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.930
 10 horses per burst 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.320
 moreover the tokito engines have a lithium manganese battery and can 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.450
 be fully charged in about 10 hours 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 or even partially and in the first hours of charge 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.210
 already gets a 40% of refill and with 3000 refills it was a lifetime guarantee 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.800
 about 5 years without any kind of performance loss and the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 possibility of seeing always check the state of charge thanks to the test of 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.380
 indicated above the battery 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.939

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.539
 of 3 kilograms inserted inside the engine the battery is disassembled with a 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.100
 only movement yes ingot fave removed the pin just on the top bar and the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.220
 battery ready to be disconnected 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.860
 It has a charge indicator that indicates the charge from you in Rome 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.199
 it is recharged by inserting the plug in the appropriate seat 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.390
 in 10 hours it is fully charged 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.480
 it is possible to have partial recharges indicating the battery without memory effects 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 another movement can be reinserted 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.199
