00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.990
 we are here at cibus 5 May 2014 with 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.910
 monica bianchessi and put a palma ti 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.189
 welcome backers 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.210
 welcome to everyone what we prepare to 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.650
 today 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.640
 today it's tough because we prepare two 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.199
 I have to say quite complex dishes 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.259
 however simple they can easily be 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.780
 repeating a fundamental thing at home is true 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.810
 but exact cat we start one for each 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.970
 a fast pasta dough also that 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.440
 with a fresh pasta and friggitelli 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.200
 that we're going to fry drowned in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.840
 drowned notice rate the term 30 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.130
 end of families and here it is and then nothing 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.100
 we will add all the other two losers 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.900
 but right now let's start with 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.040
 lighting up the plate ad 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.050
 induction which is not always a matter of course 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.390
 however monica explain a moment I see 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.580
 of chopped shallot of anchovies e 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.150
 of anchovies in oil and then gods 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.250
 fresh friggitelli of like 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.020
 i would prepare main are they are 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.450
 these are not been and chillies 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.670
 lombardi also called so that we go 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.700
 to cut to arouse the exact star 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.130
 oil in this case non-stick pan 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.640
 but remember when cooking pasta 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.040
 it is always better to use a pan 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.980
 in steel because it is rougher and therefore 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.610
 the creaming will be better just 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.830
 then pinch some salt immediately 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.869
 because hydro-scopic removes all the water 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.260
 with vegetables and cedaw in cooking 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.320
 so I would add some more 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.600
 oil because but because all this is a 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.310
 yes it is true a sauce but the brother 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 however, the Amap Lombard Chilli 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 currently the oil so if you 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.190
 different types of oil indeed 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.810
 now they need more than 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.280
 toast with with something in the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.619
 mind in which we can wither 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.510
 add therese we go to put the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.190
 salt in water and then we can 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.690
 add our fresh made pasta 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.120
 by hand this was water and flour 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.730
 imagine it remains a priest carriage 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.720
 just the sigma nothing nobody forbids us 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.760
 of course you can use 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.850
 use an egg pasta if you do 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.769
 like it or how I always like it 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.410
 remember the dried pasta what 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.470
 everyone has julie in the cupboard 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.470
 in fact in the area the pantry cannot 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.470
 very well 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 feel how we cook them on 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.670
 principle must then pass which one goes 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.340
 at about 5 minutes river but I quote come 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.250
 as of course the cooking of the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.709
 our pasta more or less once 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.140
 passiti then we can add all the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.380
 we have chosen the team of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.140
 pomÃ¬ and here it is 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.140
 let's make a slight tina rose like that 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.390
 and in any case, as you can see, I am already well drowned 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.940
 here I like this past because it is 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.330
 a little rustic ie you can still see the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.490
 nor a piece of the tomato that smells 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.110
 of exceptional fresh tomato 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.240
 fantastic we don't cook it much 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 the dispensable time because they do 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.010
 scaldi pomodoro but should not cook not 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.230
 must become gravy we have not put 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.950
 a lot of staying in the water controls 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.350
 let it be enough here, however, let us remember 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.000
 that there is also the junta and the escape 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.330
 eventually it could even ruin the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.050
 flat if we don't show we are careful 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.170
 al salesi 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.430
 ok okay something i like about gods 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.720
 values is that they remain a little too much 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 right yards 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.630
 we see 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.190
 we drained the pasta here 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.220
 I would put a nice drop of oil 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:05.210
 yes but how beautiful it is but when it is good 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.070
 but I only call good from pasta 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.340
 always remember steel pan 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.050
 possibly because it is rougher 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.209
 we light the anchovies with friction 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.910
 more chopped herbs then 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.560
 fresh thyme parsley which I love and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.919
 basil we also put some 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.090
 basil in honor your ok we test 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.330
 please taste go and then what to say 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.390
 if not ready, the dish is on the table 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.390
 served
