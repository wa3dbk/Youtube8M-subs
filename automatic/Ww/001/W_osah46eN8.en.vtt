I'd<00:02:05.110> say<00:02:05.290> two<00:02:05.350> hours<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.010> figure<00:02:06.280> everything

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
I'd say two hours to figure everything

I'd say two hours to figure everything
out<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.170> find<00:02:08.170> out<00:02:08.320> where<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.500> want<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:08.890> the

out and find out where I want to put the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.160 
out and find out where I want to put the
wires<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.520> all<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:11.110> what<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> ended<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.460> doing

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
wires and all but what I ended up doing

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.840 
wires and all but what I ended up doing
was<00:02:14.250> got<00:02:15.250> down<00:02:15.460> here<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.120> fuse<00:02:16.390> box<00:02:17.670> down<00:02:18.670> on

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
was got down here as a fuse box down on

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.280 
was got down here as a fuse box down on
that<00:02:18.970> fuse<00:02:19.210> box<00:02:19.240> there<00:02:19.980> push<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> wire<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
that fuse box there push the wire in to

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.490 
that fuse box there push the wire in to
one<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> fuses<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:26.080> about<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.470> only

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
one of the fuses and it's about the only

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.140 
one of the fuses and it's about the only
way<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.800> wanted<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.820> way<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.000> can

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
way I wanted to do it that way I can

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.930 
way I wanted to do it that way I can
easily<00:02:28.240> pull<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.490> routed<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
easily pull it out and then I routed the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.600 
easily pull it out and then I routed the
wire<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:32.640> through<00:02:33.640> here<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.010> goes<00:02:36.220> all

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
wire up through here kind of goes all

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.920 
wire up through here kind of goes all
the<00:02:36.640> way<00:02:36.760> up<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.590> there<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:40.330> underneath

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the way up just in there up underneath

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.580 
the way up just in there up underneath
this<00:02:41.380> weather<00:02:41.710> seal<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:43.960> see<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.350> I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
this weather seal if you can see it I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.980 
this weather seal if you can see it I
was<00:02:45.520> able<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.240> thing<00:02:46.450> moves<00:02:46.720> a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
was able to this this thing moves a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.570 
was able to this this thing moves a
little<00:02:47.110> bit<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:47.890> slide<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.400> wire

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
little bit you can just slide the wire

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.400 
little bit you can just slide the wire
up<00:02:48.820> underneath<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.450> whole<00:02:49.690> deal<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:49.960> here

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
up underneath this whole deal right here

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.080 
up underneath this whole deal right here
and<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.100> goes<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.520> underneath<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.910> pop<00:02:54.910> this

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
and it goes up underneath this pop this

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.910 
and it goes up underneath this pop this
little<00:02:55.360> plastic<00:02:55.540> piece<00:02:55.810> off<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:59.590> helps

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
little plastic piece off here that helps

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.300 
little plastic piece off here that helps
that<00:03:00.070> wire<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.700> stay<00:03:00.940> up<00:03:01.150> on<00:03:01.380> up<00:03:02.380> there<00:03:02.800> it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
that wire just stay up on up there it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.930 
that wire just stay up on up there it
doesn't<00:03:03.520> fall<00:03:04.000> down<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.480> bad<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:06.340> had<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.640> route

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
doesn't fall down as bad it had to route

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.840 
doesn't fall down as bad it had to route
it<00:03:07.120> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> funny<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:08.770> keep<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.130> wire<00:03:09.580> from

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
it kind of funny to keep a wire from

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.410 
it kind of funny to keep a wire from
blocking<00:03:10.350> all<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.680> sensors<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:13.000> least<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
blocking all the sensors at least the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.890 
blocking all the sensors at least the
the<00:03:13.780> laser<00:03:14.320> deal<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.100> here<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.640> don't<00:03:16.390> even

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
the laser deal up in here I don't even

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.930 
the laser deal up in here I don't even
know<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.320> that'll<00:03:17.650> catch<00:03:18.190> anything<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
know if that'll catch anything out the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.670 
know if that'll catch anything out the
back<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.930> know<00:03:19.989> hang<00:03:20.350> it'll<00:03:20.530> block

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
back but you know hang it'll block

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.210 
back but you know hang it'll block
anything<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:22.510> looks<00:03:22.690> okay<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.440> definitely

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
anything it looks okay I definitely

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.270 
anything it looks okay I definitely
can't<00:03:24.610> see<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.910> from<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.209> outside<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.680> that's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
can't see it from the outside and that's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.520 
can't see it from the outside and that's
the<00:03:27.489> goal<00:03:27.700> here<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.019> really<00:03:29.290> got<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.440> be

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
the goal here and you really got to be

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.550 
the goal here and you really got to be
looking<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:31.440> one<00:03:32.440> thing<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.680> got<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:32.980> do<00:03:33.220> is

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
looking but one thing you got to do is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.350 
looking but one thing you got to do is
find<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.739> mounting<00:03:36.160> point<00:03:36.489> for<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.880> first

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
find the mounting point for it first

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.240 
find the mounting point for it first
all<00:03:37.989> right<00:03:38.110> here<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:39.120> got<00:03:41.910> pretty<00:03:42.910> good<00:03:44.250> reach

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
all right here I got pretty good reach

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.850 
all right here I got pretty good reach
once<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.820> car<00:03:46.090> does<00:03:46.690> its<00:03:46.900> deal

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
once the car does its deal

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.990 
once the car does its deal
gets<00:03:49.860> conceited<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:52.020> can<00:03:52.349> sit<00:03:52.590> here

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
gets conceited up but I can sit here

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.270 
gets conceited up but I can sit here
pretty<00:03:54.000> much<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.330> is<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.540> view<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:56.190> I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
pretty much this is the view I get and I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.150 
pretty much this is the view I get and I
can<00:03:56.459> still<00:03:56.730> mute<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.480> quite<00:03:57.900> easily<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:59.130> can

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
can still mute it quite easily and I can

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.270 
can still mute it quite easily and I can
see<00:03:59.489> it<00:03:59.610> flash<00:04:00.500> as<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.709> driving<00:04:02.040> down<00:04:02.130> the

see it flash as I'm driving down the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.479 
see it flash as I'm driving down the
road<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.930> way<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.110> catch<00:04:04.769> my<00:04:05.010> attention<00:04:05.040> a

road that way I catch my attention a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.500 
road that way I catch my attention a
little<00:04:05.730> bit<00:04:05.819> better<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:07.670> slow<00:04:08.670> down<00:04:08.910> or<00:04:09.150> at

little bit better and slow down or at

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.740 
little bit better and slow down or at
least<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.110> put<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.099> in<00:04:11.340> first<00:04:11.640> at<00:04:12.599> least

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750

it it has to be fairly close to wherever
your<00:04:16.200> powers<00:04:16.560> exa<00:04:17.090> power<00:04:18.090> wires<00:04:18.389> only<00:04:18.870> three

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
your powers exa power wires only three

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.280 
your powers exa power wires only three
or<00:04:19.769> four<00:04:20.070> foot<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> remote<00:04:21.600> wire<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
or four foot but the remote wire that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.080 
or four foot but the remote wire that
goes<00:04:22.350> all<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> way<00:04:22.830> up<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.250> around<00:04:23.370> it's

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
goes all the way up and around it's

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.379 
goes all the way up and around it's
quite<00:04:24.660> long<00:04:25.580> I'd<00:04:26.580> say<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> were<00:04:27.180> going<00:04:27.210> to

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
quite long I'd say if you were going to

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.650 
quite long I'd say if you were going to
do<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.020> truck<00:04:28.760> you'd<00:04:29.760> have<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.000> enough

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
do it in a truck you'd have just enough

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.900 
do it in a truck you'd have just enough
room<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.860> had<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.130> mounted<00:04:32.250> over<00:04:32.580> on<00:04:32.790> the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
room if you had it mounted over on the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.659 
room if you had it mounted over on the
far<00:04:33.090> side<00:04:33.419> like<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.840> do<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.229> don't<00:04:35.130> like<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.490> being

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
far side like I do I don't like it being

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:44.980 
far side like I do I don't like it being
in<00:04:35.850> my<00:04:36.000> vision<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:39.150> yeah<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:40.130> run<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.280> wires

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.590 

this<00:04:45.990> little<00:04:46.470> deal<00:04:46.620> here<00:04:47.210> goes<00:04:48.210> underneath

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
this little deal here goes underneath

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.040 
this little deal here goes underneath
that<00:04:48.930> spreads<00:04:49.380> apart<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.100> little<00:04:50.400> bit<00:04:51.050> I'm

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
holes for this I guess uh I guess velcro

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.029 
holes for this I guess uh I guess velcro
is<00:04:59.970> bad<00:05:00.180> enough<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:01.229> don't<00:05:01.440> look<00:05:01.650> too<00:05:01.830> bad
