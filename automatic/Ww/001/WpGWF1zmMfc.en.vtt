00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of them I'm pretty sure yep I think he

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
of them I'm pretty sure yep I think he
has<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> Nintendo<00:01:44.579> code<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.180> i'm<00:01:45.329> not

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
has a Nintendo code in there if i'm not

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.760

mistaken<00:01:46.159> they're<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.490> harder<00:01:47.880> open

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
mistaken they're a little harder open

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
mistaken they're a little harder open
there<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.119> all<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.509> manuals<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there you go all the manuals and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.039 
there you go all the manuals and
everything<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:53.450> what<00:01:54.450> else<00:01:54.570> did<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> get

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
everything in there what else did I get
