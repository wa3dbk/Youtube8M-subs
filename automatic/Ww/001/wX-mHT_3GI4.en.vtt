00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.710
 hello youtube friends today you were going to 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:11.179
 teach how to do calculations with a 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.990
 background calculator are 82 3 and it makes the 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.870
 calculation of the complex number 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 good to do that I have to do 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.810
 some previous step 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.390
 first thing I have to do is that it comes 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.020
 in the mode 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.120
 and has lent 2 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.050
 and then to borrow 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.710
 and more 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 then since being up 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.370
 to a saturation point 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 once I got here it will give you all the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.289
 setting and lifting them and then 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.700
 then to give the date to give top 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.440
 of replay 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.640
 and it's still 1 and 3 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 about three as 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 to loans 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.909
 once it is already program for the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.700
 equal track entry equal again 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.670
 and 0 and 1 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.480
 and tight equal 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.910
 and be like that 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.980
 already in condition to perform the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.850
 equations could lend here as 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.910
 said some complex and still betting 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.310
 appears for equation of 235 thousand layers 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.540
 of matrix and for voters in our 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 case first let's choose it 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.190
 well these two accounts have two and for 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 that make any complex hand because 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:06.310
 we want another base 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.310
 5 more lg for 2 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.660
 for minds and 10 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.350
 the result a 15 and to see it the part 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.860
 imaginary when it is chip equally of being 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.140
 an imaginary part 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 we can do another calculation for example 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.430
 5 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.430
 3 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.640
 two 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.140
 and to pay the same in the real part 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.260
 but imaginary apart as from here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.569
 and there I go to any calculation is even 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.950
 a factorial calculation of a language by 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:54.580
 example if you have 5 to sit 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 of person using mate and circuit 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.220
 because he's going to do 5 until s 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.910
 5 and 5 and had in his hand complex for 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.370
 a more advanced case that had another video 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.730
 to show and are now words 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.900
 more equations reappear 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.269
 you have to press, I do not feel like it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.720
 economic in our case we are going to do 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.940
 phenomenon of training incognita plague 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.190
 3rd and next here we have a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 equation that she 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.100
 there are samples to review with the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 calculator 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.260
 the heart theme though here 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.620
 and I do the scholarship lend I have we are going 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.220
 to start equality one already has three 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.000
 you do not have any and for the first 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:52.110
 letter as 17 to prestes 7 equal and for 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.599
 the 2020 and play 30 and play minus 20 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.160
 same and chad is changed directly only 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:07.580
 to illustrate the food 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:09.820
 which is 15 equal 348 equal and 0 equal 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.820
 yes 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.470
 Y 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.470
 same 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.840
 equal 4 equal and already directly I get 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.840
 the result where x 4 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.240
 already lend and return only more to the law 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.440
 5 and squeezed through zeta level 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.230
 22 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.400
 and there as you in my performance is 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:49.509
 human and you can 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.509
 if we check we have 7 by 94 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.490
 to 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.700
 for two 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.270
 5 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.270
 plus 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.520
 for the neighborhood 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.460
 at 5 and so on that operation that has 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:12.160
 to give minus 20 to check what 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:14.130
 there are like 27 and coming out of that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.540
 4 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.500
 91 1 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.500
 twenty 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.099
 more front 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.099
 - 3.05 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.130
 in everything 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.669
 and he's giving me 20 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.310
 well this what you liked the video 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.620
 I will continue uploading video and put 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.670
 I like and subscribe 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.040
 on my channel and so 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.370
 lobby event of the cheese up to what 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.370
 they like
