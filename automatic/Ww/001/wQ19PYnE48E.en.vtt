00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.520
 to me 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.810
 Talk to everyone here with erick. 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.710
 critics and today I'm going to try something 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.910
 different 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.619
 You know the series of curiosities. 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.480
 that criticized and undoed him 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.140
 practically since the beginning of the life of the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.260
 site 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.270
 Well then, meet the pilot of the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.160
 video in our series for us and chic 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.750
 decided to bring the best curiosities 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.200
 from the world of games to the screen of your 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.440
 device is there with you are using 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 Let's go to what matters to fans of games. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.760
 when gta 4 was released 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 rockstar made a bunch of materials 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.060
 to promote the game, right? 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.160
 after all they invested a 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.360
 trolls in the game wanted to 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.940
 sell one of these posters that was created 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.100
 for the game is the lola that we are 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.440
 seeing that there is a lot of detail 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.490
 interesting, I really do not know if you 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.040
 they noticed but the blonde has six fingers 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.080
 she is eating pedro lito and if you 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 tell right has one two three four 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.500
 five fingers in her hand and the big toe together 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.439
 in fact the truth is part of her hand but 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.939
 You got to understand, you do not have a thumb. 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.390
 five fingers 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.979
 Is it related to cicarelli? 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.329
 I do not know but she still has more 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.060
 fingers that most of the people I 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.210
 I know and much more than our 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.069
 wanted this president lula 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.829
 Can anybody explain why the hell 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.600
 drive 2 is a most beautiful game in 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.640
 dreamcast of what they need 2 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.530
 nobody explained during the launch of the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.329
 game the reason for the graphic deficiencies 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.159
 of the game on the island of sony but 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.030
 recently the explanation of this 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.920
 second tomonobu itagaki face with the name 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.609
 fucking complicated and creator of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.439
 series 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.969
 the study led by him was 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.159
 working on game conversion 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.200
 playstation 2 that was initially released by 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.700
 a test and they still had two more 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.639
 months and a half to finish this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.450
 but the technical manager decided to 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:12.100
 two months no longer exist and this is 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.230
 meat or and pay that of a game 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.450
 borrowed saying he was going to play at home 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.430
 and actually took the game to be 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.160
 thought and sold the way that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.620
 I was like you were here, I did not 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.319
 who was to follow he lent game 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.580
 after all and a half to believe 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.870
 in people, right? 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.750
 the result of this was once 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.640
 so inferior and unfinished, and the poor 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.530
 pay here until you went into depression for 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 and almost gave up 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.670
 work with the creation of new 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.230
 everybody already played my finger 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.090
 one time or another in life, right? 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.549
 and that your finger actually expresses a 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.890
 weapon as legando and the huc a wick of the 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.780
 i workshop that by the way is one of the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 best animals of all time to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.760
 so inter space 2 this is possible but 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 so it is necessary to end the game 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.049
 in hardcore mode, no kidding 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.180
 none is too hard 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.000
 after completing this difficult task you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.010
 Earn the finger gun that makes the game seem 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 one more child's play a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.730
 mental retardation of the more light head 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 since every time he shoots him 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.200
 What is the good? 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.810
 depending on the type of shot that is 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.730
 using and to complete madness still the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 gun is strong for fuck what it means 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.569
 I continue well given everything kills 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.459
 virtually any game necromorphs and 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.019
 leave no stone unturned on the way 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.970
 of isaac the piradÃ£o the gripper that means 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.510
 which is one of the characters references of 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.220
 minecraft was created by chance 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.620
 when making a model on the pig one of the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.930
 game designers put proportions of 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.910
 height and width the opposite doing with 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.329
 that the public had the original body 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.919
 of the keeper and probably 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.599
 stayed there in the left image that 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.190
 still appearing on the spectacle stage 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.180
 since I started to tell this 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.019
 curiosity 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.079
 it seems that the development team 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.419
 liked that bizarre way and found 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.579
 she's scary for some reason doing 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.919
 so the keeper is born that in English 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.049
 it means kind of scary 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.970
 something like that but everyone knows that 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.220
 This is a lie since the clip has 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.780
 shape of my popcorn 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.440
 to complete let's talk about something 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.079
 a little heavier and a bit bizarre 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.479
 they actually knew that star heroes 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.699
 fox had their legs amputated so they 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.010
 blood did not hit their heads 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.530
 due to the great gravitational force that 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.680
 the gigantic ships exert on the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.120
 their bodies as they go so it 's 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.960
 remember the next time you go 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.300
 to play a squad game because the fox 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.550
 It's nice people like you guys. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.620
 pay attention to the video that is 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.500
 Rolling, you can see that fox really 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.860
 metal and whether it left the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.970
 legs somewhere probably not 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.560
 walking to save mankind there is no 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.360
 most recent games in the series 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.000
 Nintendo even traded these legs for 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.449
 mental boots but anyway this 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.130
 story is hauntingly bizarre and 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.410
 whatever kind of sad also in income in 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.530
 I really feel sorry for the 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.500
 poor fox not having legs and 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.070
 freedom in cm that the pinocchio version of 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.810
 metal with our pilot of the 5 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.050
 curiosity about games is here 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.370
 I think the size of a more or 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.280
 less than i expected 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.510
 I think I was not that boring. 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.620
 while counting on entrepreneurs 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.919
 French, right? 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.600
 If you've reached the end of this video 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.440
 so sign up you have leave 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.360
 comments 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.419
 Leave your little sister and please, it 's very 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.639
 important and I really hope 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.940
 constructive criticism of you to 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.440
 know what to improve on an upcoming issue 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.120
 know if it's worth continuing 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.099
 doing is legally 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.970
 so until the next from all 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.970
 world and czech
