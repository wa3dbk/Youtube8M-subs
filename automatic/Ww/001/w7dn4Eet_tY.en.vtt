00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
them out and when I do nails

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.300 
them out and when I do nails
I<00:02:27.930> will<00:02:29.870> size<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> almost<00:02:32.040> fits

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I will size it so that it almost fits

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.430 
I will size it so that it almost fits
the<00:02:32.610> note<00:02:32.790> perfectly<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> doesn't

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the note perfectly and if it doesn't

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.000 
the note perfectly and if it doesn't
have<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.250> figure<00:02:35.489> out<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> way<00:02:35.730> how<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.030> fix<00:02:36.360> it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
have to figure out a way how to fix it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.380 
have to figure out a way how to fix it
but<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> don't<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.459> use<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.180> much

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
but I don't really use these as much

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.070 
but I don't really use these as much
anymore

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
anymore

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.560 
anymore
because<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.739> don't<00:02:40.890> do<00:02:41.580> nail<00:02:41.820> extensions<00:02:42.390> as

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
because I don't do nail extensions as

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.010 
because I don't do nail extensions as
much<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:44.190> don't<00:02:44.880> work<00:02:45.270> at<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.630> old<00:02:45.810> shop

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
much because I don't work at my old shop

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.430 
much because I don't work at my old shop
so<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.880> shop<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.239> work<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:48.840> don't<00:02:49.050> do<00:02:49.200> nail

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
so the shop I work out we don't do nail

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.530 
so the shop I work out we don't do nail
extensions

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
extensions

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.420 
extensions
so<00:02:51.800> these<00:02:52.800> are<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.370> few<00:02:53.400> more<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.000> made

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.920 

these<00:02:59.030> ones<00:02:59.269> are<00:02:59.989> small<00:03:00.469> I<00:03:00.590> cut<00:03:00.829> them<00:03:00.980> out<00:03:01.099> and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
these ones are small I cut them out and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.110 
these ones are small I cut them out and
they're<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.049> size<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:04.219> copied<00:03:04.969> it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
they're this size because I copied it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.569 
they're this size because I copied it
from<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.390> internet<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.829> made<00:03:07.430> them

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
from the internet and I made them

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.899 
from the internet and I made them
smaller<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.359> that<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.540> can<00:03:09.340> put<00:03:10.340> them<00:03:10.489> next<00:03:10.730> to

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
smaller so that I can put them next to

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.839 
smaller so that I can put them next to
each<00:03:11.030> other<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:12.950> fit<00:03:13.159> better<00:03:13.519> to

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
each other so that they fit better to

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.470 
each other so that they fit better to
the<00:03:13.969> nails<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.739> feel<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:17.060> less

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
the nails and it's I feel like it's less

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.709 
the nails and it's I feel like it's less
ways<00:03:17.810> if<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.139> do<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.379> that<00:03:18.500> way<00:03:18.680> actually

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:19.719 
ways if you do it that way actually

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.230 
ways if you do it that way actually
that's<00:03:20.719> just<00:03:21.019> some

don't<00:04:56.700> even<00:04:56.880> use<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.420> because<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.260> doesn't

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
don't even use it because it doesn't

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.410 
don't even use it because it doesn't
really<00:04:58.620> smudge<00:04:59.070> like<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.520> because<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.240> put

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
really smudge like that because you put

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.100 
really smudge like that because you put
on<00:05:00.510> top<00:05:00.780> coat<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:01.890> fine

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
on top coat and it's fine

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.809 
on top coat and it's fine
and<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.680> ink<00:05:03.889> doesn't<00:05:04.220> come<00:05:04.460> off<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.789> the

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
and the ink doesn't come off in the

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.179 
and the ink doesn't come off in the
water<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:05.389> basically<00:05:06.349> this<00:05:06.620> is<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.129> just

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
water so basically this is it you just

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.719 
water so basically this is it you just
need<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.990> print<00:05:09.259> well<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.340> just<00:05:10.460> need<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
need to print well you just need the

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.379 
need to print well you just need the
paper

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
paper

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.540 
paper
and<00:05:12.289> then<00:05:12.439> you<00:05:12.530> need<00:05:12.650> your<00:05:12.710> design<00:05:13.189> and<00:05:13.490> you

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
and then you need your design and you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.159 
and then you need your design and you
print<00:05:13.849> it<00:05:13.939> on<00:05:14.060> your<00:05:14.090> paper<00:05:14.389> you<00:05:14.539> just<00:05:14.870> cut<00:05:15.050> it

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
print it on your paper you just cut it

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.890 
print it on your paper you just cut it
out<00:05:15.319> you<00:05:16.129> put<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.580> water<00:05:16.819> and<00:05:16.939> you<00:05:17.539> stick<00:05:17.780> it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
out you put it in water and you stick it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.110 
out you put it in water and you stick it
to<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.139> nail<00:05:18.349> with<00:05:18.680> topcoat<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.759> you<00:05:19.969> can

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
to the nail with topcoat and you can

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.779 
to the nail with topcoat and you can
also<00:05:20.330> encase<00:05:20.960> them<00:05:21.199> in<00:05:21.379> an<00:05:21.500> acrylic<00:05:22.189> if<00:05:22.580> you

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
also encase them in an acrylic if you

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.300 
also encase them in an acrylic if you
prefer<00:05:23.569> it<00:05:23.659> that<00:05:23.750> way<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:24.710> really<00:05:25.099> don't

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
prefer it that way so you really don't

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.279 
prefer it that way so you really don't
