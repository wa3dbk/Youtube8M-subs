00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.490
 Today's video we will show you the 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.670
 minecraft pocket edition and want one 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.170
 try out the multiplayer and 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.480
 yes you see here we have here 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.480
 a few bit both tablets are needed 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.160
 but we get right on the spot 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.340
 Let's hope that's about that 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.410
 goes and yes we play it once 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.859
 the ipad 3 and on the samsung galaxy 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.720
 note 10.1 as on android and ipad and 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.420
 we're testing that together now 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.270
 works and yes between the two 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:40.840
 different operating systems that is 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.320
 now the version 7.3 alpha 0.7 point 3 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.460
 and we can just start 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.240
 we step dryness on play and we 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.030
 make a you and yes creative us 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.110
 go to doubt 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.550
 and we'll leave it that way first 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.370
 could also set you off 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 that is how the world is structured 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.510
 and now that's kind of a load you see 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 it is relatively fast the ipad 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.050
 a little bit faster 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.460
 yes here we are now and here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.050
 we can see our things 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.290
 so if we click this button here 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.979
 click and up here as you with the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.140
 so to speak that is actually that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 main come running run 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.850
 to look around 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 of course, as you move here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.250
 You do not always have the best 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.259
 changes from the jump can be a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.840
 run and then by itself and you now 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.930
 keep pressed then you need to subscribe 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.590
 the circle is filling or feeling is 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.850
 that's the element you just have 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 wants to break down mined 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.840
 I have that different here with me now 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.670
 Just set that for 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.960
 As always, my body has agnes 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.369
 You can in the settings but 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.290
 actually number different places 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.730
 like that and now you want to go under the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.269
 provide options to load a server 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.269
 we make it clear 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.010
 then I go out with my world and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.580
 I hope now that it is still like that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.580
 it was before 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 that's ok, that's where he comes from 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.720
 to me, to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.069
 must appear at the same time and me 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.690
 should be in your world I believe 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.990
 then you had to save then synonymous 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.970
 I think export per 466 and her 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.010
 me already there behind them here 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.450
 you can already see the product 466 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.150
 So it worked great between 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.650
 android and ios I find very class was 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.989
 that actually hardly ever works 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000
 playing with little or more in android or 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.209
 Playing ios is a connectivity 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.360
 between android os available really great 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:29.040
 Florian made and I beat 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.420
 no that was a notification so 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.590
 As I said that's all me 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.380
 Do not believe in minecraft 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.330
 explain a lot 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.640
 Everyone knows that a bit anyway 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.690
 different but in the rough whole game 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.080
 yes, there are a few new ones here 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.670
 things with the update 7.3 I believe it 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.250
 once admitted omitted added 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.010
 short and the online multiplayer game 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.900
 but that does not work for us 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.420
 is limited for a few players 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 can then over each other over the internet 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.769
 play on the on the minecraft sarah 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.130
 and is supposed to play a few games 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.290
 animals were available for free are 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.989
 not patching with the 7.3 and besides 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.650
 it is now a never reactor construction was 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.090
 but nice 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.820
 yes that is already a few version ago 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.930
 but now you can do it too 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.930
 in there you will be such an arena 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.280
 built around such an arena 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.410
 And then you can just such 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.740
 things like how such a thing in the world 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.740
 to get 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.550
 we hope you liked the video 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.210
 and we could give you a little bit of it 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.830
 help 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.080
 So as you said you can also do more 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.580
 of course players also invite server 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.230
 of course, dreaming is in the meantime 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.120
 same wlan network also needs to be 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.710
 no ipad or tablet of his cadre 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.600
 of course, that's normal cellphone 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.430
 works now between android and 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.870
 ios so you can also use iphone and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.620
 Samsung Galaxy S3 or so 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.890
 playing together 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.670
 Of course everything works 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.080
 and you have to say otherwise 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.580
 the game as i am improving ourselves 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.100
 yes have the last video I made 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.690
 I think it was version 0.4, that's it 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.140
 pretty much i believe seven months now 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.690
 Half a year ago and you can see 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.010
 There were quite a few differences back then 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.720
 there are no animals yet 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.090
 you can not do somborn no 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.780
 clouds yes and the world was only 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.670
 limited I do not believe this anymore 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.140
 she is really much known 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.400
 I have become bigger for your work 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.260
 maybe even in one direction and 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.740
 It was all too long 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.750
 definitely fits much bigger 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.980
 when she is still limited I know 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.510
 I can still have her what she wants 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.540
 Do not have my love last game 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.490
 limited I think so here already 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.320
 said ok then but the nonsense what 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.320
 here's the borderline 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.650
 borders so years you can of course 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.030
 also play with texture pack on everyone 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.340
 I do not know how it is with you 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.720
 but on ios as you can on about 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.100
 again on top as it was at 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.820
 galaxy r i can do you here again 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.590
 to link 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.990
 So how is it on android I have 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.370
 here in any case video for you 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.990
 and yes that was it in our 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.760
 video I think if that's not much 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.930
 say more if you have questions write 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.490
 you in the comments 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.470
 and I hope we could you 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.020
 help and look it out on a 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.370
 Channel over and see you at 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.370
 until next video shot
