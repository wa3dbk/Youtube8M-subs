00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.580 
the way over there of course and yeah so
that's<00:04:39.730> how<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:39.970> put<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:41.220> yeah<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:44.380> is

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
that's how you put it on yeah this is

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.710 
that's how you put it on yeah this is
how<00:04:44.830> like<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.520> should<00:04:45.700> look<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.180> know<00:04:46.270> if<00:04:46.600> it

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
how like it should look I know if it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.220 
how like it should look I know if it
looks<00:04:47.020> all<00:04:47.169> funny<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.570> stuff<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:50.050> guess

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
looks all funny and stuff but I guess

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.260 
looks all funny and stuff but I guess
it's<00:04:50.470> totally<00:04:50.889> worth<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.250> later<00:04:51.610> on<00:04:51.700> when<00:04:52.210> you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
it's totally worth it later on when you

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.340 
it's totally worth it later on when you
get<00:04:52.419> your<00:04:52.570> braces<00:04:52.990> off<00:04:53.370> yeah<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:56.080> another
