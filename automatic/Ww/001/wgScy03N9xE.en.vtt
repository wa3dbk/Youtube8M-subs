variety<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.290> guess<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.070> really<00:02:52.340> most<00:02:52.640> things<00:02:52.970> I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
variety I guess but really most things I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.060 
variety I guess but really most things I
knit<00:02:53.360> are<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.720> these<00:02:53.900> kinds<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.350> needles<00:02:54.560> and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
knit are on these kinds of needles and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.630 
knit are on these kinds of needles and
the<00:02:55.640> tip<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.450> would<00:02:56.510> say<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.840> medium<00:02:57.590> sharp<00:02:57.860> they

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the tip I would say is medium sharp they

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.810 
the tip I would say is medium sharp they
are<00:02:58.670> good<00:02:59.540> all-purpose<00:03:00.010> needle<00:03:01.010> tips<00:03:01.250> maybe

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
are good all-purpose needle tips maybe

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940

complicated lace pattern where you have

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.130 
complicated lace pattern where you have
complicated<00:03:07.520> decreases<00:03:08.240> like<00:03:08.390> purling<00:03:08.900> 3

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
complicated decreases like purling 3

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780

through<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.410> back<00:03:09.560> loop<00:03:09.830> or<00:03:10.070> something<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
through the back loop or something you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.030 
through the back loop or something you
might<00:03:11.000> want<00:03:11.240> sharper<00:03:11.840> needles<00:03:11.990> for<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> but

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
might want sharper needles for that but

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.820 
might want sharper needles for that but
good<00:03:13.850> all-purpose<00:03:14.060> tips<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:15.560> going<00:03:15.800> to

interchangeable needle set how to attach

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.830 
interchangeable needle set how to attach
the<00:03:19.820> cords<00:03:20.240> let's<00:03:20.690> go<00:03:20.810> ahead<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.020> take<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.140> look

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
the cords let's go ahead and take a look

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.990 
the cords let's go ahead and take a look
so<00:03:23.840> here<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.080> have<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.530> tips<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.220> here<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.760> have

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
so here I have the tips and here I have

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.570 
so here I have the tips and here I have
the<00:03:26.120> cord<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.380> set<00:03:27.620> comes<00:03:27.950> with<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> couple

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the cord and the set comes with a couple

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.390 
the cord and the set comes with a couple
of<00:03:28.640> these<00:03:28.820> little<00:03:29.240> keys<00:03:29.690> like<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.860> the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
of these little keys like this and the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.240 
of these little keys like this and the
way<00:03:31.550> this<00:03:31.730> works<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:33.260> take<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.680> cord<00:03:33.980> and

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
way this works is you take the cord and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.970 
way this works is you take the cord and
the<00:03:34.700> cord<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:35.060> threaded<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> needle<00:03:36.770> goes

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
the cord is threaded so the needle goes

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
the cord is threaded so the needle goes
on<00:03:37.160> there<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:39.160> twist<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.460> in<00:03:40.700> place

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
on there and you just twist it in place

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.480 
on there and you just twist it in place
