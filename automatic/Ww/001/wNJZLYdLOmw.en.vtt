then<00:01:40.929> secondly<00:01:41.470> doesn't<00:01:42.399> have<00:01:42.610> an<00:01:42.940> indicator

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
then secondly doesn't have an indicator

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.859 
then secondly doesn't have an indicator
pulsating<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.619> his<00:01:44.740> eyes<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.450> moment

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.279 
I'll put the indicator back on again and
we<00:01:51.610> know<00:01:51.789> one<00:01:52.000> about<00:01:52.360> at<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.659> moment<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
we know one about at the moment to

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.870 
we know one about at the moment to
benefit<00:01:53.709> from<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.039> signal<00:01:54.399> part<00:01:54.610> from<00:01:54.759> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
benefit from the signal part from the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.149 
benefit from the signal part from the
motorist<00:01:55.240> behind<00:01:55.600> me<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.830> there's<00:01:57.069> not

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
motorist behind me so there's not

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.630 
motorist behind me so there's not
exactly<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:58.119> safety<00:01:58.780> factor<00:01:58.990> here<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.649> keeping

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
exactly a safety factor here of keeping

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
exactly a safety factor here of keeping
the<00:02:00.759> indicator<00:02:01.179> flashing

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.320 

right<00:02:04.950> lights<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.430> changing<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.000> mirrors

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
right lights are changing so mirrors

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.180 
right lights are changing so mirrors
replace<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> indicator<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.759> off<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.030> go

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.309 

it's<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:12.970> considerate<00:02:13.510> driving

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
it's just considerate driving

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.850 
it's just considerate driving
is<00:02:15.799> thoughtful<00:02:16.159> driving

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.920 

now<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.520> lamppost<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.210> moved<00:02:20.420> over<00:02:20.720> now<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
now the lamppost have moved over now to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.540 
now the lamppost have moved over now to
the<00:02:21.110> left-hand<00:02:21.590> side<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.070> row<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.950 

they're<00:02:25.580> opening<00:02:25.820> out<00:02:25.970> quite<00:02:26.240> nicely<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.720> if

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
they're opening out quite nicely so if

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.750 
they're opening out quite nicely so if
we<00:02:27.110> look<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.440> at<00:02:27.650> them<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> often<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
we look up at them you can often get a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.910 
we look up at them you can often get a
clue<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.630> severity<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> curb<00:02:30.680> because

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
clue the severity of the curb because

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.590 
clue the severity of the curb because
you<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.280> often<00:02:31.490> see<00:02:31.700> them<00:02:31.880> sometimes<00:02:32.330> over

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
you can often see them sometimes over

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.780 
you can often see them sometimes over
the<00:02:32.630> top<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.900> hedgerows<00:02:33.350> now<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.430> look<00:02:34.550> here

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the top of hedgerows now if we look here

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.670 
the top of hedgerows now if we look here
as<00:02:34.880> an<00:02:34.970> example<00:02:35.090> because<00:02:35.900> now<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.470> road

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
as an example because now the road

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.710 
as an example because now the road
curves<00:02:36.950> off<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> left<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.330> lamppost

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
curves off to the left and the lamppost

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
curves off to the left and the lamppost
now<00:02:39.020> have<00:02:39.140> moved<00:02:39.290> over<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.740> again<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.100> have

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
now have moved over and again we have

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
now have moved over and again we have
this<00:02:40.370> example<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.450> junction<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.020> right

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
this example of a junction on the right

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.530 
this example of a junction on the right
and<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> lamppost<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> left<00:02:44.390> all

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
and with a lamppost here on the left all

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.530 
and with a lamppost here on the left all
by<00:02:44.690> itself<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.790> if<00:02:46.910> you're<00:02:47.060> looking<00:02:47.180> for<00:02:47.510> a
