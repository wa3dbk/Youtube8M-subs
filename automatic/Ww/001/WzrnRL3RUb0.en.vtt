 aircraft carrier royal fleet argus 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 britain adopted 16 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.940
 September 1918 is the first in the world 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 classic aircraft carrier with 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 flat runway deck 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869
 created from a passenger liner he 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.119
 became an experimental testing ground and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.779
 the beginning of the development of the entire world marine 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 aviation 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.190
 Hello everyone today, I will tell about the first 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.900
 classic watermelon little aircraft carriers 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.100
 stories 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.350
 originally the ship was laid as 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.360
 passenger liner cantor co for 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.580
 Italian shipping company however 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.010
 the outbreak of World War I changed 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.750
 plans and shipbuilders and customers 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.170
 construction was suspended in 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.330
 august 1916 admiralty 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.640
 bought the unfinished building enough 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.950
 large liner to rebuild and in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.050
 hydra air transport however already in progress 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.600
 the refurbishment was decided 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 rebuild it into an aircraft carrier for decked 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.040
 aircraft with wheeled chassis design 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 former passenger liner was 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.300
 made a lot of innovative 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 times of change and such as flat 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.690
 takeoff deck 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.210
 horizontal water smoke to exhaust smoke 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.310
 in the aft part of the aircraft carrier kit 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.830
 brake cables precursor of via 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.170
 finishers argus often exposed 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.479
 changes and modifications serve 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.000
 a kind of aircraft carrier model 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.009
 life size for testing ideas and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.990
 innovations afterwards 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.450
 used in the construction of other 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.150
 aircraft carrier argus had a local 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.409
 reservation cellar ammunition defended 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.229
 oak boards 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.909
 original artillery weapons 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.040
 the aircraft carrier consisted of two guns and 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 102 caliber anti-aircraft guns 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.020
 millimeter 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.030
 two anti-aircraft guns were installed in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.479
 nose of the aircraft carrier on top 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 the deck 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
 two other anti-aircraft guns were 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.039
 installed in the stern of the ship behind 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 stern overhang flight decks in 1942 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.319
 year his doors were armed adding 13 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 twenty millimeter and 16 12 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.950
 millimeter machine gun end forty 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.129
 third year to this weapon 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.849
 added another 8 7 and 7 machine guns 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.709
 millimeters 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.900
 commissioning Argus spurred 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.819
 design thought in other countries 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
 in the US for example in the aircraft carrier was 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.069
 rebuilt naval coal miner Jupiter 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.680
 called langley but what 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.660
 assessment can be given watermelon y with a formal 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.730
 point of view the aircraft carrier project is unlikely 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.560
 can be described as particularly successful 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.510
 since the body of the passenger liner 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.459
 difficult to read in full 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280
 suitable for ship building 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.660
 despite the modernization carried out 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.579
 small displacement caused 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.500
 a small airplane capacity and 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.750
 slow speed did not allow the aircraft carrier 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.450
 act in conjunction with a linear fleet 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.910
 unsuccessfully recognize the smoke system 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.700
 from the conduct of the criticism of the sailors underwent and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.620
 lack of tuning along with that argus 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.160
 was largely experimental 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 construct 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.630
 allowed to test in practice as 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.980
 layout solutions as well as technical 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.980
 naval aviation 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.930
 years of combat glory aircraft carriers early 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.970
 August 1940 Argus cover 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.100
 which provided the connection of the ships 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.410
 successfully performed the operation on guy 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.550
 dispatch in Malta 12 aircraft for 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 fortifications p.v. 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.120
 however, similar operation is white 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.690
 attempted in november ended 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.970
 by failure 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.810
 nine of 14 aircraft as a result 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.820
 wind changes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.670
 ran out of fuel and they died together 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.950
 with the crew also in 1940 for 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.510
 gain air group in Egypt was 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.610
 implemented a combined version 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.470
 delivery of aircraft at sea one of 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.110
 Argus participated first in this operation 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.910
 September 6th fortieth year party of 30 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.930
 airplanes safely got to 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.090
 destinations 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.100
 this path allowed us to free up something 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.720
 for ship use and on others 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.480
 directions after entering the war 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.030
 The USSR was formed the first practical 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.770
 a convoy of seven transports of raw materials 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.490
 food and military equipment 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.140
 along with the escort was a watermelon in 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.420
 1941 the argus was repaired and 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.959
 modernization after which he took 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.340
 active participation in hostilities on 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.550
 Mediterranean and North African 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.370
 Territory June 12, 42 began 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.060
 operation harpoon during its execution 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.610
 Allied command planned 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.980
 to lead a convoy of six to malta 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.810
 merchant ships with 40 three thousand tons 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.020
 supplies and fuel escort for 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.730
 cover and watermelon on June 13 convoy 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.640
 was detected by enemy forces and 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.380
 aviation attacks began due to their 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.870
 slug nasty watermelon tested 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.910
 certain problem to carry 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.800
 flight operations, it was necessary to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.310
 turn against the wind and then 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.470
 again 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.960
 occupy a place in the ranks of the convoy subjected 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.330
 heavy attacks and came to Malta only 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.820
 two merchant ships also argus took 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.010
 participation in the torch operation during this 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.930
 operations he nearly died several times 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.710
 At first the German tried to attack him. 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.320
 Submarine 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.400
 however, it was discovered and 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.220
 forced to cancel 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.500
 attack November 10 forty-second year of 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.870
 4 torpedoes were launched to the aircraft carrier 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.350
 but everyone passed by that day ended 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.810
 for argus heavy damage 250 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.680
 kilogram bomb hit 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.380
 aft part 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.870
 destroying four aircraft from the air group 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.150
 and causing serious damage to the ship itself 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.340
 at the end of the forty-third year the body was 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.470
 transferred to the status of training aircraft carriers and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.430
 on it were trained crew 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.430
 escort aircraft carriers 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.160
 and so it can be said therefore ariana with 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.979
 despite the low speed and low 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.169
 aircraft capacity argus because of its 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.750
 The innovative design has had a noticeable 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.509
 influence on the development of aircraft carriers in general 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.910
 as a training vessel argus allowed 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.680
 to train a large number of pilot 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.810
 uk ship also introduced 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.330
 contribution hostilities Sun Li 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.840
 forces at sea the time of the second world war and 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.849
 in the battle for pay on it all hope you 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.680
 learn something new subscribe to 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.990

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.210
 write in the comments about which ship you are 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.210
 would like to hear and see you soon
