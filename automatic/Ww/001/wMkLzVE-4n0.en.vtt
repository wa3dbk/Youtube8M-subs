you were to change anything for the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.540 
you were to change anything for the
committee<00:03:34.680> going<00:03:34.950> forward<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.310> know<00:03:35.400> you've

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
committee going forward I know you've

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.970 
committee going forward I know you've
talked<00:03:35.760> about<00:03:36.000> adding<00:03:36.420> somebody<00:03:36.900> from<00:03:37.140> Texas

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
talked about adding somebody from Texas

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.200 
talked about adding somebody from Texas
the<00:03:38.130> South<00:03:38.310> someone<00:03:38.640> representing<00:03:39.090> your

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
the South someone representing your

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.510 
the South someone representing your
division<00:03:39.660> more<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.830> would<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.010> change<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
division more what would you change I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.130 
division more what would you change I
think<00:03:41.970> that'd<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.360> number<00:03:42.570> one<00:03:42.600> thing<00:03:42.900> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
think that'd be the number one thing you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.960 
think that'd be the number one thing you
know<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.380> just<00:03:43.740> think<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.610> know<00:03:44.700> they're

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
know I just think you know they're

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.220 
know I just think you know they're
dealing<00:03:45.300> with<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.540> whole<00:03:45.690> nations<00:03:46.140> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
dealing with the whole nations of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.570 
dealing with the whole nations of
committee<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.740> they're<00:03:47.070> in<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.220> tough<00:03:47.400> spot

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
committee and they're in a tough spot

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.550 
committee and they're in a tough spot
but<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.450> think<00:03:48.780> they're<00:03:48.930> certainly<00:03:49.260> needs

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
but I think they're certainly needs

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.010 
but I think they're certainly needs
equal<00:03:49.980> representation<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:51.570> know<00:03:51.690> throughout

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
equal representation you know throughout

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.530 
equal representation you know throughout
throughout<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.830> United<00:03:53.160> States<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:54.000> think

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
throughout the United States and I think

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.449 
throughout the United States and I think
if<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.750> looked<00:03:55.020> at<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.170> committee<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.370> know

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
if you looked at the committee you know

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.730 
if you looked at the committee you know
I<00:03:56.490> think<00:03:56.820> most<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.270> them<00:03:57.480> are<00:03:57.810> tied<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
I think most of them are tied up a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.140 
I think most of them are tied up a
little<00:03:58.950> bit<00:03:59.100> more<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.520> north<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.030> they

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
little bit more to the north and they

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.180 
little bit more to the north and they
are<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.540> south<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.050> now<00:04:01.709> Archie<00:04:02.040> Manning

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
are to the south and now Archie Manning

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.370

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
was on the committee and Archie would

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.350 
was on the committee and Archie would
have<00:04:04.500> been<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> great<00:04:04.860> voice<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:06.030> know<00:04:06.150> for
