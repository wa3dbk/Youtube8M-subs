00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
you know I got to show you the true

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.650 
you know I got to show you the true
contraption<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.319> made<00:00:04.560> now<00:00:04.740> stairs<00:00:05.660> it

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
contraption that I made now stairs it

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.750 
contraption that I made now stairs it
was<00:00:07.040> basically<00:00:08.040> built<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.400> contraption

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
was basically built a contraption

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.400 
was basically built a contraption
that'll<00:00:09.210> stop<00:00:09.800> Santa<00:00:11.000> stop<00:00:12.000> his<00:00:12.300> uh<00:00:12.330> his<00:00:12.840> soup

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that'll stop Santa stop his uh his soup

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
that'll stop Santa stop his uh his soup
from<00:00:14.160> activating<00:00:15.059> because<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.809> found<00:00:15.990> out<00:00:16.230> last

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
from activating because I found out last

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
from activating because I found out last
time<00:00:16.710> he<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:16.980> away<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.580> he<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> an

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
time he got away because he has a an

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.170 
time he got away because he has a an
electronic<00:00:19.650> device<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.310> his<00:00:20.640> belt<00:00:20.910> that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
electronic device on his belt that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
electronic device on his belt that
allows<00:00:21.420> him<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.689> teleport<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.100> found<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> way

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
allows him to teleport and I found a way

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.550 
allows him to teleport and I found a way
to<00:00:23.640> jam<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.240> built<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.660> downstairs<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.289> jams

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to jam it I built one downstairs it jams

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.229 
to jam it I built one downstairs it jams
all<00:00:25.769> frequencies<00:00:27.199> yeah<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.410> check<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.710> out

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.069

gonna<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.549> blown<00:01:05.760> away<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.150> device<00:01:06.570> man

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
gonna be blown away by this device man

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.760 
gonna be blown away by this device man
hey<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> took<00:01:08.010> me<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.400> long<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.880> build<00:01:12.770> yeah

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
hey it took me so long to build yeah

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.890 
hey it took me so long to build yeah
we'll<00:01:14.520> give<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> quick<00:01:15.000> explanation<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
we'll give you a quick explanation I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.310 
we'll give you a quick explanation I
just<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.439> old<00:01:17.340> devices<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.090> build<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
just use old devices to build this you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
just use old devices to build this you
know<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.270> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
know have this going here when it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
know have this going here when it's
ready<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> power<00:01:22.200> source<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.250> thing's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
ready it's the power source this thing's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
ready it's the power source this thing's
gonna<00:01:23.670> light<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
gonna light up and this over here is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.660 
gonna light up and this over here is
what<00:01:26.220> radiates<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.710> thing<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.400> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what radiates the thing and I actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
what radiates the thing and I actually
turn<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.420> through<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> amplifier<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> found

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
turn it on through the amplifier I found

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
turn it on through the amplifier I found
a<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> amplify<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:33.329> signal<00:01:34.759> yes<00:01:35.790> turns<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a way to amplify the signal yes turns on

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
a way to amplify the signal yes turns on
and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> hooked<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and I got it hooked up to one of the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.679 
and I got it hooked up to one of the
voice<00:01:38.850> modulators

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
voice modulators

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.399 
voice modulators
and<00:01:40.280> when<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.430> ready<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and when it's ready to go you see it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
and when it's ready to go you see it
basically<00:01:43.710> works<00:01:44.070> through<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.399> chip<00:01:44.700> right

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
basically works through that chip right

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.660 
basically works through that chip right
there<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.890> ready<00:01:47.040> boom<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
there you know it's ready boom the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
there you know it's ready boom the
lights<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.680> thing

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
lights on and that's the way this thing

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
lights on and that's the way this thing
works<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:50.729> leave<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.090> all

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
works and I'm just gonna leave it on all

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
works and I'm just gonna leave it on all
day<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.799> we're<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.250> what
