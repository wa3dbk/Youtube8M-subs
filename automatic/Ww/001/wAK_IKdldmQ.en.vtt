location so let's say I can search for
an<00:01:11.850> apple<00:01:12.090> store<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:16.759> do<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
an apple store I do that it's going to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.719 
an apple store I do that it's going to
drop<00:01:18.360> several<00:01:18.840> pins<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> map<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.580> can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
drop several pins in the map and you can

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.990

see<00:01:21.049> which<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> by<00:01:22.590> tapping<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
see which one is by tapping it you can

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
see which one is by tapping it you can
see<00:01:24.119> some<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.540> aren't<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:25.229> Apple

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
you can also collect a classic let's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.460 
you can also collect a classic let's
zoom<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.060> look<00:02:21.120> at<00:02:21.239> traffic

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.720 

you<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.739> here<00:02:26.010> all<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.569> traffic<00:02:27.569> reports

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you can see here all the traffic reports

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.780 
you can see here all the traffic reports
okay<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.790> how<00:02:30.000> about<00:02:30.090> directions<00:02:30.950> well<00:02:31.950> go<00:02:32.670> in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
okay so how about directions well go in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.369 
okay so how about directions well go in
here<00:02:32.940> will<00:02:33.060> switch<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.269> directions<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
here will switch the directions and you

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.309 
here will switch the directions and you
can<00:02:34.530> pick<00:02:34.620> two<00:02:34.860> locations<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:36.060> let's<00:02:36.870> say<00:02:37.140> I'm

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
can pick two locations so let's say I'm

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.460 
can pick two locations so let's say I'm
going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> look<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:39.110> way<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.290> from

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
going to look for a way to get from

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.539 
going to look for a way to get from
Coors<00:02:40.739> Field<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> specific<00:02:47.459> location<00:02:49.549> like

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
Coors Field to a specific location like

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.720 
Coors Field to a specific location like
say<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.150> apple<00:02:51.450> stores<00:02:55.579> it'll<00:02:56.579> pick

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
say one of these apple stores it'll pick

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.880 
say one of these apple stores it'll pick
one<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.030> them<00:02:57.120> here<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:58.140> will<00:02:58.170> draw<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> map

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
one of them here and it will draw a map

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.539 
one of them here and it will draw a map
to<00:02:59.129> it<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.760> can<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> directions<00:03:01.349> now

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
to it I can see the directions now

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.500 
to it I can see the directions now
Google<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.609> not<00:03:02.700> always<00:03:02.849> great<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.299> give<00:03:03.420> you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
Google is not always great and give you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.610 
Google is not always great and give you
directions<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.019> can<00:03:04.079> see<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.319> once<00:03:04.530> when

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
directions you can see here once when

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.080 
directions you can see here once when
you<00:03:04.709> get<00:03:04.829> on<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.950> highway<00:03:05.190> go<00:03:05.519> north<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.940> some

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you get on the highway go north for some

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
you get on the highway go north for some
reason<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.420> turn<00:03:06.569> around<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.769> be<00:03:07.859> able<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.069> get

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
reason and turn around to be able to get

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.030 
reason and turn around to be able to get
back<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:10.290> may<00:03:10.470> actually<00:03:10.680> be

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
back this way it may actually be

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.819 
back this way it may actually be
accurate<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.940> seems<00:03:12.239> like<00:03:12.590> perhaps<00:03:13.590> I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
accurate but it seems like perhaps I

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.009 
accurate but it seems like perhaps I
should<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.250> go<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.819> more<00:03:15.030> direct<00:03:15.359> route<00:03:15.660> I

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
should get to go the more direct route I

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.420 
should get to go the more direct route I
can<00:03:16.530> switch<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.769> public<00:03:17.099> transportation

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
can switch to public transportation

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.979 
can switch to public transportation
directions<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.239> can<00:03:21.389> even<00:03:21.480> switch<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
directions and I can even switch to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.250 
directions and I can even switch to
walking<00:03:22.500> directions<00:03:22.799> as<00:03:23.130> well<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.139> can

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
walking directions as well so you can

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.400 
walking directions as well so you can
see<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.709> does<00:03:26.250> save<00:03:26.549> past<00:03:27.269> searches<00:03:27.900> even

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
see it does save past searches even

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.500 
see it does save past searches even
direction<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.040> here's<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.549> set<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.269> directions

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
direction so here's a set of directions

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.900 
direction so here's a set of directions
that<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.349> did<00:03:31.500> recently<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.579> will<00:03:32.700> draw

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
that I did recently and it will draw

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.220 
that I did recently and it will draw
those<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.739> then<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.430> tap<00:03:36.359> on<00:03:36.540> start<00:03:37.019> here

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
those and then you can tap on start here

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.390 
those and then you can tap on start here
for<00:03:37.349> directions<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.859> will<00:03:38.040> actually<00:03:38.250> come<00:03:38.370> up

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
for directions and will actually come up

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.720 
for directions and will actually come up
with<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.609> list<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.769> display<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.250> first<00:03:41.489> step

you<00:03:42.090> can<00:03:42.120> go<00:03:42.299> through<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:43.319> each<00:03:43.560> step<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
you can go through that each step of the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.789 
you can go through that each step of the
drive<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.510> will<00:03:45.630> show<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.099> each<00:03:47.099> step<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:48.799> can

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
drive and will show you each step I can

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.979 
drive and will show you each step I can
switch<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.370> view<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.359> list<00:03:51.599> here<00:03:51.870> and
