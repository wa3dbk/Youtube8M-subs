factory this is the the food base liquid

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.569 
factory this is the the food base liquid
this<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.290> very<00:01:31.560> concentrated<00:01:31.829> very

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this very very very concentrated very

sure<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.670> give<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.970> really<00:03:37.239> good<00:03:37.390> shape

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
sure you give it a really good shape

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.090 
sure you give it a really good shape
because<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:38.020> not<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> huge<00:03:38.470> amount<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.800> liquid

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
because it's not a huge amount of liquid

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.470 
because it's not a huge amount of liquid
in<00:03:39.220> there<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.489> don't<00:03:39.640> want<00:03:39.760> too<00:03:40.000> much<00:03:40.209> liquid

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
in there you don't want too much liquid

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.970 
in there you don't want too much liquid
because<00:03:40.840> if<00:03:40.930> they<00:03:41.020> take<00:03:41.230> loads<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.739> loads<00:03:41.770> of

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
because if they take loads and loads of

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.170 
because if they take loads and loads of
liquid<00:03:42.280> on<00:03:42.400> they're<00:03:42.520> gonna<00:03:42.610> get<00:03:42.760> really<00:03:43.000> heavy

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
liquid on they're gonna get really heavy

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.000 
liquid on they're gonna get really heavy
and<00:03:43.300> they<00:03:43.540> won't<00:03:43.750> walk<00:03:44.200> properly<00:03:44.530> above<00:03:44.890> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and they won't walk properly above the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.710 
and they won't walk properly above the
hook<00:03:45.130> anymore<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.360> want<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.570> nice

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
hook anymore so you just want a nice

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.960 
hook anymore so you just want a nice
coating<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:52.330> there<00:03:52.510> we<00:03:52.600> go<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.410> I'll<00:03:53.680> show<00:03:53.860> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
coating and there we go so I'll show you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.720 
coating and there we go so I'll show you
how<00:03:54.970> they<00:03:55.120> look<00:03:55.150> now<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:57.010> how<00:03:57.459> they<00:03:57.610> look

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
how they look now and how they look

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.010 
how they look now and how they look
before<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:58.239> can<00:03:58.390> see<00:03:58.540> there's<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.810> real

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
before you can see there's a real

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.660 
before you can see there's a real
difference<00:03:59.260> I've<00:04:00.010> got<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.280> little<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.580> of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
difference I've got a little bit of

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.280 
difference I've got a little bit of
excess<00:04:00.970> liquid<00:04:01.390> there<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.930> take<00:04:02.140> these

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
excess liquid there you can take these

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.620 
excess liquid there you can take these
out<00:04:02.530> drain<00:04:03.220> them<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.790> other<00:04:03.970> option<00:04:04.390> is<00:04:04.450> to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
out drain them the other option is to

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.300 
out drain them the other option is to
use<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.930> rest<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.290> liquid<00:04:05.620> up<00:04:05.739> you<00:04:06.190> can

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
use the rest of the liquid up you can

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.350 
use the rest of the liquid up you can
add<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> few<00:04:06.640> more<00:04:06.700> hook<00:04:07.000> baits<00:04:09.180> screw<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.269> on

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
add a few more hook baits screw it on

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.880 
add a few more hook baits screw it on
tight<00:04:10.570> again<00:04:10.870> give<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.380> really<00:04:11.709> good<00:04:11.739> shake

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
tight again give it a really good shake

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.840 
tight again give it a really good shake
get<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.820> nice<00:04:12.970> even<00:04:13.209> coat

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.979 

and<00:04:17.850> these<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.150> got<00:04:18.269> some<00:04:18.420> real<00:04:18.600> pulling

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and these have got some real pulling

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.020 
and these have got some real pulling
power<00:04:19.170> now<00:04:19.440> some<00:04:19.680> serious<00:04:20.130> pulling<00:04:20.459> power<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
power now some serious pulling power the

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.820 
power now some serious pulling power the
neat<00:04:21.239> additive<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.260> there<00:04:22.410> we<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.710> can

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
neat additive and there we go you can

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.210 
neat additive and there we go you can
see<00:04:23.130> there<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:24.570> just<00:04:25.530> by<00:04:25.650> adding<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:26.100> little

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
see there and just by adding a little

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940 
see there and just by adding a little
bit<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> activator<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:27.560> they<00:04:28.560> smell

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
bit of the activator or they smell

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
bit of the activator or they smell
amazing<00:04:31.100> now<00:04:32.100> what<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.280> tend<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:32.670> with<00:04:32.820> mine

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
amazing now what I tend to do with mine

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.820 
amazing now what I tend to do with mine
is<00:04:33.120> I'll<00:04:33.240> get<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.390> whole<00:04:33.630> tub<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:34.020> wafters<00:04:34.530> I'll

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
is I'll get a whole tub of wafters I'll

these little mini clip lock boxes make

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.900 
these little mini clip lock boxes make
up<00:04:42.990> my<00:04:43.110> mix<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.650> these<00:04:44.160> have<00:04:44.340> been<00:04:44.490> sitting<00:04:44.730> in

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
up my mix and these have been sitting in

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.760 
up my mix and these have been sitting in
the<00:04:45.030> shed<00:04:45.240> now<00:04:45.450> for<00:04:45.750> about<00:04:45.960> two<00:04:46.170> months<00:04:46.410> and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
the shed now for about two months and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.660 
the shed now for about two months and
look<00:04:47.730> at<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.880> color<00:04:48.060> they've<00:04:48.270> gone<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:49.670> read

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
look at the color they've gone I read

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.290 
look at the color they've gone I read
they<00:04:50.880> were<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> guaranteed<00:04:53.010> by<00:04:53.580> done<00:04:54.060> so

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
they were like a guaranteed by done so

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.360 
they were like a guaranteed by done so
so<00:04:54.570> well<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:54.930> these<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:55.980> tip<00:04:56.130> them<00:04:56.340> off

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
so well on these you can tip them off

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.370 
so well on these you can tip them off
with<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.910> know<00:04:57.030> with<00:04:57.360> colors<00:04:57.660> if<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.900> need<00:04:58.140> to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
with you know with colors if you need to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.320 
with you know with colors if you need to
but<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.920> tend<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.520> not<00:04:59.610> bother<00:04:59.850> I<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.210> fish

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
but I tend to not bother I just fish

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.970 
but I tend to not bother I just fish
them<00:05:00.480> as<00:05:00.600> they<00:05:00.810> are<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.200> try<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.710> use<00:05:01.830> the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
them as they are and try and use the

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.800 
them as they are and try and use the
liquids<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.820> bit<00:05:02.970> of<00:05:03.060> extra<00:05:03.270> pulling<00:05:03.660> power

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
liquids for a bit of extra pulling power

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.120 
liquids for a bit of extra pulling power
rather<00:05:04.530> than<00:05:04.980> in<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> bright<00:05:05.730> colors
