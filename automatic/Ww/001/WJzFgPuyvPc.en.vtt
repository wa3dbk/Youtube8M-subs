since you know in our hectic schedules

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.120 
since you know in our hectic schedules
often<00:00:26.090> times<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:26.480> need<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.720> be<00:00:27.130> monitoring

often times you need to be monitoring

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.859 
often times you need to be monitoring
something<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:28.820> also<00:00:29.180> would<00:00:29.300> be<00:00:29.420> nice<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.720> do

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
something and also would be nice to do

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.210 
something and also would be nice to do
some<00:00:30.140> productive<00:00:30.530> work<00:00:30.680> at<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:30.890> same<00:00:31.010> time

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
some productive work at the same time

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.279 
some productive work at the same time
well<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.029> my<00:00:32.149> case<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:32.629> know<00:00:32.660> sometimes<00:00:33.170> I

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
well in my case you know sometimes I

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.810 
well in my case you know sometimes I
might<00:00:33.379> want<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.649> be<00:00:33.739> doing<00:00:34.250> something<00:00:34.550> on<00:00:34.760> the

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
might want to be doing something on the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.450 
might want to be doing something on the
CNC<00:00:35.120> machine<00:00:35.570> however<00:00:36.469> in<00:00:36.590> my<00:00:36.680> case<00:00:36.949> my<00:00:37.129> cnc

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
CNC machine however in my case my cnc

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.280 
CNC machine however in my case my cnc
machine<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.000> probably<00:00:38.360> 30<00:00:38.690> or<00:00:38.810> 40<00:00:39.110> feet<00:00:39.140> away

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
machine is probably 30 or 40 feet away

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.470 
machine is probably 30 or 40 feet away
from<00:00:39.500> here<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:41.000> know<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.149> can<00:00:41.329> get

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
from here so you know you can get

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.330 
from here so you know you can get
wireless<00:00:42.050> cameras<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:43.010> sort<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.280> thing

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
wireless cameras and that sort of thing

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.950 
wireless cameras and that sort of thing
to<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.180> know<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.480> can<00:00:44.600> keep<00:00:44.720> an<00:00:44.840> eye<00:00:44.930> on

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
to you know that you can keep an eye on

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.170 
to you know that you can keep an eye on
things<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:46.070> wanted<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.790> do<00:00:46.880> it<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
things but I wanted to do it on the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.840 
things but I wanted to do it on the
cheap<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.050> what<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:48.590> wanted<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.040> use<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.430> USB

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
cheap so what I wanted to use is a USB

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.330 
cheap so what I wanted to use is a USB
camera<00:00:50.059> now<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.930> course<00:00:51.079> USB<00:00:51.530> cabers<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.219> know

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
camera now of course USB cabers you know

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.330 
camera now of course USB cabers you know
their<00:00:52.850> range<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.989> limited<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.410> can<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.219> know

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
their range is limited you can you know

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.540 
their range is limited you can you know
maybe<00:00:55.520> get<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.690> know<00:00:56.809> 7<00:00:57.290> 14<00:00:57.800> feet<00:00:58.040> maybe<00:00:58.280> you

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
maybe get you know 7 14 feet maybe you

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.729 
maybe get you know 7 14 feet maybe you
can<00:00:58.670> buy<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.820> little<00:00:59.149> range<00:00:59.870> extenders<00:01:00.469> but

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
can buy a little range extenders but

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.130 
can buy a little range extenders but
usually<00:01:01.280> they're<00:01:01.370> quite<00:01:01.579> expensive<00:01:01.690> I<00:01:02.690> found

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
usually they're quite expensive I found

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.319 
usually they're quite expensive I found
the<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.950> optimal<00:01:04.369> solution<00:01:04.489> I<00:01:04.820> think<00:01:05.059> and

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
the the optimal solution I think and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.429 
the the optimal solution I think and
what<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.369> these<00:01:07.369> little<00:01:08.439> ethernet

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
what that is is these little ethernet

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.820 
what that is is these little ethernet
USB<00:01:09.760> extender<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:10.880> on<00:01:11.180> one<00:01:11.330> end<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.690> has<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:12.170> male

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
USB extender so on one end it has a male

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.039 
USB extender so on one end it has a male
and<00:01:12.979> female<00:01:13.280> connection<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.690> on<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.960> other

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
and female connection and on the other

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.359 
and female connection and on the other
end<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.409> just<00:01:15.470> basically<00:01:15.920> straight

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
end it's just basically straight

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.219 
end it's just basically straight
ethernet<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.180> go<00:01:17.360> up<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.780> 300<00:01:18.170> feet

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
ethernet so you can go up to 300 feet

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.100 
ethernet so you can go up to 300 feet
apart<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:18.770> these<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.750> allows<00:01:20.930> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
apart on these and and so it allows you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.050 
apart on these and and so it allows you
to<00:01:21.229> run<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.950> know<00:01:22.040> something<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:22.909> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
to run you know something like this is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.969 
to run you know something like this is
maybe<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.390> twenty<00:01:23.930> dollar<00:01:23.960> or<00:01:24.500> forty<00:01:24.799> dollar

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
maybe a twenty dollar or forty dollar

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.640 
maybe a twenty dollar or forty dollar
webcam<00:01:25.850> what<00:01:26.810> I'm<00:01:26.900> actually<00:01:27.110> running<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
webcam what I'm actually running on the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.200 
webcam what I'm actually running on the
other<00:01:27.770> end<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.070> ten-dollar<00:01:28.520> webcam<00:01:28.939> because

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
other end is a ten-dollar webcam because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.060 
other end is a ten-dollar webcam because
I'm<00:01:29.510> not<00:01:29.659> really<00:01:29.840> interested<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.439> a<00:01:30.590> super

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
I'm not really interested in a super

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.280 
I'm not really interested in a super
high<00:01:31.220> resolution<00:01:31.400> picture<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.049> want

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
high resolution picture just I just want

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.530 
high resolution picture just I just want
to<00:01:33.350> see<00:01:33.439> what's<00:01:33.619> happening<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:35.420> nice

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
to see what's happening and the nice

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.120 
to see what's happening and the nice
thing<00:01:35.570> about<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:36.710> I'm<00:01:36.860> going<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.040> be

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
thing about it is I'm going to be

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.760 
thing about it is I'm going to be
running<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.490> into<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.700> computer<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.590> also

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
running it into a computer so it also

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.740 
running it into a computer so it also
allows<00:01:40.220> me<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.490> monitor<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.000> on<00:01:41.210> on

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
allows me to monitor this on on

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.880 
allows me to monitor this on on
something<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.890> my<00:01:43.130> ipod<00:01:43.850> touch<00:01:44.030> here

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
something like like my ipod touch here

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.670 
something like like my ipod touch here
let's<00:01:45.890> take<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.070> look<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.310> see<00:01:46.400> how<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:46.640> works

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
let's take a look and see how it works

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.080 
let's take a look and see how it works
okay<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.070> my<00:01:49.100> laptop<00:01:49.369> computer<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
okay so this is my laptop computer and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.050 
okay so this is my laptop computer and
you<00:01:51.079> know<00:01:51.200> here's<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.619> design<00:01:51.920> here<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:53.030> I

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
you know here's the design here that I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.550 
you know here's the design here that I
would<00:01:53.479> like<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.720> be<00:01:53.810> cutting<00:01:54.049> on<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.320> CNC

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
would like to be cutting on the CNC

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.620 
would like to be cutting on the CNC
machine<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:56.270> basically<00:01:56.390> here's<00:01:57.520> USB<00:01:58.630> to

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
machine and so basically here's USB to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.399 
machine and so basically here's USB to
ethernet<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.689> side<00:02:02.720> let's

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
ethernet and this is on one side let's

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.539 
ethernet and this is on one side let's
go<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> other<00:02:03.740> site<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.220> see<00:02:04.340> what<00:02:04.460> we

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
go to the other site and see what we

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.309 
go to the other site and see what we
have<00:02:04.610> over<00:02:04.790> there<00:02:06.759> okay<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.970> here's<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.929> CNC

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
have over there okay and here's the CNC

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.039 
have over there okay and here's the CNC
machine<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.829> of<00:02:10.640> course<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.269> know<00:02:11.480> I've<00:02:11.780> just

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
machine and of course you know I've just

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.170 
machine and of course you know I've just
strung<00:02:12.319> us<00:02:12.470> along<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.189> to<00:02:13.909> get<00:02:14.059> things

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
strung us along here just to get things

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.509 
strung us along here just to get things
working<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:15.319> going<00:02:15.469> to<00:02:15.529> tidy<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.859> up<00:02:15.980> nice<00:02:16.489> and

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
working I'm going to tidy it up nice and

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.360 
working I'm going to tidy it up nice and
nice<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.419> neat<00:02:17.569> later<00:02:17.779> but<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.189> is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
nice and neat later but so this is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.750 
nice and neat later but so this is
the<00:02:19.489> other<00:02:19.730> end<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.120> cable<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.659> is<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the other end of the cable this is the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.280 
the other end of the cable this is the
ethernet<00:02:22.760> cable<00:02:23.090> goes<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.659> other<00:02:23.810> end<00:02:24.049> of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
ethernet cable goes to the other end of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.339 
ethernet cable goes to the other end of
this<00:02:24.530> adapter<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.430> plug<00:02:25.480> into<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> is

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
this adapter and plug into that is a is

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.470 
this adapter and plug into that is a is
a<00:02:28.040> webcam<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.120> basically

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
a webcam and that's just basically

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.690 
a webcam and that's just basically
coming<00:02:29.810> over<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> top<00:02:30.379> here<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.920> I've

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
coming over to the top here and I've

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.220 
coming over to the top here and I've
just<00:02:31.730> actually<00:02:32.269> just<00:02:32.450> ducked<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> air<00:02:33.019> just

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
just actually just ducked to air just

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.220 
just actually just ducked to air just
that<00:02:33.440> clear<00:02:34.220> taped<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.670> onto<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:35.870> metal

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that clear taped it onto this metal

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.569 
that clear taped it onto this metal
ducting<00:02:36.620> which<00:02:36.799> is<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.190> know<00:02:37.220> good<00:02:37.430> enough

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
ducting which is you know good enough

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.220 
ducting which is you know good enough
for<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:37.819> I'll<00:02:38.150> probably<00:02:38.329> put<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.629> nice<00:02:38.780> bracket

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
for now I'll probably put a nice bracket

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.170 
for now I'll probably put a nice bracket
on<00:02:39.349> there<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.519> point<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.819> get<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
on there and it's just point to get the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.930 
on there and it's just point to get the
the<00:02:41.209> CNC<00:02:41.930> machine<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.099> let<00:02:43.489> me<00:02:43.519> get<00:02:43.700> something

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the CNC machine so let me get something

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.910 
the CNC machine so let me get something
cutting<00:02:44.599> on<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.810> CNC<00:02:45.079> machine<00:02:45.470> will<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.799> into

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
cutting on the CNC machine will go into

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.309 
cutting on the CNC machine will go into
the<00:02:46.040> computer<00:02:46.459> room<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.760> we'll<00:02:47.599> take<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> look

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
the computer room and we'll take a look

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.660 
the computer room and we'll take a look
and<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:49.879> see

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
and you know see you see what we see

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.780 
and you know see you see what we see
okay<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:52.730> here<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.209> have<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.430> CNC<00:02:55.430> machine

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
okay so here we have the CNC machine

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.160 
okay so here we have the CNC machine
working<00:02:56.030> away

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.960 

let's<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.160> looks<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:06.069> ok<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
let's see what it looks like ok so the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.150 
let's see what it looks like ok so the
CNC<00:03:08.360> machine<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.780> running<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.140> can<00:03:09.349> you<00:03:10.040> know
