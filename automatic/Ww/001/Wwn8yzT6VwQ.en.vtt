00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 I do not even know what it means 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 but I wish you a warm welcome 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.260

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.850
 I have two more little information for you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.220
 comments writes a new format 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 1 25 come and thus became your whole 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 Comments said that regardless of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 on whatever sundays comes then always 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 Wednesday would come so the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 however, the finances cheer us up 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.649
 I would write comments like that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 could and could do anything for me 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.719
 I'll be serious too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 really serious and really answer 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 I'm on 5.10 in the bottrop 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.370
 there will probably be on sunday 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.719
 no succession comes I will 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.890
 in bottrop in the movie park since and then 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.240
 Can you shake my hand once? 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.939
 I do not give autographs with the first one 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 video from the biggest youtube annoyance 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.210
 whom I know 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 the speech is from prince show the am 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.830
 monday a web video has uploaded it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.830
 gives an anniversary 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.350
 when I was little, but one 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.450
 totally videos on all without the occasion 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.579
 the rap songs is that his channel now 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 two years old that's it too 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.720
 what the rap song is about 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.610
 He raps about how he is running 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.039
 the years changed and improved 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.049
 What is so awesome about it is 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.210
 that rap and the show 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.520
 just be very clear style and its 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.649
 to reproduce art he is and remains 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.810
 a silly but very personable 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.360
 acting tulip what, of course 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 it is noticeable that it already with the web 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.649
 it just sounds incredible 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.759
 good and is also free for download 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.830
 available 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.259
 So do not force yourself and give 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.409
 you the video of the link is like getting in 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.420
 the video description we do it 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.970
 same time musically further than that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.709
 jonas from judith tv also has this week 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.080
 a music video uploaded 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 I was once told there is no way to go 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 peace 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.410
 because peace is the way from this sentence 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.629
 nothing remained 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.290
 because in this world is nothing to 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.390
 I see see hate rage called the song 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.849
 means too much hate and describes 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.250
 social problems such as the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.290
 very pronounced egoism and the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.310
 sensationalism of the people over the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.769
 sorry of others 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 it is a very serious song all the way 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.269
 and not designed for that is good 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 whim for the listener to generate but 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.959
 rather to stimulate thought 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.840
 However, I have to say that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.920
 content of the song is very good indeed 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.380
 musically but definitely 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.569
 I would not want to be expandable 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.069
 say that sounds bad but 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.019
 only that it is not his 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.970
 Highest performance is because of me the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.459
 text and the very successful music video 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.190
 It has been very convincing in mine 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.900
 this week afx list landed the link 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.900
 is as always in the video description 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.819
 So because of what a pussy 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.099
 He makes such a theater because of such a 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.170
 tiny chili peppers and then 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.930
 he lies like a robbe on the ground and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.599
 cries for water what leads to yield 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.549
 But the best is mother teresa amber 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.010
 panick me out of the kitchen 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.079
 glass of water gets but runs into the bathroom 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.250
 and with her hands water gets as for 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.530
 such a little world 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.540
 I found that videos so funny that me 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.220
 I thought you have that here take a purely 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.780
 You should get the video on each one 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
 case, look at the link is like 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.459
 always in the video description 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 I was always wondering what 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.349
 The haters really mean if you have yours 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.510
 pointless comments among ours 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.250
 videos clap up to stupid 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:17.829
 I just understand the whole stock market 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:19.060
 not I think it's already 3 is that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.030
 just invent words 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.310
 thanks to fashion catastrophe finally someone 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.169
 found out what actually 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.150
 I mean, I've been there since 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.620
 longer busy as me with 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.960
 hater comments should handle 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.490
 I came across this video the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.680
 opened my eyes 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.960
 in the video she is very funny 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.430
 hater comments to what they do 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.860
 in reality, main 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.990
 if you are interested too 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.660

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.690

 last in the video description to good 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.300
 a video where you thought about it 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.710
 ok maybe think now or 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.699
 others are difficult here but today 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.889
 you've noticed that we 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.360
 the comic eating habits have the 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.760
 Eating earth resembles one 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.320
 neat food intake that you 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.449
 Fast food is a good example of this 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.090

 views to eat, for example, what he am 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.960
 Fastfood bothers you if you discuss 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.849
