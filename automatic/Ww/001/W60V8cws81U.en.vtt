00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
is Wilshire not the best defensively but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
like I said I didn't really go for pace

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.839 
like I said I didn't really go for pace
although<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> more<00:02:11.129> i<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.280> has<00:02:11.580> 82

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
although but the more i think has 82

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.920 
although but the more i think has 82
pace<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.510> bad

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
pace that's not bad

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.809

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
have Diego Alvarez was tremendous

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.550 
have Diego Alvarez was tremendous
reflexes<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.689> that's<00:02:15.840> why<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.049> went<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.439> him

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
reflexes and that's why I went for him

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.530 
reflexes and that's why I went for him
because<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:17.790> that's<00:02:17.969> important

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

helped the team loads and loads and then

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.479 
helped the team loads and loads and then
probably<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.500> final<00:04:17.859> was<00:04:17.979> hard<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.310> choose

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
probably the final was hard to choose

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.890 
probably the final was hard to choose
between<00:04:18.609> well<00:04:18.910> back<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.239> like<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.450> said<00:04:19.600> but<00:04:19.870> I

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
still had to go with black head because

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.580 
still had to go with black head because
he's<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.630> an<00:04:22.720> all-around<00:04:22.900> player<00:04:23.470> he's

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590
