know<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.390> people<00:01:45.659> will

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
know I think that a lot of people will

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
know I think that a lot of people will
like<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.460> even

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
like it and I think that you know even

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.240 
like it and I think that you know even
if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.810> logo<00:01:49.710> TV<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.070> your

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
if you don't get a logo TV on your

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
if you don't get a logo TV on your
carrier<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.790> certainly<00:01:51.119> obviously

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
carrier you're certainly obviously

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.789 
carrier you're certainly obviously
hearing<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.649> news

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hearing about it in a lot of news

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
hearing about it in a lot of news
outlets<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.340> maybe<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.790> encourage

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
outlets so maybe that will encourage

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
outlets so maybe that will encourage
people<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.420> either<00:01:54.659> watch<00:01:54.780> clips<00:01:55.110> online<00:01:55.290> or

people to either watch clips online or

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
people to either watch clips online or
subscribe<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.329> very

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
subscribe but I think it's very

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
subscribe but I think it's very
interesting<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.320> happened<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
interesting so what happened is the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.359 
interesting so what happened is the
couples<00:01:59.430> they<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.840> order<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:02.189> being

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
on the show in exchange for that they
got<00:02:03.869> their<00:02:04.020> therapy<00:02:04.380> sessions<00:02:04.409> paid<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
got their therapy sessions paid for and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
got their therapy sessions paid for and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.979 
they had a gay and lesbian couple
Christians<00:02:08.520> couples<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.330> couples<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.899> their

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.260 
Christians couples and couples in their
60s<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.890> ranging<00:02:11.310> across<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.849> sorts<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
60s so just ranging across all sorts of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.890 
60s so just ranging across all sorts of
different

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
different

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.330 
different
backgrounds<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:14.080> gender<00:02:14.680> orientation

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
backgrounds you know gender orientation

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.979 
backgrounds you know gender orientation
all<00:02:15.459> sorts<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.819> stuff<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.569> think<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> is

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
all sorts of stuff and I think it is

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.210 
all sorts of stuff and I think it is
great<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.409> allows<00:02:17.620> people<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.980> talk

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
great that it allows people to talk

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880 
great that it allows people to talk
about<00:02:18.459> sex<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.629> their<00:02:19.810> sex<00:02:20.049> lives<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.440> an<00:02:20.530> open

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
about sex and their sex lives in an open

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.710 
about sex and their sex lives in an open
non-judgmental<00:02:21.580> way<00:02:21.849> because<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.569> many

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
non-judgmental way because so many

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.140 
non-judgmental way because so many
people<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.349> all<00:02:23.620> sorts<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:24.099> hang-ups<00:02:24.819> about

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
people have all sorts of hang-ups about

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.180 
people have all sorts of hang-ups about

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
sex or ideals that they think they

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.619 
sex or ideals that they think they
should<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.400> performing<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:28.390> they're<00:02:28.510> not

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
should be performing to but they're not

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.360

holding<00:02:28.959> up<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.260> those<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:30.129> hard

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
holding up to those and it's hard

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.619 
holding up to those and it's hard
sometimes<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> real<00:02:31.390> conversation

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
sometimes to have a real conversation

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.470 
sometimes to have a real conversation
about<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.879> does<00:02:34.060> force

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
about that because it is it does force

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.089 
about that because it is it does force
you<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.599> be<00:02:34.780> vulnerable<00:02:34.959> but<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:35.620> least<00:02:35.799> when

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
you to be vulnerable but at least when

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.309 
you to be vulnerable but at least when
you're<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.209> know<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.390> can't<00:02:37.810> your<00:02:38.019> face

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.300 
lives yeah the one real regret that I
have<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.440> people<00:02:50.620> did<00:02:50.980> know

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
have is that the people did know

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.309 
have is that the people did know
beforehand<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:52.420> would<00:02:52.599> end<00:02:52.720> up<00:02:52.840> on<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.049> TV

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319

beforehand that it would end up on a TV
show<00:02:53.709> now<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.310> assume<00:02:54.579> they're<00:02:54.970> still<00:02:55.150> gonna<00:02:55.239> be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420

show now I assume they're still gonna be
pretty<00:02:55.720> real<00:02:56.049> but<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.349> kind<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.650> wish<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:57.069> like

like<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.470> be<00:02:59.620> you<00:03:00.099> know<00:03:00.190> available<00:03:00.670> but

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
like this to be you know available but

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.130 
like this to be you know available but
because<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.209> business<00:03:01.359> transaction<00:03:02.019> of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
because of the business transaction of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
because of the business transaction of
them<00:03:02.410> getting<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.859> therapy<00:03:03.250> paid<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.670> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
them getting the therapy paid for that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.430 
them getting the therapy paid for that
couldn't<00:03:04.060> happen<00:03:04.180> unfortunately<00:03:04.450> maybe<00:03:05.290> in

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
couldn't happen unfortunately maybe in

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.770 
couldn't happen unfortunately maybe in
future<00:03:05.739> seasons<00:03:06.069> but<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.120> really<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.629> this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
future seasons but I really like this

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.809 
future seasons but I really like this
idea<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.230> think<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:09.160> an<00:03:09.310> interesting

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
idea I think it's an interesting

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.020

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
with so it's like this weird spinning

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.970 
with so it's like this weird spinning
circle<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.579> entertainment<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.180> reality<00:03:25.980> you

circle of entertainment in reality you
can't<00:03:27.160> blame<00:03:27.370> them<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.609> wanting<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
can't blame them for wanting to have the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.089 
can't blame them for wanting to have the
puppets<00:03:29.019> instead<00:03:29.319> of<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.500> people<00:03:29.859> yeah

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
puppets instead of the people yeah

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.559 
puppets instead of the people yeah
that's<00:03:30.310> true<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.700> maybe<00:03:30.819> like<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.269> said<00:03:31.450> it

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
that's true and maybe like you said it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.729 
that's true and maybe like you said it
might<00:03:31.959> make<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.230> actually<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> little<00:03:32.650> more

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
might make it actually a little more

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.229 
might make it actually a little more
interesting<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.430> have<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.669> puppets<00:03:34.000> than<00:03:34.150> to

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
interesting to have the puppets than to

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.640 
interesting to have the puppets than to
have<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.480> actual<00:03:34.750> people's<00:03:35.049> faces<00:03:35.260> because

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
have the actual people's faces because

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.900 
have the actual people's faces because
it<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.889> such<00:03:36.130> an<00:03:36.250> interesting<00:03:36.549> juxtaposition

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
it is such an interesting juxtaposition

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.059 
it is such an interesting juxtaposition
of<00:03:37.510> your<00:03:37.660> thinking<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.290> mean<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> puppets

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
of your thinking of I mean a puppets

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.710 
of your thinking of I mean a puppets
probably<00:03:39.519> remind<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.030> Sesame<00:03:40.389> Street<00:03:40.630> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
probably remind you of Sesame Street and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.990 
probably remind you of Sesame Street and
all<00:03:40.840> these<00:03:40.959> childhood<00:03:41.440> memories<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.340> kind<00:03:42.910> of

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
all these childhood memories and kind of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.180 
all these childhood memories and kind of
a<00:03:43.090> more<00:03:43.329> lighthearted<00:03:43.599> less<00:03:44.169> serious<00:03:44.650> topic

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
a more lighthearted less serious topic

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.159 
a more lighthearted less serious topic
so<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.760> think<00:03:45.910> maybe<00:03:46.269> people<00:03:46.540> will<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.900> able<00:03:46.959> to

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
so I think maybe people will be able to

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.300 
so I think maybe people will be able to
relate<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.470> little<00:03:47.620> bit<00:03:47.859> better<00:03:47.980> when<00:03:48.220> they're

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
relate a little bit better when they're

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.440 
relate a little bit better when they're
talking<00:03:48.549> these<00:03:48.819> awkward<00:03:49.269> uncomfortable

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
talking these awkward uncomfortable

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.990 
talking these awkward uncomfortable
aspects<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.620> Jackson<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.310> they<00:03:51.519> were<00:03:51.669> talking

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
aspects of Jackson and they were talking

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.309
