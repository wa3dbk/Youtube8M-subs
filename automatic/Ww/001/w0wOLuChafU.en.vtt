00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 This story is the story as 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 I want you to know what happened to me 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.610
 I need you to believe it, I just want you to 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.340
 listen because I'm still traumatized and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.170
 I can not get it out of my head 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 I remember that my parents were not in the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.190
 house that day so I decided to go out to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 buy the game of gta liberty city 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.769
 stories since I'm a gta fan 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.170
 iv had the whole saga complete - that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 game I left my house to the store 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.160
 game to see if it was the liberty city 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.009
 I asked the man who took care of me 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 how much for the game and he answered me that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.960
 it does not matter to us, take it with me 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.090
 so I had the game I took it I went to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 my house as fast as I could I got there and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.120
 connect my old play station2 and I put the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 game but how weird nothing came out but 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 on the screen came a warning that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.840
 He said we are not responsible for your 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 life since this version of the game can 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 not be suitable for you because it is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.680
 damn the game you want to accept it I'll 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.899
 I accepted thinking it was a joke or something 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 well to scare the player 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.040
 another weird thing that I realized is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 that no introduction or 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.120
 neither the main credits 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.700
 but it directly started the game and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.860
 I was controlling the protagonist but 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.980
 Like I started to play as if nothing and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.690
 that I thought was a minor detail 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.580
 before starting with the missions I wanted to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.740
 put some tricks to hang out 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.050
 and explore the map so after 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.610
 look for some on the internet I put the trick 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.560
 of advancing the time but 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 immediately after having put 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 the trick the protagonist had died 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.800
 out of nowhere since no one had 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 shot or hit or any other 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.360
 thing so I thought I got confused in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 place to put the time trick had 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 put the trick of committing suicide but I did not 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 I fixed it well and I put the time trick 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.259
 but the protagonist died of all 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.750
 ways so I thought I got the wrong 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 information or something like that but after 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.070
 that game made me weird like 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 custom in the saga I appeared in front of the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.240
 hospital but all pedestrians and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 cars were missing I was 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.800
 only then I realized that on the radar 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 appeared the icon of unare I thought that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.239
 everything was a mistake but I still headed 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.709
 to the location of the letter the weird 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.600
 it was also that the one that was in a 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.540
 blood red color but I do not 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.939
 imported 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 I looked at the map the location of the 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.349
 letter and it turns out that the location was 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.599
 in the observatory of ions and velez and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.180
 if you know the game you will know that it is a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.040
 inaccessible place on the map and there it was 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 when I realized that the other islands 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.819
 they were unlocked which should 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 be impossible since to unlock 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.799
 you should spend a few missions 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.540
 everything was strange for me it was still 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.659
 find people or drivers in the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.579
 I was playing alone after trying 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.489
 almost two hours I arrived at the observatory 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.590
 that 's where he was the good 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.959
 to start the mission I placed in the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 red marker and then I realized 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.099
 that mission had no name where it 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.049
 supposed that the title had to appear 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.090
 of the mission was all black but 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.099
 good to continue as if nothing and the mission 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.560
 it consisted of getting off the observatory and 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.480
 going back to the city ​​once there I gave myself 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.669
 account that all the people and all 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.739
 drivers appeared again but already 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.540
 everything was very different everyone wanted 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.480
 kill the protagonist and the mission 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.760
 it consisted in killing all pedestrians 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.650
 I had never seen that mission but still 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.170
 so I put the trick on weapons and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.720
 I killed everyone easily with the mini gum 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.940
 but something very strange happened the mission does 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.420
 very easily as if pedestrians 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.730
 they would like to be killed they left me 20 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.170
 I wanted to start the game again but at 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.390
 start the game before the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.520
 his character was very different 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.830
 skin was gray was stained by 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.200
 blood and his eyes were completely 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.540
 whites giving me the impression that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.120
 I was a zombie I regret having 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.000
 turned on the game again he put the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.980
 black screen like for 30 seconds already 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.510
 I was going to get up to restart the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.580
 console because I thought that it had 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.380
 locked the game but when I was by 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.920
 press the button to turn off the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.870
 console came out some letters that said 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.370
 warning you have rebooted the console on 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.850
 protagonist has died and has 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.799
 become a zombie you will regret 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.900
 scared try to turn off the console but 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.630
 nothing happened, he continued as if he did not 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.400
 I would have turned off the same thing 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.680
 unplugging the good keep playing 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.139
 note that the game was now normal 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.690
 - the protagonist who was still the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.210
 same zombie I spent the whole game with 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.710
 the zombie and I wanted to see what happened next 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 the end of the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.759
 and all the people and all the cars 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.310
 they disappeared again as if nothing 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.289
 now the protagonist was again the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.419
 same as always but after about 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.210
 seconds all the people appeared 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.310
 they were all zombies and they were all chasing 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.069
 my protagonist as if they wanted it 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.139
 eat or something like that and he put on the screen 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.930
 black with a text that said all the 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.030
 people are zombies want revenge if 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.610
 they kill tony cyprian and something will happen to you 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.560
 bad then appears with tony cipriani and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.630
 all the zombies on the island of portland 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.880
 all the zombies were approaching tony 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.130
 slowly I wanted to move but toni no 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.229
 he answered he would sit still and not 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.840
 case to the movements that I made with 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.910
 the joystick little by little they were approaching 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.009
 tom and I scared by the message that 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.740
 I would say if something bad happened to me I would 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.410
 happen to me then little by little they ate 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.659
 everything looked like blood came out and 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.460
 the body parts of Tony and after 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.770
 that the zombies ate it 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.740
 they turned to me and said now they 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.449
 It touches you I was tremendously 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.669
 scared I grabbed a hammer and broke the 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.569
 console in a thousand pieces but the zombies 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.300
 they were still on the TV watching 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.159
 fixedly then I decided to leave my 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.830
 house but I noticed that someone had 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.110
 locked in my room 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.629
 then the zombies began to leave one 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.349
 for one of the television they grabbed me and I 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.349
 they took with them
