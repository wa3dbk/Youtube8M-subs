00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
Nietzsche but I'm looking for a machine

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
Nietzsche but I'm looking for a machine
to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> number<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.760> machine<00:00:36.120> well<00:00:36.989> enough

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to be my number one machine well enough

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
to be my number one machine well enough
of<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.520> why<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.730> made<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.270> video

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of that this is why I made this video

of that this is why I made this video
because<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:42.510> machine<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> book<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
because this machine was a book of the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
because this machine was a book of the
three<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> come<00:00:44.700> across<00:00:44.820> machines<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
three when I come across machines that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.990 
three when I come across machines that
are<00:00:45.719> book<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> thread<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> come<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
are book of the thread I have to come to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.139 
are book of the thread I have to come to
the<00:00:48.090> YouTube<00:00:48.450> community<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> show<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.530> guys

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
let's look at this first you take your

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.740 
let's look at this first you take your
three<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.250> mine's<00:00:59.489> going<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> way

that's<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.080> coming<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:07.979> um

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that's really coming from the back um

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.260 
that's really coming from the back um
I've<00:01:10.530> threaded<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> couple<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> times<00:01:11.850> from

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I've threaded it a couple of times from

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
I've threaded it a couple of times from
the<00:01:12.390> front<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:14.580> kept<00:01:15.000> getting<00:01:18.830> snagged

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the front and I kept getting snagged

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
the front and I kept getting snagged
down<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:22.700> want<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.030> say<00:01:24.240> because

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
down in here so I want to say because

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
down in here so I want to say because
I've<00:01:24.750> worked<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> certain<00:01:25.799> number<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I've worked with a certain number of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
I've worked with a certain number of
machines<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> sometimes<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> doesn't<00:01:27.810> matter

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
machines and sometimes it doesn't matter

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
machines and sometimes it doesn't matter
whether<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> front<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
whether you do it from the front or the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.649 
whether you do it from the front or the
back<00:01:29.930> but<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.549> did<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> front<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.420> mean

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
back but I did it for the front I mean

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 
back but I did it for the front I mean
from<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> back<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> three

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
from the back as you can see this three

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
from the back as you can see this three
is<00:01:35.970> coming<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> bag<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> white<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is coming from the bag it's a white and

is coming from the bag it's a white and
it's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> white<00:01:38.310> background<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.119> from

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it's a white background for this from

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's a white background for this from
the<00:01:39.360> back<00:01:39.740> okay<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.240> brought<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.920> guy<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the back okay I brought it to this guy I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
the back okay I brought it to this guy I
did<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> loop<00:01:47.149> next<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:49.369> came<00:01:51.860> behind<00:01:54.229> this

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
did the loop next I came behind this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.090 
did the loop next I came behind this
with<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> three<00:01:56.210> hour<00:01:57.680> did<00:01:59.869> around<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.380> hey

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
with the three hour did around so hey

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.200 
with the three hour did around so hey
look<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.610> come<00:02:03.060> behind<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.659> guy<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:05.210> come

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
look I come behind this guy I come

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.859 
look I come behind this guy I come
around

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
around

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.119 
around
I<00:02:07.580> put<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> three

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
I put the three

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.009 
I put the three
it's<00:02:11.430> kind<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> tricky<00:02:11.969> but<00:02:12.329> I<00:02:12.420> put<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.719> thread

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
it's kind of tricky but I put the thread

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's kind of tricky but I put the thread
around<00:02:13.909> through<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:17.090> loop<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.680> then<00:02:19.680> fit<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
around through this loop and then fit it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.459 
around through this loop and then fit it
through<00:02:20.489> here<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.790> through<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.239> loop<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
through here and through this loop and

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.479 
through here and through this loop and
keep<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.250> mind<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.609> do<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.390> adjust<00:02:28.049> this

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
keep in mind you do have to adjust this

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.520 
keep in mind you do have to adjust this
to<00:02:29.489> make<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.359> height<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.200> want

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
to make this to the height that you want

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.330 
to make this to the height that you want
it<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.159> always<00:02:32.459> do<00:02:32.670> mine<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.930> high

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it and I always do mine is this high

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.440 
it and I always do mine is this high
just<00:02:35.340> high<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.720> once<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.829> do<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.450> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
just high and then once you do that you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.030
