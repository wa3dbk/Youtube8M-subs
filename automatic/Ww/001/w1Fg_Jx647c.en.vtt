using this for a little bit over two
years<00:00:38.800> now<00:00:38.949> and<00:00:39.809> obviously<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.379> option<00:00:41.800> has

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
years now and obviously the option has

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.190 
years now and obviously the option has
come<00:00:42.190> up<00:00:42.310> to<00:00:42.430> upgrade<00:00:42.820> iphone<00:00:43.360> 6<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:43.989> being

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
and the common thread seems to be that

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.190 
and the common thread seems to be that
iphone<00:00:57.130> didn't<00:00:57.399> really<00:00:57.850> upgrade<00:00:58.480> like<00:00:59.079> you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
iphone didn't really upgrade like you

iphone didn't really upgrade like you
can<00:00:59.350> say<00:00:59.530> most<00:00:59.770> of<00:00:59.920> its<00:01:00.750> hardware

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
can say most of its hardware

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.650 
can say most of its hardware
capabilities<00:01:02.610> just<00:01:03.610> capabilities<00:01:04.180> overall

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
capabilities just capabilities overall

with the phone and there are many

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.810 
with the phone and there are many
androids<00:01:07.300> that<00:01:07.360> are<00:01:07.600> far<00:01:08.020> superior<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.729> in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
would say regardless is the fact that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.960 
would say regardless is the fact that
Apple<00:01:17.320> or<00:01:17.590> iPhone<00:01:18.159> I've<00:01:18.340> always<00:01:18.520> found<00:01:18.729> this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
Apple or iPhone I've always found this

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.969 
Apple or iPhone I've always found this
simple<00:01:19.360> I've<00:01:19.659> never<00:01:19.930> come<00:01:20.110> across<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.409> scenario

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
simple I've never come across a scenario

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.770 
simple I've never come across a scenario
I've<00:01:21.640> had<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.240> think<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.630> my

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
I've had this is I think this is my

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.580 
I've had this is I think this is my
third<00:01:23.140> generation<00:01:23.799> iphone<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:25.350> I've<00:01:26.350> never

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
third generation iphone and I've never

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.830 
third generation iphone and I've never
come<00:01:26.770> across<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:27.100> scenario<00:01:27.700> where<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:28.210> can't<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
come across a scenario where I can't the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.899 
come across a scenario where I can't the
phone<00:01:29.020> can't<00:01:29.320> do<00:01:29.530> what<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.770> wanted<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.159> do<00:01:30.400> I've

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
phone can't do what I wanted to do I've

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.539 
phone can't do what I wanted to do I've
never<00:01:31.090> lacked<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.570> features<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.290> while<00:01:33.070> I

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
never lacked for features so while I

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.760 
never lacked for features so while I
guess<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.240> could<00:01:34.270> say<00:01:34.570> android<00:01:35.260> has<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.409> ton

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
guess you could say android has a ton

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.789 
guess you could say android has a ton
more<00:01:36.040> features<00:01:36.490> or<00:01:36.670> apparently<00:01:37.180> i<00:01:37.439> still<00:01:38.439> i

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
more features or apparently i still i

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.179 
more features or apparently i still i
