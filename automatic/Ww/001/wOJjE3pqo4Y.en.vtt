my videos you know hopefully it's just
one<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.220> those<00:04:54.280> ads<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.700> you<00:04:54.820> can<00:04:54.940> just<00:04:55.090> skip

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
one of those ads that you can just skip

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.900 
one of those ads that you can just skip
in<00:04:55.900> five<00:04:56.140> seconds<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.770> way<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.790> know<00:04:57.880> i

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
in five seconds so that way you know i

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.670 
in five seconds so that way you know i
have<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.210> wait<00:04:58.330> for<00:04:58.360> too<00:04:58.690> long<00:04:58.870> or<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.560> can

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
have to wait for too long or you can

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.930 
have to wait for too long or you can
just<00:04:59.770> get<00:04:59.950> a<00:04:59.980> diblock<00:05:00.310> or<00:05:00.520> something<00:05:00.850> like

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
just get a diblock or something like

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.720 
just get a diblock or something like
that<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.390> basically<00:05:02.200> I'll<00:05:02.860> be<00:05:03.070> monetized<00:05:03.550> now

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
that but basically I'll be monetized now

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.010 
that but basically I'll be monetized now
so<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.360> said<00:05:04.420> hopefully<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.900> doesn't

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
so like I said hopefully that doesn't

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.470 
so like I said hopefully that doesn't
bother<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.500> guys<00:05:05.820> other<00:05:06.820> than<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.150> how's
