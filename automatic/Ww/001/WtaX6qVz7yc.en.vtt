00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.370
 Today I want to tell you how very 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.309
 simply 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 twist the hell which is usually very 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.269
 hard spinning through the meat grinder if 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 twist here so long back then 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:34.160
 they get stuck due to the fact that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 long fibers i fill at the same time 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.989
 garlic and observing I realized that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.500
 very short garlic let it go in 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 so I decided that every horseradish root 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 need to cut into the same small 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.820
 pieces that is, you need to know the measure for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 of each process and then they are very easy 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.630
 one by one turns note how 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 I twist easily 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 observant wonderful we 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.200

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.060
