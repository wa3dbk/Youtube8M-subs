to then begin induction of the schmayman
organizer<00:00:19.640> let's<00:00:20.640> rewrite<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.420> I'm

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
organizer let's rewrite this and I'm

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.429 
organizer let's rewrite this and I'm
going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> draw<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:23.720> kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:24.990> overall

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
going to draw out now kind of an overall

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
going to draw out now kind of an overall
thing<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.250> will<00:00:26.400> lead<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.119> ship<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
thing that will lead to the ship and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.589 
thing that will lead to the ship and
want<00:00:27.539> organizer<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> very

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
want organizer so from the very

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.670 
want organizer so from the very
beginning<00:00:32.930> after<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> new<00:00:34.469> coupe

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
beginning after we have the new coupe

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.630 
beginning after we have the new coupe
Center<00:00:35.010> present<00:00:36.230> we're<00:00:37.230> gonna<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.559> veg<00:00:37.860> T

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.000 

plus<00:00:41.640> beta<00:00:42.180> Katina<00:00:46.219> will<00:00:47.219> lead<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
plus beta Katina will lead to the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.139 
plus beta Katina will lead to the
production<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.460> Simoes<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.820> twin<00:00:55.850> at<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
production of Simoes and twin at the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
production of Simoes and twin at the
same<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.750> remember<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.010> now<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> bunch

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
same time remember we have now a bunch

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.429 
same time remember we have now a bunch
of<00:00:59.820> zonal<00:01:00.449> related<00:01:00.809> proteins<00:01:01.260> expressed<00:01:01.469> here

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
of zonal related proteins expressed here

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
of zonal related proteins expressed here
zonal<00:01:04.439> earth<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.400> oedipus<00:01:05.850> nodal<00:01:06.299> related

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
zonal earth is oedipus nodal related

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
zonal earth is oedipus nodal related
proteins<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> then

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
proteins are going to go and then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.000 
proteins are going to go and then
produce<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.820> products<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> tgf-beta

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
produce the products of the tgf-beta

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
produce the products of the tgf-beta
pathway<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.280> remember<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pathway because remember all this is is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
pathway because remember all this is is
a<00:01:16.500> tgf-beta<00:01:18.979> ligand<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.070> happens

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a tgf-beta ligand and what happens

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.620 
a tgf-beta ligand and what happens
downstream<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:24.240> tgf-beta<00:01:24.750> ligands<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.590> smads

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
downstream of tgf-beta ligands are smads

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
downstream of tgf-beta ligands are smads
which<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:28.080> transcription<00:01:28.829> factors<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
which are also transcription factors so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.450 
which are also transcription factors so
we<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.390> activated<00:01:30.840> smads<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.680> activated

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
we have activated smads and activated

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.969 
we have activated smads and activated
Simoes<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> twin<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.560> happens<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Simoes and twin and just so happens that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
Simoes and twin and just so happens that
these<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.460> located<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.960> same<00:01:37.140> place

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
these are all located in the same place

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.120 
these are all located in the same place
right<00:01:37.710> around<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:39.590> going<00:01:40.590> earlier<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.040> have

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
right around here going earlier we have

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
right around here going earlier we have
high<00:01:41.310> beta<00:01:41.520> catenin<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.630> edge<00:01:42.810> T<00:01:43.170> L<00:01:43.350> here

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
high beta catenin we have edge T L here

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.850 
high beta catenin we have edge T L here
and<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:45.000> high<00:01:45.360> zonal<00:01:45.960> zenefits

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and now we have high zonal zenefits

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.910 
and now we have high zonal zenefits
nodal<00:01:47.280> related<00:01:47.610> proteins<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:50.000> these<00:01:51.000> two

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
nodal related proteins there these two

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
nodal related proteins there these two
transcription<00:01:52.920> factors

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
transcription factors

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340 
transcription factors
tf4<00:01:56.170> transcription<00:01:56.710> factor<00:01:57.810> will<00:01:58.810> now<00:01:58.930> come

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
tf4 transcription factor will now come

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.069 
tf4 transcription factor will now come
together<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:02.880> lead<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.509> transcription

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
together and lead to the transcription

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:14.610 
together and lead to the transcription
of<00:02:05.170> goose<00:02:05.409> koi<00:02:11.459> goose<00:02:12.459> koi<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:14.200> will<00:02:14.530> be

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
of goose koi goose koi is then will be

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:25.830 
of goose koi goose koi is then will be
highly<00:02:15.480> expressed<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:20.200> region

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.000 

now<00:02:26.840> let's<00:02:27.049> end<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.290> at<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> time<00:02:27.769> point

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
now let's end this at the time point

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.649 
now let's end this at the time point
earlier<00:02:28.519> we<00:02:28.700> said<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.000> new<00:02:29.120> coupe<00:02:29.330> Center

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
earlier we said the new coupe Center

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.470 
earlier we said the new coupe Center
happens<00:02:30.019> around<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.409> 32<00:02:30.920> cell<00:02:31.189> stage<00:02:31.489> this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
happens around the 32 cell stage this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.289 
happens around the 32 cell stage this
this<00:02:33.079> frame<00:02:33.319> on<00:02:33.470> organizer<00:02:34.099> it's<00:02:34.939> going<00:02:35.209> to

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
this frame on organizer it's going to

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.729 
this frame on organizer it's going to
happen<00:02:35.480> at<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.620> mid<00:02:36.829> blastula<00:02:37.280> transition<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
happen at the mid blastula transition so

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:50.380 
happen at the mid blastula transition so
mid<00:02:40.510> blastula<00:02:44.110> transition<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.120> when

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
mid blastula transition and that's when

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.030 
mid blastula transition and that's when
all<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.200> happen<00:02:51.349> we<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:51.769> mid

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
all this is going to happen we see mid

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.250 
all this is going to happen we see mid
flash<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.459> transition<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.269> when<00:02:53.989> we<00:02:54.079> have

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
flash of the transition is when we have

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.559 
flash of the transition is when we have
a<00:02:54.290> lot<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.790> transcription<00:02:55.790> factors<00:02:55.819> acting

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
a lot of transcription factors acting

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.619 
a lot of transcription factors acting
and<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.430> an<00:02:58.519> important<00:02:58.909> time<00:02:59.090> points<00:02:59.510> in

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
and this is an important time points in

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.920 
and this is an important time points in
Xenakis<00:03:00.109> because<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.250> after<00:03:01.730> 12<00:03:02.180> divisions

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.930 

which<00:03:05.930> ultimately<00:03:06.200> leads<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:07.010> thousands<00:03:07.849> of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
which ultimately leads to thousands of

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.390 
which ultimately leads to thousands of
cells<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.810> we're<00:03:09.019> no<00:03:09.139> longer<00:03:09.349> just<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.099> 32

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
cells so we're no longer just in the 32

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.569

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
so the equal presence of Samos and SMAT

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.970 
so the equal presence of Samos and SMAT
as<00:05:01.880> transcription<00:05:02.810> factors<00:05:03.320> lead<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.620> goose

begin<00:06:09.009> gastrulation<00:06:09.849> after<00:06:10.360> that<00:06:10.509> so<00:06:11.229> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
begin gastrulation after that so the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.329 
begin gastrulation after that so the
German<00:06:11.799> lawyers<00:06:12.069> have<00:06:12.399> all<00:06:12.579> been<00:06:12.759> established

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
German lawyers have all been established

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:18.389 
German lawyers have all been established
by<00:06:15.339> this<00:06:15.399> point<00:06:15.849> and<00:06:16.349> we<00:06:17.349> have<00:06:17.559> the<00:06:17.919> signaling

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:18.399 
by this point and we have the signaling

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.989 
by this point and we have the signaling
that<00:06:18.489> leads<00:06:18.759> to<00:06:19.059> where<00:06:19.299> our<00:06:19.619> organizers<00:06:20.619> are

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:20.999 
that leads to where our organizers are

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.429 
that leads to where our organizers are
so<00:06:21.999> originally<00:06:22.479> we<00:06:22.569> had<00:06:22.659> three<00:06:22.899> crescents

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
so originally we had three crescents

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:29.299 
so originally we had three crescents
then<00:06:24.119> the<00:06:26.639> new<00:06:27.639> coupe<00:06:27.849> Center<00:06:28.209> and<00:06:28.419> then

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
then the new coupe Center and then

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:34.559 
then the new coupe Center and then
finally<00:06:30.309> the<00:06:30.519> same<00:06:30.969> on<00:06:31.149> organizer<00:06:33.329> one<00:06:34.329> last
