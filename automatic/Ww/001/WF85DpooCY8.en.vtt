 let's start the game of guides of 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.189
 war to see what happens 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.420

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.420
 after the preparation and I started what 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:37.150
 massa that is a good area we're going 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.150
 letter because obviously we have all 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.770
 Other figures that are in your position 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.030
 one area and made three attacks 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.030
 the first good with the chainsaw 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.940
 the auguries 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.329
 good 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.060
 this thing that take away an accountant 12 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 We use 4 to 2 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 1 2 3 4 5 5 in the good shot 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 two 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.250
 4 if you had something surprise 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.920
 it has not been bad start and intelligence 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.870
 nutrition do not look says group general 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.780
 if there is one more what we use movements 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.210
 or less of you 1 2 not if it is not so generated 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.000
 a locus b 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.830
 in the map output below 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.979
 all the wolves move an area towards 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.979
 you 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.649
 this yes clear 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 do not 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.520
 and I to these instances 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.480
 know where is that two what calculates 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.910
 nothing with the grenade what it says 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.530
 man if I put the grenade as good 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.390
 here he does a maximum of two treats if 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.800
 it does not make much sense that they oppose 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.060
 but teach one but you can do more 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.040
 when he knows he is one with the grenade and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.460
 another one I have one that up to happen and 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.990
 then move me also move and good 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.820
 you can leave it even though these are here 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.410
 good made maximum disappearance that 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.410
 You can tell them is him 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.180
 but the attacks 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.850
 1 2 3 4 5 saw as the most he has 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.850
 each one 2 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.580
 there's nothing like 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.580
 go grenades 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.680
 group boomers boomers we have 11 if there 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.910
 one more boom in at stake all 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.459
 boomers move an area towards the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.810
 figure of the closest area and then the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.230
 attack if they have line of sight towards 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.569
 she who have no missions to get 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.930
 here as is the rule of this corner 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:42.360
 to get to this corner but for free 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.760
 for me that good here wall 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:51.390
 If I can be attacked by you, right 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.390
 it has opened for me 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.650
 can not be well touched back to 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.650
 matos 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.730
 the works and accounts with the I'm 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.569
 functions 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 2 3 to 4 new units 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.930
 I will throw again two of battery 42 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:34.660
 1 2 3 4 and 2 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.660
 Of course I lose two cards 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.849
 I do not like ham 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.009
 and two out 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.599
 what else do you know 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.599
 I can make move 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.220
 little brother 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.899
 but our station is a little bit 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.800
 that are 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.210
 the downside we say crazy is attack 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.210
 at any distance 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.670
 a big hug 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:46.900
 from here it arrives with the grenades 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.840
 yes but I do not know what is resolved 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.370
 we remove the trauma love would take it away 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:00.180
 we hope that the others quite less 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:02.729
 have left I'm going to put 1 and 2 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.939
 move a maximum of three zones performed 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.939
 an attack 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.750
 one two three four four open and that 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.680
 there is 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.710
 nothing nothing 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.840
 I like it 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.880
 general event discards a counter 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.129
 ammunition of one of your anglia cards 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.789
 Chinese 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.710
 the cast and then removed 17 then 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.540
 Remove from the map 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.010
 and all markets are needed there is no 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.210
 none the continuation tested a new 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.880
 artificial intelligence face 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.919
 I do not like on each side nature every 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.919
 infamous the little ones if there is a region 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:46.009
 with four health or less I have 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.000
 three shots and three moves or less 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.280
 one 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.960
 is behind good I think this is over 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.780
 die 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.160
 there's no that's not the way the infamous moves two 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.449
 zones towards the figure of the region more 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.449
 nearby that is not covered 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.729
 if there are no game forms 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.979
 ready and the first turn is over 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.990
 up to here the game for today and first 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.879
 video first blender I do not know if 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.680
 you will not have noticed it when my character 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.509
 marcus fenix has become the first 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.219
 attack with the chainsaw for its 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:21.710
 special ability should throw five 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:24.110
 dice not four but what left 18 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.400
 I decided to throw 4 do not forget the 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.969
 fifth side but good luckily 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:32.569
 you have seen that it had not been necessary 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:34.909
 in fact it is a very useful skill and that 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.800
 it will make us notice quite a game with this 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.180
 of the front chain saw then we 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.740
 you put way after the 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.740
 heading thanks for your time
