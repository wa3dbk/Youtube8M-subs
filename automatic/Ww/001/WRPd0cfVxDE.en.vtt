00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.569 
it's so tough to say everybody has such
like<00:03:00.510> ah<00:03:01.940> man<00:03:03.920> yeah<00:03:04.920> i<00:03:04.950> think<00:03:05.129> we're<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
go with a D on right here as our number

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.630 
go with a D on right here as our number
one<00:03:11.239> then<00:03:12.239> right<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.959> believe<00:03:13.400> do<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.489> keep

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
one then right here I believe do we keep

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.409 
one then right here I believe do we keep
Woodson<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:16.430> think<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.549> keep<00:03:17.730> what's<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.150> there

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
Woodson I think we keep what's in there

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:23.170 
Woodson I think we keep what's in there
and<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.859> think<00:03:20.359> Sherman<00:03:21.359> becomes<00:03:21.870> our<00:03:22.019> force

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
and I think Sherman becomes our force

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.280 
and I think Sherman becomes our force
let's<00:03:24.180> see<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.359> can<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:24.630> Sherman<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.139> our

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
let's see we can for Sherman as our

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.039 
let's see we can for Sherman as our
force<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:29.459> tough<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.269> know<00:03:30.510> who<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.870> put

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
force it's tough to know who to put

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.979 
force it's tough to know who to put
we're<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.739> my<00:03:31.950> opinion<00:03:32.569> number<00:03:33.569> five<00:03:33.780> we're
