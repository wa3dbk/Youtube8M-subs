00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
everything game the hard soft games

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
everything game the hard soft games
released<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.560> pretend<00:00:17.010> something<00:00:17.369> series<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
released a pretend something series and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.689 
released a pretend something series and
there<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.619> games<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
there are a lot of games here and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
there are a lot of games here and
they're<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.390> having<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:22.050> much<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> same

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
they're all having pretty much the same

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.859 
they're all having pretty much the same
goal<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.670> gonna<00:00:23.820> show<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.150> pretend<00:00:24.660> gas

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
goal so I'm gonna show you pretend gas

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
goal so I'm gonna show you pretend gas
station<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.529> cuz<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> already<00:00:26.699> have

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
station just cuz you know I already have

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.200 
station just cuz you know I already have
a<00:00:26.880> game<00:00:27.180> saved<00:00:27.920> pretty<00:00:28.920> much<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.490> goal<00:00:29.939> most

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
a game saved pretty much our goal most

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.420 
a game saved pretty much our goal most
of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.380> build<00:00:31.679> some<00:00:31.859> roads<00:00:32.130> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of the time is to build some roads and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
of the time is to build some roads and
power<00:00:32.759> lines<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.780> mostly<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.649> can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
power lines and that's mostly all we can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370 
power lines and that's mostly all we can
do<00:00:35.010> other<00:00:35.850> games<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:37.050> things<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
do other games have different things you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.319 
do other games have different things you
can<00:00:37.469> pretend<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.280> hopefully<00:00:38.879> they'll

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can pretend and hopefully they'll

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
can pretend and hopefully they'll
eventually<00:00:39.570> perfect<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> multiplayer<00:00:40.829> so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
eventually perfect the multiplayer so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
eventually perfect the multiplayer so
you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> coordinate<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.480> friends<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you can coordinate with your friends and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.010 
you can coordinate with your friends and
make<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> functioning<00:00:44.219> pretend<00:00:44.640> city<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.690> for

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
make a functioning pretend city but for

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.190 
make a functioning pretend city but for
right<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> gas<00:00:46.950> station<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.329> yeah

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
right now or a gas station so yeah

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
right now or a gas station so yeah
earlier<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.370> game<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
earlier in this game there was an

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
earlier in this game there was an
earthquake<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> our<00:00:52.770> powerlines

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
earthquake and one of our powerlines

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
earthquake and one of our powerlines
went<00:00:53.550> down<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.300> should<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.570> our<00:00:54.690> first

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
went down so that should be our first

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
went down so that should be our first
priority<00:00:55.460> also<00:00:56.460> we're<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> middle<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
priority also we're in the middle of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
priority also we're in the middle of
building<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> connection<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> gas

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
building a connection from the gas

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
building a connection from the gas
station<00:00:59.000> to<00:01:00.000> our<00:01:00.210> phone<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.739> hopefully<00:01:01.739> I'll

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
station to our phone and hopefully I'll

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
station to our phone and hopefully I'll
show<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> today<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.510> yeah<00:01:03.870> let's<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
work and we're gonna walk because we

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.149 
work and we're gonna walk because we
don't<00:01:07.200> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> drive<00:01:07.619> where<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.010> no

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
don't want to drive where there's no

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.969 
don't want to drive where there's no
road<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.210> cause<00:01:09.420> an<00:01:09.600> earthquake

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
road or we might cause an earthquake

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
road or we might cause an earthquake
also<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.070> can't<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.400> spare<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> gas<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
also we can't really spare the gas so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.140 
also we can't really spare the gas so
let's<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.290> speed<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.310> fast<00:01:14.640> time

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
let's just speed up time too fast time

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
let's just speed up time too fast time
mode<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.869> hit<00:01:16.500> any<00:01:16.770> key<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> wanted<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
mode and hit any key when you wanted to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.300 
mode and hit any key when you wanted to
go<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> normal<00:01:18.299> town

and okay I'll open up shop and we
actually<00:01:24.369> already<00:01:24.580> have<00:01:24.729> enough<00:01:24.940> money<00:01:25.119> to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
actually already have enough money to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually already have enough money to
build<00:01:25.600> some<00:01:25.780> power<00:01:25.990> lines<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.380> let's<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.890> that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
build some power lines so let's do that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.280 
build some power lines so let's do that
I<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:28.000> click<00:01:28.150> on<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.479> power<00:01:28.690> line<00:01:28.930> button

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
I just click on the power line button

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.010 
I just click on the power line button
and<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:30.700> sure<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.000> select<00:01:31.150> be<00:01:31.450> extra<00:01:31.810> careful

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and make sure to select be extra careful

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.600 
and make sure to select be extra careful

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
you know we don't want to cause another

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.560 
you know we don't want to cause another
earthquake<00:01:34.830> yeah<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.190> there<00:01:36.880> now<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.150> need

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
earthquake yeah so there now we need

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.149 
earthquake yeah so there now we need
some<00:01:37.780> more<00:01:37.899> money<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.440> road

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
some more money for the road

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.790 
some more money for the road

so let's get to selling gas this road

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.330 
so let's get to selling gas this road
really<00:01:42.190> isn't<00:01:42.369> used<00:01:43.270> much<00:01:43.390> ever<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:45.190> let's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
gas so we're just gonna speed up time

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.699 
gas so we're just gonna speed up time
again<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> know<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.440> not<00:02:35.530> all
