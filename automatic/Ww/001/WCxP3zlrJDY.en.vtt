00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
specific location downloading that's

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.780 
specific location downloading that's
actually<00:01:32.230> a<00:01:32.260> heavily<00:01:32.680> customized<00:01:33.190> UI<00:01:33.490> that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
actually a heavily customized UI that

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.940 
actually a heavily customized UI that
you<00:01:33.940> use<00:01:34.150> yes<00:01:34.390> yes<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.200> now<00:01:35.440> we've<00:01:35.680> tried<00:01:35.920> to

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
you use yes yes so now we've tried to

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.560 
you use yes yes so now we've tried to
know<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.640> number<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.030> things<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.420> really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
know to number of things that really

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.030 
know to number of things that really
differentiate<00:01:38.080> ourselves<00:01:38.470> from<00:01:38.830> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
differentiate ourselves from the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.120 
differentiate ourselves from the
competitors<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.240> we've<00:01:40.930> done<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.440> UI<00:01:41.710> here

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
competitors so we've done a UI here
