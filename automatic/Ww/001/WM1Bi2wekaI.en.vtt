00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.429
 we are a supermarket and we have to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 choose a valid food 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.370
 alternative for our breakfast 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 breakfast is the most important meal 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 of the day able to provide us 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.869
 energy and nutrients useful for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.570
 allow us work activities 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 There is no doubt that breakfast is the meal 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 most important must never be 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 skipped there is no equal breakfast 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 for all there are those who prefer it savory 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 who is sweet the important thing and not to skip it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.300
 never take it slow and take it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.510
 especially a good portion of fruit 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 fresh in any case who does not want 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.079
 give up the sweet taste of cookies 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
 for breakfast 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.469
 the food industry offers us 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 multiple alternatives 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 many of which however should be 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 eliminated from the shelves of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.270
 supermarkets 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.210
 however we can find biscuits 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 from numerous flours 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 cereal so we have the flour of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.260
 kamut oat spelled from barley grain 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.580
 so we have lots of products from 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 this view is the choice in 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 this case can be given 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.170
 mainly from taste or from 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 presence of any pathologies 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.270
 however when we find ourselves of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 face a wide range of products 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.150
 for breakfast we have to direct the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.250
 our choices on dry biscuits 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 paying close attention to the list 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.640
 of ingredients remembering how 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.040
 always that those that appear for 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 the first are those most 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 represented within the product 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 in terms of quantity and therefore we must 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600
 pay close attention to the flour that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 is used for directing i 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.119
 products made from wholemeal flour 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.159
 here too it is important to remember and do 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 a premise or rather that the terms 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.180
 multigrain present on the label not 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.160
 always represent a product 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.690
 entirely integral very often they are 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.940
 simply of the flours obtained from 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.360
 different cereals that are mixed 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 between them or we can still find gods 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.800
 products enriched in fibers and in this 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.700
 In case we actually have a mixture of 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.679
 refined flour and bran or flour 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.510
 integral here in any case it is always 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.160
 a preferred product should be preferred 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 exclusively from whole wheat flour a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170
 regardless of the cereal we still have to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.220
 pay attention to the fats found 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.840
 inside of 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.380
 therefore be wary of buying 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.820
 products that are 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.560
 obtained with oil and hydrogenated fats 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.080
 or with 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.610
 palm oil rapeseed oil but for of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.730
 surely win those containing 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.200
 the extra virgin olive oil itself 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.489
 the same goes for sugars 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.230
 avoid buying products that 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.520
 contain refined sugars and 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.000
 prefer instead those containing 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.970
 missed maize pride rice malt 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.519
 syrup vegetable syrups sweetener 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.989
 natural so all those sweeteners 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.720
 that do not bring substances that 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.400
 can harm our health 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.300
 we must also remember that i 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 cookies do not have a low low 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.989
 caloric value 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 for this reason it is important to go to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.600
 moderate the quantity and therefore the consumption 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.980
 if you make a very rich breakfast in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.260
 biscuits obviously also in this case 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.780
 the quantity must be important and well 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.280
 considered snacks can be 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.200
 quietly made with fruit 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.569
 fresh in the market we can find 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.459
 also some cookies some products 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.750
 which are defined as light beware 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.160
 from the purchase of this type of products 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.830
 because they are products they have 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.320
 immediately a transformation process 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.209
 or a part of it was taken away 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.160
 fat and clear than to be able to make 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.730
 this palatable this product is a 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 enrichment in sugars or a 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.130
 enrichment of synthetic additives 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.720
 therefore it would be preferable to avoid 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.950
 this type of product is simply 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.140
 moderate the quantity of the classics 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.299
 dry biscuits available on the market 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.010
 find lots of good alternatives 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.750
 a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.150
 among those we have selected 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.680
 contains extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.549
 natural syrups and is made with flour 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.549
 of kamut
