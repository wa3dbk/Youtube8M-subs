this is so cool how does it even turn

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
this is so cool how does it even turn
what<00:00:44.970> wait<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:47.800> these<00:00:48.370> things<00:00:48.400> can<00:00:49.059> turn<00:00:49.360> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
what wait what these things can turn to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510 
what wait what these things can turn to
that's<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.489> cool<00:00:51.850> hey<00:00:52.570> guys<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.129> it's<00:00:54.430> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900 
online what cheater whoa are you like a
Rubik's<00:03:05.280> Cube<00:03:05.790> Master<00:03:06.750> Owen<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.640> got<00:03:08.880> all

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
Rubik's Cube Master Owen you got all

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.520 
Rubik's Cube Master Owen you got all
these<00:03:09.180> four<00:03:09.600> pieces<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> row<00:03:12.020> man<00:03:13.020> there's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
these four pieces in a row man there's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.300 
these four pieces in a row man there's
so<00:03:13.830> many<00:03:13.980> colors<00:03:15.650> whoa<00:03:18.560> how<00:03:19.560> does<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.070> even

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
so many colors whoa how does this even

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:30.110 
so many colors whoa how does this even
turn<00:03:21.270> oh<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:26.010> turned<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:28.520> then<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.640> doesn't<00:03:29.820> turn

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
turn oh I turned it then it doesn't turn

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.949 
turn oh I turned it then it doesn't turn
like<00:03:31.670> that's<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.150> weird<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:35.240> mean<00:03:36.240> how<00:03:36.900> would

you solve this what the heck whoa is
that<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.880> Rubik's<00:03:42.450> Cube<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.080> bet<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.830> can't

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
that a Rubik's Cube I bet you can't

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.710 
that a Rubik's Cube I bet you can't
solve<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.760> nobody<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.750> solve<00:03:46.050> Rubik's<00:03:46.500> Cube

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
solve it nobody can solve Rubik's Cube

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.940 
solve it nobody can solve Rubik's Cube
except<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.870> my<00:03:48.959> friend<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:49.740> like

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
except for my friend we do it in like

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.420 
except for my friend we do it in like
three<00:03:50.250> seconds<00:03:50.700> oh<00:03:50.990> yeah<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.980> solve<00:03:53.250> it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
three seconds oh yeah I can solve it

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:14.770 
three seconds oh yeah I can solve it
watch<00:03:54.150> this
