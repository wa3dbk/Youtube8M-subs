head<00:01:44.670> over<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> where<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
head over to there so this is where it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.240

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
as so and this will happen and it'll

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.740 
as so and this will happen and it'll
create<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.590> wormhole<00:01:49.890> type<00:01:50.280> thing

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
create this little wormhole type thing

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
create this little wormhole type thing
so<00:01:51.750> once<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> done<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.350> jump<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.770> BAM

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
back at the beginning again and then in

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.359 
back at the beginning again and then in
a<00:01:57.329> second<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.079> seems<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> seems<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> thing

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
a second it seems it seems to be a thing

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.100 
a second it seems it seems to be a thing
with<00:01:59.640> popping<00:02:00.119> achievements<00:02:00.600> later<00:02:00.780> me
