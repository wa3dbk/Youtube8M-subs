best for me and sentience you can't go
wrong<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.489> arma<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> pretty

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
wrong with them and my arma is pretty
cheap<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.320> awesome<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
cheap and really awesome so that's how I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
cheap and really awesome so that's how I
did<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.690> fast<00:00:49.140> kills<00:00:49.410> I'd

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
did it and it was pretty fast kills I'd

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
did it and it was pretty fast kills I'd
say<00:00:49.829> roughly<00:00:50.250> 50<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> 60<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.360> hour<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
say roughly 50 to 60 an hour so that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
say roughly 50 to 60 an hour so that
means<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.590> around<00:00:52.829> 9<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:53.820> 8<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.329> 10<00:00:54.480> hours

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
means it was around 9 or 8 to 10 hours

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
means it was around 9 or 8 to 10 hours
or<00:00:54.899> something<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.710> let's<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.309> say

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
or something like that so let's just say

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
or something like that so let's just say
it's<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> low<00:00:56.940> end<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> took<00:00:57.629> 10<00:00:57.989> hours<00:00:58.020> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it's the low end and it took 10 hours so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.380 
it's the low end and it took 10 hours so
you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> hourly<00:00:59.460> cash<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.120> get

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.649 
but they do add up if you're going to do
kbd<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.740> money<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.240> honest<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
kbd for money but to be honest I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
kbd for money but to be honest I
wouldn't<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.290> you'll<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:28.950> at

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
wouldn't well you'll just have to see at

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.109 
wouldn't well you'll just have to see at
the<00:01:29.130> end<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> price<00:01:29.520> check<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> this

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the end of the price check if this

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
the end of the price check if this
hourly<00:01:31.079> rate<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> fine<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.250> also

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
hourly rate is fine for you you also

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
hourly rate is fine for you you also
have<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> consider<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.299> am<00:01:33.450> maxed<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
have to consider that I am maxed and I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
have to consider that I am maxed and I
kill<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> max<00:01:35.490> efficiency<00:01:36.030> usually<00:01:36.390> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
kill at a max efficiency usually so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
kill at a max efficiency usually so
let's<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.900> into<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> rare<00:01:37.350> drops<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> got

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
let's go into the rare drops that I got

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.069 
let's go into the rare drops that I got
so<00:01:38.400> first<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.880> did<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> rare<00:01:39.509> drop<00:01:39.780> table

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so first up I did get a rare drop table

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
so first up I did get a rare drop table
drop<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.619> 150<00:01:41.280> onyx<00:01:41.579> bolts<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.240> weird

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
drop which was 150 onyx bolts the weird

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
drop which was 150 onyx bolts the weird
thing<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> thought<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.259> onyx<00:01:43.799> bolt<00:01:44.009> drops

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
thing is I thought the onyx bolt drops

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
thing is I thought the onyx bolt drops
was<00:01:44.610> enchanted<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> guess<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> rare<00:01:46.049> drop

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
was enchanted but I guess the rare drop

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
was enchanted but I guess the rare drop
table<00:01:46.560> ones<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.280> enchanted<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
table ones are not enchanted and then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.700 
table ones are not enchanted and then
the<00:01:48.390> ones<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.720> from<00:01:48.780> Corp<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> necks<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the ones you get from Corp and necks and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
the ones you get from Corp and necks and
whatnot<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> cool<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
whatnot are so that's kind of cool I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.359 
whatnot are so that's kind of cool I
didn't<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.320> mess<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.829> tabs<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.220> anything

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
didn't like mess up my tabs or anything

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510 
didn't like mess up my tabs or anything
so<00:01:53.869> 150<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.079> roughly<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.500> 1.2<00:01:56.040> mil<00:01:56.219> for

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
so 150 that's roughly like 1.2 mil for

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
so 150 that's roughly like 1.2 mil for
just<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> rare<00:01:57.000> drop<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.719> nice<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
just a rare drop that's really nice and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
just a rare drop that's really nice and
then<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> follow<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.460> rare<00:01:59.610> drop<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
then to follow up that rare drop I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
then to follow up that rare drop I
actually<00:02:00.119> did<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> dragon<00:02:00.960> riders<00:02:01.350> glove

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
actually did get a dragon riders glove

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
actually did get a dragon riders glove
which<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.670> items<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.000> you're

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180

searching for here are the gloves and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.280 
searching for here are the gloves and
the<00:02:05.310> boots<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.759> they're<00:02:06.030> roughly<00:02:06.329> 2<00:02:07.079> mil

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the boots because they're roughly 2 mil

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
the boots because they're roughly 2 mil
or<00:02:07.530> something<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.129> mean<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> visit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
or something like that I mean the visit

or something like that I mean the visit
is<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.569> good<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.929> well<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.259> 1.2<00:02:10.739> mil<00:02:10.920> but

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
is really good as well it's 1.2 mil but

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.369 
is really good as well it's 1.2 mil but
it's<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.580> rare<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.720> shouldn't<00:02:12.959> even<00:02:13.110> go

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
it's so rare that you shouldn't even go

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's so rare that you shouldn't even go
for

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.199 
for
worked<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:15.120> get

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
worked and then you also can get

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330 
worked and then you also can get
ornament<00:02:15.690> kits<00:02:15.870> which<00:02:16.050> are<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.379> 40k<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.280> I'm

ornament kits which are like 40k so I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.979 
ornament kits which are like 40k so I'm
glad<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.580> didn't<00:02:17.879> get<00:02:18.030> any<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.390> then<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.810> for

glad I didn't get any and then as for

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.080 
glad I didn't get any and then as for
other<00:02:19.140> air<00:02:19.319> drops<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.739> did<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.069> six<00:02:20.400> KBD<00:02:20.849> heads

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
other air drops I did get six KBD heads

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.580 
other air drops I did get six KBD heads
which<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.360> thought<00:02:21.540> was<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.840> little

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
which I thought was a little little

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.830 
which I thought was a little little
extreme<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.220> lked<00:02:23.640> them<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.269> were<00:02:24.330> 30<00:02:24.660> K

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
extreme I lked them and they were 30 K

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.500 
extreme I lked them and they were 30 K
each<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> mean<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:25.830> an<00:02:25.920> extra<00:02:26.190> 180<00:02:27.090> K<00:02:27.360> or

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
each so I mean that's an extra 180 K or

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.449 
each so I mean that's an extra 180 K or
something<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.050> yeah<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.590> too<00:02:28.739> bad<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.340> yeah

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
something so yeah not too bad so yeah

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.740 
something so yeah not too bad so yeah
that<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.760> pretty<00:02:29.940> much<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> drops<00:02:30.599> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that was pretty much all the drops I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.970 
that was pretty much all the drops I
mean<00:02:30.870> there's<00:02:31.019> really<00:02:31.200> nothing<00:02:31.530> else<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
mean there's really nothing else it's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500 
mean there's really nothing else it's
just<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.220> lot<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.370> stackables<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.120> notables

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just a lot of stackables and notables

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
just a lot of stackables and notables
and<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:34.260> banked<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> bones<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> hides

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and I banked all the bones and the hides

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.150 
and I banked all the bones and the hides
and<00:02:35.819> whatnot<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.840> did<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.470> hopping<00:02:37.830> methods

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
and whatnot I did do the hopping methods

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.589 
and whatnot I did do the hopping methods
so<00:02:38.340> every<00:02:38.610> time<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> got<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> kill<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.239> would<00:02:39.450> hop

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
so every time I got a kill I would hop

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.650

mil<00:05:45.340> from<00:05:45.490> just<00:05:45.759> this<00:05:45.910> loop<00:05:46.120> video<00:05:46.360> I'm

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
mil from just this loop video I'm

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.200 
mil from just this loop video I'm
extremely<00:05:47.259> excited<00:05:47.740> about<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:49.090> is

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
extremely excited about that that is

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.330 
extremely excited about that that is
good<00:05:49.389> money<00:05:49.569> for<00:05:49.990> my<00:05:50.259> supplies<00:05:50.889> and<00:05:51.099> whatnot<00:05:51.310> I

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
good money for my supplies and whatnot I

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.719 
good money for my supplies and whatnot I
got<00:05:51.669> a<00:05:51.699> stock<00:05:52.240> up<00:05:52.389> again<00:05:52.660> and<00:05:52.889> I<00:05:53.889> did<00:05:54.370> let's<00:05:54.610> say

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
got a stock up again and I did let's say

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.670 
got a stock up again and I did let's say
ten<00:05:55.000> hours<00:05:55.479> but<00:05:55.720> it<00:05:55.840> okay<00:05:56.229> I<00:05:56.259> could<00:05:56.530> probably

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
ten hours but it okay I could probably

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.960 
ten hours but it okay I could probably
do<00:05:56.830> it<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:56.949> eight<00:05:57.130> hours<00:05:57.280> seven<00:05:57.669> into<00:05:57.849> eight

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
do it in eight hours seven into eight

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.909 
do it in eight hours seven into eight
hours<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:58.930> I<00:05:58.960> mean<00:05:59.169> that's<00:05:59.289> a<00:05:59.380> little<00:05:59.500> bit<00:05:59.740> more

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
hours so I mean that's a little bit more

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.879 
hours so I mean that's a little bit more
than<00:06:00.780> 2-million<00:06:01.780> hour<00:06:01.960> but<00:06:02.319> let's<00:06:02.650> just<00:06:02.800> say

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
than 2-million hour but let's just say

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.010 
than 2-million hour but let's just say
it's<00:06:03.039> about<00:06:03.190> two<00:06:03.400> million<00:06:03.610> our<00:06:03.729> KVD<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.479> that

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
it's about two million our KVD and that

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.350 
it's about two million our KVD and that
is<00:06:05.169> with<00:06:05.319> a<00:06:05.349> little<00:06:05.530> bit<00:06:05.740> look<00:06:05.919> I<00:06:06.130> guess<00:06:06.340> so

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
is with a little bit look I guess so

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.089 
is with a little bit look I guess so
KBD<00:06:07.780> isn't<00:06:08.169> really<00:06:08.380> that<00:06:08.410> bad<00:06:08.680> I<00:06:08.740> mean<00:06:08.949> I

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
KBD isn't really that bad I mean I

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.650 
KBD isn't really that bad I mean I
thought<00:06:09.310> it<00:06:09.400> was<00:06:09.520> going<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.699> be<00:06:09.759> like<00:06:09.849> 1.2<00:06:10.509> mil

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
thought it was going to be like 1.2 mil

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.140 
thought it was going to be like 1.2 mil
an<00:06:10.780> hour<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:11.530> really<00:06:11.560> isn't<00:06:11.889> it's<00:06:12.160> 20<00:06:12.819> parrots

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
an hour it really isn't it's 20 parrots

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.240 
an hour it really isn't it's 20 parrots
2<00:06:13.330> mil<00:06:13.479> an<00:06:13.569> hour<00:06:13.659> usually<00:06:14.110> so<00:06:14.319> it's<00:06:14.979> really

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
2 mil an hour usually so it's really

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.620 
2 mil an hour usually so it's really
cool<00:06:15.490> I'm<00:06:15.819> happy<00:06:16.180> about<00:06:16.270> that

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630
