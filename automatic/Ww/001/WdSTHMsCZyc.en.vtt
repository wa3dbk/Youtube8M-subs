00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
bit increase the difficulty just by a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
bit increase the difficulty just by a
little<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> marginal<00:01:24.509> amount<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.869> i'll

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
little in by a marginal amount and i'll

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
little in by a marginal amount and i'll
be<00:01:25.080> dog<00:01:25.320> yeah<00:01:25.830> Riley<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.549> i<00:01:26.700> knew<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> i

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
be dog yeah Riley can i knew that i

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
be dog yeah Riley can i knew that i
don't<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.330> i'll<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.570> using<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
don't think i'll be using this when the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.319 
don't think i'll be using this when the
game<00:01:28.890> comes<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.189> i<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.340> he'll<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
game comes out i think he'll be more of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.030 
game comes out i think he'll be more of
a<00:01:30.390> new<00:01:30.600> mystery<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> people<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.950> know

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
a new mystery the people use you know

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
a new mystery the people use you know
I'm<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> less<00:01:33.240> skilled

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I'm kind of like the less skilled

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
I'm kind of like the less skilled
players<00:01:33.810> kinda<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> credit<00:01:34.619> missile

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
players kinda like the credit missile

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
players kinda like the credit missile
equivalent<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.759> gets<00:01:36.030> maybe<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.600> two

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
equivalent it gets maybe one or two

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
equivalent it gets maybe one or two
kills<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.170> felt<00:01:37.409> lucky<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:38.280> if

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
kills if felt lucky if you know if

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.890 
kills if felt lucky if you know if
you're<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.729> lucky<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you're really lucky with it so it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
you're really lucky with it so it's
generally<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.350> something<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.250> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
generally not something that people go

unless they just want to be a nuisance
for<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.810> whenever<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.320> got<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
for a bit and whenever I got it in the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
for a bit and whenever I got it in the
game<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> tried<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> once<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> then

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
game I think I tried it once and then

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.370 
game I think I tried it once and then
after<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.630> whenever<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.350> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
after that whenever I got it I just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
after that whenever I got it I just
threw<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> floor<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.219> left<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
threw on the floor and left it and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
threw on the floor and left it and
because<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.840> pretty<00:02:00.990> useful<00:02:01.320> useless

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
because it was pretty useful useless

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
because it was pretty useful useless

incall doing girls now you go to see I'm
playing<00:02:10.080> domination<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.890> game<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.400> said

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
playing domination this game like I said

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.770 
playing domination this game like I said
and<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> change

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and what the change

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960 
and what the change
should<00:02:14.110> ecology<00:02:14.530> Eagles<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.160> they<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.730> not

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
should ecology Eagles is I they do not

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
should ecology Eagles is I they do not
have<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.209> around<00:02:16.720> split<00:02:17.050> like<00:02:17.200> they<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.470> in

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
have the around split like they do in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.660 
have the around split like they do in
black<00:02:17.740> ops<00:02:17.890> 2<00:02:17.980> because<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.310> really<00:02:18.459> does

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
black ops 2 because that really does

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.949 
black ops 2 because that really does
kill<00:02:18.940> momentum<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:19.569> glad<00:02:19.810> they've

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
kill momentum so I'm glad they've

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.420 
kill momentum so I'm glad they've
changed<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> back<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> old<00:02:20.830> way<00:02:21.010> with<00:02:21.220> just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
changed it back to the old way with just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.090 
changed it back to the old way with just
a<00:02:21.520> full<00:02:21.700> game<00:02:21.880> what<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.720> done<00:02:22.750> in

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
a full game what they have done in

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.199 
a full game what they have done in
