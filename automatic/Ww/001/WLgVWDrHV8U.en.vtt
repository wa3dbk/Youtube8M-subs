00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.360
 Tomorrow I am the stamp is coming 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.040
 to a new weapons, we are indeed to it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 the last of biocel was a bit 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 but it continues and that it was 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.619
 a ptbs means this is available to all 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.750
 makes it free from rank 45 so until 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.650
 towards the moderate church ranked fifth 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 45 goes the damage relatively quickly 20 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.150
 up 18.4 it is until something else there 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 The power means 20 damage in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.930
 melee she needs five goals in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 melee and then from then always six 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 then drop balls until the death of the opponent 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.890
 off start at six men so off 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 six meters always needed six balls 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.379
 and the drop to about 40 meters thick 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.149
 Capacity is 20 and a shot is something 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.940
 less but there is in the magazine 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.010
 Extending the firing rate 90 bullets per 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 minute and that sounds quite different 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 nice 90 balls that's already on top 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.739
 not with the best glass 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.809
 But the farmer is very high up with 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 in any case, cow's speed 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.840
 is a little less 333 meters per second 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 and the reach with it 66 65 meters the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 is because that is a pw is here 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.700
 mostly or mostly 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 a little lower speed and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.340
 fighting for Schalke is that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.159
 comprehensibly 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.040
 after a long time 17 seconds and if 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.900
 she is empty if she does not 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 completely empty it 1.7 seconds 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.140
 it's really fast and he always has 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.790
 a whole second faster than if 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.799
 she completely made it what it means 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 a bullet before reloading 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 that saves you a whole second 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.710
 and that decides on victory and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 defeat is also determined by that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.400
 opponent dies the scatter in visor 0,0 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.070
 That does not mean that every ball is perfect 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.450
 only the first shot of the one hits 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.890
 paragraph will always hit that is if 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.420
 you once shoot the us cult meets in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.990
 Inter perfectly exactly where do you go to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.079
 can you even see it like that but then it is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 it the other in movement but by 15 and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.619
 that's an incredible forgiveness 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.409
 means as soon as you have moved you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.299
 a much higher spill, then 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.009
 whole piece higher it even messes up 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 would so if you move 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.390
 sometimes they do too 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.039
 hard but the senses it is with you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.300
 the best in the choice of a doctor 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.530
 stand two if you shoot 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.700
 from the hip 25 20 and 15 if you can 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.850
 stands and you move 30 25 and 20 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.530
 that is actually okay even 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.760
 that the exact same values as at 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100
 granted a storm and should here 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.210
 it just seems that means here 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.280
 the switch does not make that happen 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.020
 it is clear that it is worse 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.100
 even traffic accident but even better 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.640
 but it is not worse than that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.180
 storm rifles so fits still fits 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.100
 recoil 04 up that's it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.680
 bad that can be really good 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.920
 then go left 0.2 and to the right 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.150
 03 that's okay you can 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.890
 bit to a bit to the left 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.680
 down do not pull so hard 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.330
 cool, but the good control 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.100
 what's even better is you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.020
 multiply the 05 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.360
 that means the first shot is the 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.740
 weapon even less recoil than if 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.000
 your continuous fire so the other ball 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.830
 after that comes the grant even has 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.380
 less recoil normal the auditory and 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.810
 now even lower that is, it does 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.260
 the minibars so which is very small 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.870
 four shots 53 m resort quite small 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.850
 mini burst took advantage of their first 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 Precision out in sight and you have 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.480
 this multiply several times because he 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.150
 always make sure he does something 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040
 So there is less recoil you can do 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.680
 use weapon with the minibus really cool 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 Definitely a summary so 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.580
 the first shock is a scatter 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.540
 then it is permanently soundproofed that 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.640
 you will not be on the mini map 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.800
 displayed when you shoot you have one 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.270
 something else has damage model so 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.280
 five balls in close combat and then allowed 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.680
 six balls so until the death of 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.780
 opponent or hits energies want 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.260
 then he has his rescue after a long time 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.920
 So 17 fc nitra complain and unfortunately 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.230
 without further magazine only 20 shot now 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.850
 is the set of the time 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.130
 worth mentioning I do not think so 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.110
 bad but already a little higher 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.760
 distance is the ironside turn something 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.230
 Annoying , I would be so many now 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.720
 points awarded but not too little 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.880
 so you can use it in any case 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.350
 Remove the reflex sale something 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.209
 better because the point he always helps 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.620
 A little bit with the weapons in general 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.570
 where the inference is easy to control 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.940
 is the reflex always too 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.229
 recommend in any case so reflex is 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.970
 not necessarily worse than that 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.050
 cobras is on here because I like the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.530
 coupe what do you mean 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.840
 So it's not necessarily so bad 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.569
 be the cobra against it big field of vision 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.729
 stop this all rounder visier what you 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.789
 can use everywhere at all distances 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.440
 the cobra already recommended otherwise 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.330
 which still mention the solo time 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.490
 not really holos anymore 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.960
 time you also know for distance i 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.669
 I used it once I have mine 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.620
 photos have you played on a 2 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.270
 now done away because the recoil after 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.250
 above is again that can be a harmless 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.690
 really annoying and besides 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.550
 I like this circle and the point 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.680
 not so much for that reason the cobra or 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.069
 reflex could not do much wrong 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.169
 do 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.360
 then you have another loan 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.849
 because the weapon village is driving and that 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.810
 keep stack sorry for the laser and the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.840
 A trade magazine 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.000
 the tech sorrow blinds the opponent is yes 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.360
 Ok you know but you only have 20 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.509
 shot laser is better but you have 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.759
 still 20 shot therefore magazine 30 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.139
 shot at more shot you can not 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.599
 complains fall in all it takes 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.460
 you do not necessarily but at the 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.259
 I would rather be teeth 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.240
 continue to grab the magazine and the tech sorry 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.690
 are left and the laser pointer mai 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.680
 to let 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.779
 just as a conclusion as an essay row 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.969
 I would say that cobra visier 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.020
 the expanded magazine and that 's it 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.620
 actually already more unfortunately for 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.229
 disposal 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.029
 and then you can actually pretty nice 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.800
 what rips a bit exercise the weapons 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.370
 The trend is, but then it is 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.199
 really bad 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.729
 yes I hope you liked it 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.940
 has skin on the next video 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.940
 today
