this product it i have to admit it does

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.850 
this product it i have to admit it does
look<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.400> little<00:04:06.730> bit<00:04:07.030> CGI'd<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.840> me<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.260> was<00:04:08.560> kind

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
look a little bit CGI'd to me I was kind

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.979 
look a little bit CGI'd to me I was kind
of<00:04:08.890> hoping<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.310> wouldn't<00:04:09.459> be<00:04:09.610> such<00:04:09.880> CGI<00:04:10.420> but

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
of hoping it wouldn't be such CGI but

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.220 
of hoping it wouldn't be such CGI but
least<00:04:11.500> we<00:04:12.190> have<00:04:12.400> actual<00:04:13.000> real<00:04:13.269> storm<00:04:13.810> trooper

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
least we have actual real storm trooper

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.080 
least we have actual real storm trooper
suits<00:04:14.590> instead<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.250> every<00:04:15.579> single<00:04:15.760> on<00:04:15.910> being

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
suits instead of every single on being

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.509 
suits instead of every single on being
see<00:04:16.239> dry<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.079> think<00:04:17.290> I<00:04:17.350> obviously<00:04:17.680> CGI<00:04:18.250> is

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
see dry but I think I obviously CGI is

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.440 
see dry but I think I obviously CGI is
necessary<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.519> obviously<00:04:21.640> tell<00:04:22.150> all

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
necessary but you can obviously tell all

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.310 
necessary but you can obviously tell all
the<00:04:22.690> props<00:04:22.930> are<00:04:23.200> built<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.880> looks<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.390> cool
