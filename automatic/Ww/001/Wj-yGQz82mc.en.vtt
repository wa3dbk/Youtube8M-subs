00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hi guys today I will show you 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.480
 how is the unlocking of the central 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.139
 ford fusion titanium 2014 multimedia is 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.230
 so you can see in the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.460
 multimedia screen is digital tv and dvd 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 basically for this you need 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 two components a component is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.920
 installed is behind the appliance by 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 inside the panel and another below 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.850
 that you are seeing that the reader is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 for dvd and a television set that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.670
 is composed of receptor of control 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 remote from the antenna and some other 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 components 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.140
 basically I'll show you 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 allows you to see is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 television right 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 What is more interesting without you? 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 lose steering wheel controls then 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.920
 I can change channels here. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.220
 This is very interesting, you can do it. 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.409
 maintaining the television channels is a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.369
 another interesting point here for 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.820
 toggle the dvd you hold okay tight 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.860
 he plays for dvd you do not lose any 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.860
 volume command 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.870
 Can you change lanes? 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.250
 You do not lose any command and it's for 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.479
 you lose the signal so that you 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.910
 cancel the signal 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:56.170
 just push the signal to change the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.869
 world is and when you push the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 changes and continues to pass but obviously 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.300
 if you have movement 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 it will block the signal unless 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:13.239
 you are in park position 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:17.440
 so when you change here drive it 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:21.310
 blocks the signal that unlocks 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.080
 will give you a warning that you will 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.340
 receive video teaching at position 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 So it 's ok, this is not personal. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.890
 impossible to unlock is a 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.590
 work is a job that does not 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.709
 It's simple to do, but whoever has 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.540
 willingness to have the media functionality 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.580
 He did not run away, he did not have to buy another one. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.400
 multimedia is just to buy these 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.600
 components 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.140
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.140
 hug
