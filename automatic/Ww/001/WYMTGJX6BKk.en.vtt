00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.750
 yes 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.150
 the workshop consisted in addressing some 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.419
 rhythms of our Colombian folklore of 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.240
 the Atlantic coast of the Pacific coast 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.160
 and examine a little the way of 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.160
 traditional touches on instruments 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.170
 autochthonous native and then ways 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 to pass it to the battery to be 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.670
 effective when playing let's say in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 a situation where we are as unique 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 percussionist or where we have another 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.430
 because one is next or two see the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.869
 different ways of playing these rhythms 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.320
 and understand a little where it comes from 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.320
 each 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.520
 there are different types of ducts 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.510
 different groupings equations 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.510
 again based on wood 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.860
 there is a long bagpipe 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.650
 now 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.170
 now they do not have 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.190
 movements what are clapping voices and 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.340
 percussions 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.340
 to this type of dances 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.680
 there are groups of women who also 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.390
 It depends on us 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.390
 receives the terrible name 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.590
 at the time of approaching this type of rhythms 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.420
 sometimes a little frustrating because 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.140
 we found that there is not much material is 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.789
 say there are not many records there are not many 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 material a lot written material though 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.060
 there are certain things and there are very elements 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.190
 valuable also to those of us who can 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.720
 remit to understand a little bit that came 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.870
 the most important thing is to listen is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.370
 to listen is to analyze a little bit is to have 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.840
 the opportunity to suddenly go to the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.220
 festivals that there is a quantity of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.180
 festivals in the Pacific in the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.670
 Atlantic 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 of all these rhythms is very important 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.390
 Well, also have as certain 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.480
 academic knowledge for example 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.769
 all the written part of the notes and that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.690
 it is fundamental then when it comes to 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.420
 understand well the rhythms power as 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.640
 group everything very well to understand and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.440
 can pass it to the battery and in that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.290
 way we meet many 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.970
 concepts many techniques that are going to 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.710
 help have more tools and more 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.660
 elements to do it from a 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.660
 responsible and clear way 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.290
 ah 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.579
 and we started playing the hype 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.579
 the place 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.180
 two 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.170
 if really this is a very passion 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.060
 great not only for the rhythms 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.950
 Colombian but the percussion 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.810
 battery in general is to say to me 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.870
 I really like this whole Latin story 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.110
 themes of traditional and indigenous music 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.640
 but I also play rock I play pop and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.680
 other amount of rhythms many rhythms 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.890
 Cubans too but it seems very 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.540
 important that we as Colombians 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.680
 we have that mission not everyone what 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.959
 has to do but it would be 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.209
 important that many of us are motivated 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.010
 to study these rhythms to go to 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.780
 festivals to start listening to this 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.700
 music because 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.739
 that's going to make a difference a bit in 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.630
 the world there are thousands of rock drummers 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.940
 thousands of jazz reggae artists from 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.490
 pop but one realizes that with these 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.560
 elements is like having a treasure there 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.630
 it is also other elements that are not going to 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.930
 open his mind and how 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.930
 make music 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.790
 do not
