know<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.489> maturity<00:02:51.970> seems<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.360> long

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
know it's a the maturity seems a long

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:07.690 
know it's a the maturity seems a long
way<00:02:52.630> off<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.290> my<00:02:53.530> god<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.070> got<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.220> big<00:02:54.400> nose

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.790 

well<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:08.270> would<00:03:08.660> say<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> sum<00:03:09.200> up<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
well I would say to sum up I think the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.190 
well I would say to sum up I think the
sideshow<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:11.300> probably<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.810> needed<00:03:11.990> a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
sideshow it probably just needed a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:22.520 
sideshow it probably just needed a
little<00:03:12.470> more<00:03:12.500> time<00:03:12.950> yeah<00:03:13.130> picture

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.940 

I<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:26.510> noticed<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.780> you've<00:03:28.020> been<00:03:28.260> swallowing

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
I I noticed that you've been swallowing

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.180 
I I noticed that you've been swallowing
and<00:03:29.730> at<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> wine<00:03:30.240> tasting<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:31.350> actually<00:03:31.770> spit

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and at a wine tasting you actually spit

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.979 
and at a wine tasting you actually spit
the<00:03:32.430> wine<00:03:32.580> out<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.000> don't<00:03:33.209> swallow<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:36.390> spit

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
the wine out you don't swallow so spit

00:03:38.989 --> 00:04:05.400 
the wine out you don't swallow so spit
spit<00:03:39.989> spit<00:03:42.980> into<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.220> nearest<00:03:44.400> empty<00:03:44.819> barrel

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.530 

there<00:04:06.410> is<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:06.950> much<00:04:07.190> bitterness<00:04:07.489> in<00:04:07.940> there<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
there is so much bitterness in there I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.420 
there is so much bitterness in there I
think<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.800> McDermott<00:04:10.099> coming<00:04:10.489> back<00:04:12.160> he's<00:04:13.160> not

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
think the McDermott coming back he's not

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.629 
think the McDermott coming back he's not
coming<00:04:13.790> back

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.240 

in<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.060> Sandman

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.310 

you
