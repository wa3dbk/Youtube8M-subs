00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
them as the teams have to try to figure

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.910 
them as the teams have to try to figure
out<00:01:52.150> how<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.360> retrieve<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.810> batons<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.410> then

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
out how to retrieve the batons and then

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.469 
out how to retrieve the batons and then
go<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.190> find<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.610> appropriate<00:01:54.850> rolling<00:01:55.330> goal

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
go and find the appropriate rolling goal

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.219 
go and find the appropriate rolling goal
and<00:01:55.570> tossed<00:01:55.840> them<00:01:55.990> into<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.869> really<00:01:59.080> is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
and tossed them into it it really is

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.990 
and tossed them into it it really is
about<00:01:59.470> getting<00:01:59.710> kids<00:02:00.040> exposed<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.640> science

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
about getting kids exposed to science

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.490 
about getting kids exposed to science
technology<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.630> engineering<00:02:01.900> in<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.410> way

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
technology and engineering in a way

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:24.740 
technology and engineering in a way
that's<00:02:02.710> fun
