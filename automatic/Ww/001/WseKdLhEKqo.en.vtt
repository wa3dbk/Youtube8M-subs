lucky and it's really a lot of skill

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.210 
lucky and it's really a lot of skill
involved<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.630> what<00:00:27.019> happens<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:27.589> I<00:00:27.800> go<00:00:27.949> in<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
involved so what happens is I go in the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.950 
involved so what happens is I go in the
first<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:28.699> didn't<00:00:29.060> show<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:29.329> whole<00:00:29.449> video<00:00:29.630> I'm

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
first I didn't show the whole video I'm

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.179 
first I didn't show the whole video I'm
not<00:00:30.109> showing<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.439> whole<00:00:30.619> video<00:00:30.769> because<00:00:31.070> it's

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
not showing the whole video because it's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.610 
not showing the whole video because it's
like<00:00:31.310> 11<00:00:31.759> minutes<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.329> it's<00:00:33.079> late<00:00:33.290> right<00:00:33.470> now

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
like 11 minutes and it's late right now

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.229 
like 11 minutes and it's late right now

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
it's like nine o'clock and I want to get

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.490 
it's like nine o'clock and I want to get
this<00:00:35.329> video<00:00:35.510> up<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.079> next<00:00:36.260> three<00:00:36.410> hours

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
this video up in the next three hours

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.189 
this video up in the next three hours
and<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.789> takes<00:00:37.969> two<00:00:38.149> hours<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.510> render<00:00:38.750> videos

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
and it takes two hours to render videos

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.080 
and it takes two hours to render videos
into<00:00:39.530> YouTube<00:00:39.829> format<00:00:40.219> because<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:40.910> 1080p

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
into YouTube format because it's 1080p

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.029 
into YouTube format because it's 1080p
and<00:00:41.510> these<00:00:41.629> files<00:00:41.870> are<00:00:41.989> really<00:00:42.170> big<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.500> it

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
and these files are really big and it

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.889 
and these files are really big and it
takes<00:00:43.190> me<00:00:43.340> another<00:00:43.489> two<00:00:43.699> hours<00:00:43.940> i<00:00:44.030> upload<00:00:44.359> so<00:00:44.660> i

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
takes me another two hours i upload so i

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.619 
takes me another two hours i upload so i
probably<00:00:45.289> can<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.800> up<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.039> like<00:00:46.190> 1am<00:00:46.629> well

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
probably can have it up to like 1am well

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.090 
probably can have it up to like 1am well
so<00:00:48.019> i'm<00:00:48.170> not<00:00:48.289> showing<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:48.620> whole<00:00:48.769> video<00:00:48.949> this

130 it's going to be harder and this is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.930 
130 it's going to be harder and this is
like<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> ladder<00:01:30.680> 8<00:01:30.980> this<00:01:31.070> map<00:01:31.280> one<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.550> ten<00:01:31.730> one

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
like a ladder 8 this map one to ten one

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.460 
like a ladder 8 this map one to ten one
being<00:01:31.970> easy<00:01:32.330> ten<00:01:32.660> being<00:01:32.810> hard<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:33.230> like<00:01:33.290> it

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
being easy ten being hard it's like it

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.540 
being easy ten being hard it's like it
like<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> six<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:36.020> hard<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:38.230> go<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.770> die

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
like a six so it's hard and I go I die

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.510 
like a six so it's hard and I go I die
again<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.530> my<00:01:42.530> friends<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:42.950> game<00:01:43.070> chat<00:01:43.250> making

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
seems like there's just not enough ammo

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.410 
seems like there's just not enough ammo
in<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> clip<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.730> even<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.090> extended

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
in the clip I even have extended

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.479 
in the clip I even have extended
magazine<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.799> was<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.129> it's<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.340> normal

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
magazine and I was like it's a normal

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.550 
magazine and I was like it's a normal
Club<00:04:09.909> and<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.690> bullets<00:04:11.049> seemed<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.409> as<00:04:11.530> a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
Club and the bullets seemed like as a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.069 
Club and the bullets seemed like as a
delay<00:04:11.950> between<00:04:12.489> when<00:04:13.030> each<00:04:13.329> bullet<00:04:13.659> comes<00:04:13.930> out

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
delay between when each bullet comes out

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.949 
delay between when each bullet comes out

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.129 
me a while to get them I mean it seems
like<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:18.910> seems<00:04:19.209> like<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.479> always<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.780> cold

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139

blooded<00:04:20.320> all<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.750> look<00:04:23.080> at<00:04:23.199> the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
blooded all of it and I you look at the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.080 
blooded all of it and I you look at the
charts<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.740> has<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.160> most<00:04:24.310> damage<00:04:24.639> but

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
charts and it has the most damage but

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.189 
charts and it has the most damage but
that<00:04:25.210> doesn't<00:04:25.270> matter<00:04:25.539> when<00:04:25.900> you're<00:04:26.020> dealing

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
that doesn't matter when you're dealing

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.350 
that doesn't matter when you're dealing
with<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> gun<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.710> takes<00:04:30.070> like<00:04:30.360> longer

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
with with a gun that takes like longer

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
to shoot between each Bowl it's

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.469 
to shoot between each Bowl it's
automatic<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.490> just<00:04:33.910> seems<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.360> takes

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479
