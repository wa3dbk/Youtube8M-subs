00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.590
 good but it's not me I'm a musician dj 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.460
 violinist 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.460
 producer 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:20.660
 you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:23.660
 it's called ingesting faces to yours divan 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.660
 very much 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.329
 tonight they are expecting a very good party 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.390
 they expected some progress for two with 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.470
 commercial premises let's see 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.470
 how is the night 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.130
 ah 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.509
 well I've been since I was 12 years old 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.610
 musician as dj I've been 3 years and like 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.830
 5 years old violinist, I like it 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.810
 experience more than anything and I can think of 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.490
 the idea of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.659
 experiment with electronic music 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.899
 some instrument something more different not 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.840
 so if the violin that I have right now is 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.130
 sink in electric and also good is the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380
 weight for my presentations but 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.299
 normally I use the good acoustic 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.939
 there is a lot of fact from the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.880
 sound from with the way is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.350
 relatively of the way of touching it is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.170
 same does not have the same mechanics the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.969
 same technique but the sound influences 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.599
 much the force that you put in the bow with 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.189
 the one with the strings includes a lot and therefore 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.759
 definitely the sound is not the same 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.909
 or that they follow their goals that do not 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.969
 discourage that yes 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.350
 if it gets complicated or something they look for help 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.019
 I 'm going to help them too 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.819
 study all the provisions but more 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.260
 well that you feel like it because if you 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.379
 like something you have to go on and on 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 with your goal then get to do the already 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.019
