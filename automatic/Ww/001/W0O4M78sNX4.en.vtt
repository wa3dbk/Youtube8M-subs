00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
cover to cover within cold do you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
cover to cover within cold do you
utilize<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.500> radar<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.579> its<00:00:47.789> maximum

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
utilize the radar to its maximum

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
utilize the radar to its maximum
potential<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:48.960> called<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.469> radar<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
potential then called the radar is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
potential then called the radar is
incredibly<00:00:50.610> key<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.750> cannot<00:00:52.260> utilize<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
incredibly key if you cannot utilize the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.670 
incredibly key if you cannot utilize the
radar<00:00:53.340> properly<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.210> probably

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
radar properly then you're probably

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
radar properly then you're probably
nothing<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> certain

nothing to do very well in a certain
game<00:00:57.420> map<00:00:58.170> knowledge<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.980> another<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
game map knowledge is another thing that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
game map knowledge is another thing that
is<00:00:59.820> very<00:00:59.910> very<00:01:00.210> important<00:01:00.989> within<00:01:01.199> called<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
is very very important within called the

it<00:01:47.520> comes<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.020> using

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it comes to that but if I'm using

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.080 
it comes to that but if I'm using
something<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.860> SMG<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.520> usually<00:01:50.790> tend<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
something like an SMG I usually tend to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
something like an SMG I usually tend to
rush<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> rounds<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.979> an<00:01:53.070> SMG

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
rush the rounds just because with an SMG

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.639 
rush the rounds just because with an SMG
you<00:01:53.909> move<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.420> bit<00:01:54.540> quicker<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you move a little bit quicker now the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.230 
you move a little bit quicker now the
thing<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> every<00:01:56.549> single<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> those

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
thing is that every single one of those

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.840 
thing is that every single one of those
players<00:01:57.540> Styles<00:01:58.110> has<00:01:58.469> its<00:01:58.770> own<00:01:58.920> pros<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.310> its

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
players Styles has its own pros and its

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.719 
players Styles has its own pros and its
own<00:02:00.000> cons<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.500> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.890> rush<00:02:02.130> around<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
own cons if you want to rush around you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
own cons if you want to rush around you
want<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.240> successfully<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
want to do this successfully you need to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.490 
want to do this successfully you need to
have<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.340> pretty<00:02:05.670> decent<00:02:06.119> reaction<00:02:07.020> time

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
have a pretty decent reaction time

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
have a pretty decent reaction time
especially<00:02:07.770> within<00:02:08.310> code<00:02:08.550> videos<00:02:08.910> because

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
especially within code videos because

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.240 
especially within code videos because
your<00:02:09.989> average<00:02:10.080> skills<00:02:10.530> harm<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> be

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
your average skills harm is going to be

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.880 
your average skills harm is going to be
something<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.700> 0.3<00:02:12.569> seconds<00:02:13.050> we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
something like 0.3 seconds we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
something like 0.3 seconds we
is<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.580> whole<00:02:14.760> lot<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.450> your

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
is really not a whole lot so if your

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.809 
is really not a whole lot so if your
reaction<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.380> isn't<00:02:16.590> great<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.790> not

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
reaction time isn't great you're not

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.670 
reaction time isn't great you're not
going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:18.720> rushing<00:02:19.170> around<00:02:19.260> within

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to do well rushing around within

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
going to do well rushing around within
cold<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.100> goes<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.600> main

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
cold it goes and this is one of the main

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.780 
cold it goes and this is one of the main
reasons<00:02:22.230> why<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.220> game<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
reasons why I think that this game is a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910 
reasons why I think that this game is a
little<00:02:24.030> bit<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:24.360> slow<00:02:24.600> pace<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:25.709> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
little bit more slow pace then you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.550 
little bit more slow pace then you
preview<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.640> three<00:02:26.850> titles<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:28.290> if

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
preview all three titles just because if

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.949 
preview all three titles just because if
you<00:02:28.740> rush<00:02:28.980> around<00:02:29.160> within<00:02:29.550> cold<00:02:29.940> goes<00:02:30.270> you're

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
you rush around within cold goes you're

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.420 
you rush around within cold goes you're
probably<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.709> taken<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.190> by

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
probably going to get taken out by

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
probably going to get taken out by
someone<00:02:32.760> who<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.270> simply<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:33.840> rushing<00:02:34.200> around

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
someone who is simply not rushing around

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.010 
someone who is simply not rushing around
by<00:02:35.070> someone<00:02:35.550> who's<00:02:35.760> simply<00:02:36.180> waiting<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.900> you

said<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.489> should<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:08.940> utilize<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.380> radar

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
said you should really utilize the radar

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.790 
said you should really utilize the radar
the<00:03:10.830> radar<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.370> key<00:03:11.730> within<00:03:12.690> código<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
the radar is key within código this is

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.590 
the radar is key within código this is
something<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.489> personally<00:03:14.850> tend<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.450> look

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
something that I personally tend to look

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.979 
something that I personally tend to look
at<00:03:15.840> about<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.769> twenty<00:03:17.459> five<00:03:17.489> percent<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
at about like twenty five percent of the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.900 
at about like twenty five percent of the
time<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.470> look<00:03:19.769> at<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> radar<00:03:20.190> quiet<00:03:20.489> lots

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
time I do look at the radar quiet lots

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940 
time I do look at the radar quiet lots
if<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.660> look<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.019> radar<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.920> of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
if I look at the radar I can kind of

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
if I look at the radar I can kind of
like<00:03:23.070> tell<00:03:23.370> where<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.060> should<00:03:24.120> go<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.690> what<00:03:24.900> I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
like tell where I should go and what I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.840 
like tell where I should go and what I
shouldn't<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:26.190> see<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.610> there<00:03:26.820> are

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
shouldn't go if you see that there are

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850 
shouldn't go if you see that there are
teammates<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.510> front<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.230> means

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
teammates in front of you that means

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.110 
teammates in front of you that means
that<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> should<00:03:29.340> probably<00:03:29.700> turn<00:03:30.090> around

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
that you should probably turn around

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.509 
that you should probably turn around
because<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.019> opponents<00:03:31.560> are<00:03:31.709> probably<00:03:32.370> going

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
because the opponents are probably going

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.699 
because the opponents are probably going
to<00:03:32.610> spawning<00:03:32.940> behind<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:34.470> team

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to spawning behind you think team

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.590 
to spawning behind you think team
deathmatch<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.239> game<00:03:36.420> mode

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
deathmatch and that is the game mode

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.110 
deathmatch and that is the game mode
that<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.810> play<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.230> most<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:38.040> spawns<00:03:38.370> are<00:03:38.640> very

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that I play the most the spawns are very

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.090 
that I play the most the spawns are very
predictable<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.900> basically<00:03:40.260> take<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.860> two

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
predictable you basically take the two

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220 
predictable you basically take the two
teammates<00:03:41.610> they're<00:03:42.329> on<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.570> outskirts<00:03:43.110> of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
teammates they're on the outskirts of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.140 
teammates they're on the outskirts of
the<00:03:43.290> map<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.799> draw<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.519> circle<00:03:44.880> around

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the map and you draw a circle around

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
the map and you draw a circle around
them<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.840> your<00:03:46.230> opponents<00:03:46.709> are<00:03:46.799> probably<00:03:47.130> not

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
them and your opponents are probably not

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.830 
them and your opponents are probably not
going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.610> spawning<00:03:47.940> within<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.540> circle

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
going to be spawning within that circle

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840 
going to be spawning within that circle
that's<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.380> pretty<00:03:49.530> much<00:03:49.739> how<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
that's just pretty much how it is but

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.160 
that's just pretty much how it is but
then<00:03:51.030> again<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.540> want<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.750> play<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.049> safe

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
then again if you want to play it safe

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.800 
then again if you want to play it safe
you<00:03:52.560> map<00:03:52.739> awareness<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.610> map<00:03:53.760> knowledge<00:03:54.060> are

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you map awareness and map knowledge are

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.449 
you map awareness and map knowledge are
two<00:03:55.049> other<00:03:55.260> things<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.769> are<00:03:55.980> very<00:03:56.280> very

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
two other things that are very very

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.060 
two other things that are very very
important<00:03:56.970> within<00:03:57.900> Coll<00:03:58.140> videos<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.799> maps

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
important within Coll videos the maps

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.860 
important within Coll videos the maps
are<00:03:59.340> pretty<00:03:59.700> huge<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.209> fact<00:04:00.239> they're<00:04:00.660> pretty

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
are pretty huge in fact they're pretty

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.800 
are pretty huge in fact they're pretty
enormous<00:04:01.400> compared<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.489> previous<00:04:03.090> titles<00:04:03.570> and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
enormous compared to previous titles and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.840 
enormous compared to previous titles and
this<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.380> also<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.709> main<00:04:04.920> reason<00:04:04.950> why<00:04:05.400> rushing

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
this is also the main reason why rushing

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.400 
this is also the main reason why rushing
doesn't<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.269> work<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.660> too<00:04:06.959> well

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
doesn't really work out too well

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.810 
doesn't really work out too well
just<00:04:07.829> be<00:04:07.950> care<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:08.430> as<00:04:08.489> well<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
just be care as well as well as you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.000 
just be care as well as well as you
probably<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.360> very<00:04:09.630> easy<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.079> hear

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
probably know it's very easy to hear

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.160 
probably know it's very easy to hear
footsteps<00:04:11.310> within<00:04:11.820> this<00:04:11.880> game<00:04:12.180> then<00:04:12.870> again

hear your enemies very easily you can't

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.279 
hear your enemies very easily you can't
tell<00:04:24.270> whether<00:04:24.479> they're<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.900> be<00:04:24.960> coming

hear<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.479> difference<00:04:31.870> between<00:04:31.960> those<00:04:32.410> two

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
but apart from that you really can't

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.320 
but apart from that you really can't
tell<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.949> is<00:04:36.070> why<00:04:36.220> playing<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.729> safe<00:04:37.000> and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
tell and that is why playing it safe and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.510 
tell and that is why playing it safe and
playing<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.930> bit<00:04:37.960> more<00:04:38.199> defensive<00:04:38.530> are

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
playing it a bit more defensive are

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.670 
playing it a bit more defensive are
probably<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.300> best<00:04:40.479> ways<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.050> play<00:04:41.290> with<00:04:41.500> ink

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
probably the best ways to play with ink

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.830 
probably the best ways to play with ink
over<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.040> ghost<00:04:42.190> although<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.300> can<00:04:43.570> get<00:04:43.780> a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
over the ghost although it can get a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.180 
over the ghost although it can get a
little<00:04:44.080> bit<00:04:44.320> boring<00:04:44.590> every<00:04:44.860> now<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.100> then

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
little bit boring every now and then

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.219 
little bit boring every now and then
although<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.760> does<00:04:46.000> make<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.419> game<00:04:46.600> a<00:04:46.900> little

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
although it does make the game a little

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.950 
although it does make the game a little
bit<00:04:47.680> less<00:04:48.010> fast-paced<00:04:48.790> that's<00:04:49.540> just<00:04:49.780> how<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
bit less fast-paced that's just how the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.600 
bit less fast-paced that's just how the
maps<00:04:50.320> are<00:04:50.530> bill<00:04:50.710> that's<00:04:50.979> just<00:04:51.190> what<00:04:51.370> works

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
maps are bill that's just what works

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.850 
maps are bill that's just what works
best<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.389> personally<00:04:53.020> prefer<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.590> play<00:04:53.800> it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
best I personally prefer just play it

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.650 
best I personally prefer just play it
safe<00:04:54.130> just<00:04:54.370> walk<00:04:54.550> around<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:55.030> little<00:04:55.150> bit

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
safe just walk around a little bit

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.689 
safe just walk around a little bit
don't<00:04:56.139> rush<00:04:56.410> too<00:04:56.710> much<00:04:56.979> don't<00:04:57.400> play<00:04:57.639> too

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
don't rush too much don't play too

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.330
