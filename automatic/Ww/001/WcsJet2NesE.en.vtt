00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that you start with a wire covered in

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
that you start with a wire covered in
floral<00:01:21.900> tape<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.350> bend<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> end<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
floral tape and you bend the end to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.440 
floral tape and you bend the end to
create<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.330> hook<00:01:25.880> under<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> tin<00:01:27.180> foil

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it under the tin foil just to create an

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
it under the tin foil just to create an
airtight<00:01:33.860> um<00:01:34.860> an<00:01:35.390> air<00:01:36.390> tight<00:01:36.829> space<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
airtight um an air tight space for it if

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
airtight um an air tight space for it if
you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> um<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.290> air<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.100> harden

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you have it um in the air it will harden

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.929 
you have it um in the air it will harden
as<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:41.939> working<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.549> become

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
as you're working and it will become

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
as you're working and it will become
crumbling<00:01:45.750> cracking<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.920> won't<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
crumbling cracking and it won't do so

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.020 
crumbling cracking and it won't do so
vile<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:48.960> by<00:01:49.259> molding<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.030> like

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
vile so you start off by molding on like

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
vile so you start off by molding on like
that<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.619> press<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:53.130> against

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that and then I just press it up against

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
that and then I just press it up against
them<00:01:53.640> out<00:01:53.759> i'm<00:01:53.909> working<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.049> creates

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
them out i'm working with and it creates

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.100 
them out i'm working with and it creates
a<00:01:55.500> flat<00:01:55.799> edge<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.540> i've<00:01:57.750> already<00:01:57.899> gone

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a flat edge for it so i've already gone

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.319 
a flat edge for it so i've already gone
ahead<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> cutters<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.060> cut<00:02:00.180> out

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
ahead and use the cutters and cut out

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
ahead and use the cutters and cut out
two<00:02:00.659> daisies<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.829> i<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.270> on

and I'm going to do this again if it
doesn't<00:02:23.310> look<00:02:23.459> right<00:02:23.670> at<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.030> point<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.360> can

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
doesn't look right at this point you can

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.830 
doesn't look right at this point you can
just<00:02:24.660> move<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.110> fix<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.709> soft<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.660> get

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
just move it and fix it it's soft so get

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.030 
just move it and fix it it's soft so get
it<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.049> look<00:02:28.170> how<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.950> look

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it to look how you want it to look

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.500 
it to look how you want it to look
because<00:02:29.280> once<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:29.670> hard<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.030> hard<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
because once it's hard it's hard you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.610 
because once it's hard it's hard you
can't<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:31.110> anything<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
can't do anything about it and then I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
can't do anything about it and then I
have<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.310> ball<00:02:35.849> shaping<00:02:36.629> tool<00:02:37.670> give<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> some

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
have a ball shaping tool give it some

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.089 
have a ball shaping tool give it some
shape<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.480> center<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> at<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.829> point

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
shape in the center and so at this point

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.970 
shape in the center and so at this point
I<00:02:44.489> take<00:02:45.180> them<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.720> layer<00:02:45.930> them<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.349> have

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
I take them and I just layer them I have

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.390 
I take them and I just layer them I have
a<00:02:47.010> solution<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.790> water<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.540> meringue<00:02:48.750> powder

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and I just brush the centered the center

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.990 
and I just brush the centered the center
part<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.069> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> position<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.879> like

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
part and I'm going to position it like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.630 
part and I'm going to position it like
that<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:02.700> goes<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.500> center<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:05.489> sure

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
that and here goes the center not sure

that and here goes the center not sure
if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.910> see<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> center<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.140> don't

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
if you could see in the center I don't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.289 
if you could see in the center I don't
think<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.970> cornmeal<00:03:09.360> needed<00:03:10.290> into<00:03:10.799> the

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
think so I have cornmeal needed into the

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.030 
think so I have cornmeal needed into the
yellow<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.319> gives<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.680> some

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
yellow it kind of gives it some

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.199 
yellow it kind of gives it some
realistic<00:03:15.030> pollen<00:03:15.569> look<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:17.069> have<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.940> shape

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
realistic pollen look so I have a shape

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.849 
realistic pollen look so I have a shape
dryer<00:03:18.569> right<00:03:18.750> over<00:03:18.959> here<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.440> dusted

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859

top of it and i'll go is the step and
then<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.000> becomes<00:03:36.269> hard<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.470> stem<00:03:37.739> will

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
then it becomes hard and the stem will

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.220 
then it becomes hard and the stem will
stay<00:03:38.340> right<00:03:38.609> on<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:40.319> top<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.829> Daisy<00:03:42.230> just
