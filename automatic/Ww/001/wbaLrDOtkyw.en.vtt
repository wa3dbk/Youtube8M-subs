00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.920 
p30 cos this is Daisy from put a chicken
a<00:00:10.860> -<00:00:11.010> -<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.429> today<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.150> your<00:00:12.799> smoothie<00:00:13.799> product

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.410 

we've<00:00:18.930> heard<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.740> many<00:00:20.010> many<00:00:20.279> years<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
we've heard for many many years that we

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.140 
we've heard for many many years that we
have<00:00:21.720> way<00:00:22.140> too<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.680> sodium<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.460> our<00:00:23.580> diet<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
have way too much sodium in our diet and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.810 
have way too much sodium in our diet and
on<00:00:24.720> top<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.650> even<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.070> table<00:00:26.580> salt

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
on top of that we even have table salt

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.720 
on top of that we even have table salt
to<00:00:27.090> add<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> sodium<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.429> already

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to add on to the sodium that's already

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.209 
to add on to the sodium that's already
in<00:00:30.029> our<00:00:30.269> food<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:31.019> sodium<00:00:31.500> does<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:32.160> at

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
in our food what sodium does are at

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.709 
in our food what sodium does are at
least<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> things<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> does<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
least one of the things that it does to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.680 
least one of the things that it does to
our<00:00:33.780> body<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> raises<00:00:34.950> blood<00:00:35.219> pressure<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
our body is it raises blood pressure the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
our body is it raises blood pressure the
reason<00:00:37.079> being<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.950> puts<00:00:38.219> pressure<00:00:38.700> on

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
reason being is that it puts pressure on

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.830 
reason being is that it puts pressure on
many<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.870> our<00:00:40.020> organs<00:00:40.500> including<00:00:41.129> our<00:00:41.280> kidneys

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
many of our organs including our kidneys

many of our organs including our kidneys
including<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:42.960> heart<00:00:43.230> therefore<00:00:44.000> our

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
including our heart therefore our

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
including our heart therefore our
arteries<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.739> makes<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.489> body<00:00:47.760> hold<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
arteries it makes our body hold on to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.549 
arteries it makes our body hold on to
water<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.520> extra<00:00:51.480> water<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> our<00:00:52.170> body's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
water this extra water that our body's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.150 
water this extra water that our body's
holding<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.750> strains<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:55.110> body<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
holding on to strains our body and as a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
holding on to strains our body and as a
result<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:57.149> raises<00:00:57.780> blood<00:00:58.230> pressure<00:00:58.379> now

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
result it raises blood pressure now

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.230 
result it raises blood pressure now

know oranges are amazing for their
vitamin<00:01:19.330> C<00:01:19.540> but<00:01:20.320> what<00:01:20.710> many<00:01:21.009> people<00:01:21.220> don't

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
vitamin C but what many people don't

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.499 
vitamin C but what many people don't
know<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.300> these<00:01:22.890> round<00:01:23.890> things<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:25.210> a

know is that these round things have a
lot<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:26.170> potassium<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.280> course<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.790> a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
lot of potassium so of course in a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.999 
lot of potassium so of course in a
mixture<00:01:28.330> that's<00:01:28.659> dedicated<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.350> blood

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009

I'm really absorbing the iron so and a
little<00:02:38.629> bit<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:39.110> tumeric<00:02:40.030> great<00:02:41.030> stuff<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.890> I
