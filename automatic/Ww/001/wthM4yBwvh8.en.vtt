that was in November last year and so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.410 
that was in November last year and so
it's<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> long<00:00:49.829> recovery<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.030> longer

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's just been a long recovery I longer

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's just been a long recovery I longer
than<00:00:51.539> expected<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.559> been<00:00:52.770> able<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
than expected and I've just been able to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
than expected and I've just been able to
start<00:00:53.610> tumbling<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> past<00:00:54.719> five<00:00:55.320> weeks

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
start tumbling for the past five weeks

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
start tumbling for the past five weeks
so<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> tricky<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.780> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so it's going to be tricky one but it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
so it's going to be tricky one but it's
been<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.530> recovery<00:00:59.399> year<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.820> me<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.149> just
