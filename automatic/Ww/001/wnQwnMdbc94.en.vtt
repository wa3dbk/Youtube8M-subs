a cell capture piece that you just flick

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
a cell capture piece that you just flick
up<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> top<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.260> compatible<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.309> the

which<00:01:49.609> you<00:01:50.329> guys<00:01:50.539> can<00:01:50.600> hack<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.409> code<00:01:51.590> because

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
which you guys can hack the code because

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.429 
which you guys can hack the code because
I<00:01:52.189> already<00:01:52.369> used<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:54.969> so<00:01:56.109> you<00:01:57.109> get<00:01:57.289> that

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
I already used it so you get that

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.249 
I already used it so you get that
backwards

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
backwards

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.690 
backwards
that's<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.469> backwards<00:02:01.069> because<00:02:01.219> I'm<00:02:01.490> showing

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
that's the backwards because I'm showing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.999 
that's the backwards because I'm showing
you<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.289> on<00:02:03.289> camera

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.520 

yeah<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.780> hates<00:02:08.780> trees<00:02:09.379> here<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:11.470> all<00:02:12.470> right

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
yeah and hates trees here and all right

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.640 
yeah and hates trees here and all right
this<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.519> what<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.940> need<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.690> through<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
this is what you need for it through the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
this is what you need for it through the
code<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:18.220> h30<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.970> no<00:02:20.510> zero<00:02:21.200> zero<00:02:21.590> zero

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
code and h30 there no zero zero zero

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.680 
code and h30 there no zero zero zero
what<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> mean

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
mhm 3 0 0 0 and L that's the code and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.869 
mhm 3 0 0 0 and L that's the code and
then<00:02:31.610> that's<00:02:31.880> all<00:02:32.090> yeah<00:02:33.549> you<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:34.730> put
