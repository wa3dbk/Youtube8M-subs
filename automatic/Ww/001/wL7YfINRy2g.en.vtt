00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
how it came along and I've done a couple

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
how it came along and I've done a couple
of<00:00:14.820> videos<00:00:15.120> showing<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.109> know<00:00:16.230> how

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
of videos showing just you know how

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.390 
of videos showing just you know how
these<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.250> dried<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.680> over<00:00:19.680> time<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
these have dried out over time and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.070 
these have dried out over time and
basically<00:00:21.090> they've<00:00:21.330> gotten<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.779> light

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
basically they've gotten really light

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
basically they've gotten really light
and<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.930> seeds<00:00:24.930> inside<00:00:26.119> shake

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and the and the seeds inside shake

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
and the and the seeds inside shake
around<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.869> tells<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.289> they're

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
around so that tells me that they're

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.830 
around so that tells me that they're
ready<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.390> though<00:00:30.800> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:32.840> some

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
ready you can see though there are some

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.799 
ready you can see though there are some
spots<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.800> where<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.600> outer

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
spots on here where you know that outer

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.799 
spots on here where you know that outer
skin<00:00:37.309> could<00:00:38.309> serve<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> come<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
skin could serve to come off a little

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
skin could serve to come off a little
bit<00:00:40.050> more<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.370> polish

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
bit more if you want it to really polish

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.529 
bit more if you want it to really polish
them<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:43.500> them<00:00:43.680> look<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:43.980> fancy

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
them up and and make them look all fancy

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
them up and and make them look all fancy
so<00:00:45.539> basically<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.739> done<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.309> show

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so basically what I've done just to show

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.950 
so basically what I've done just to show
that<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> steps<00:00:48.149> along<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> way<00:00:48.570> here

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that kind of steps along the way here

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
that kind of steps along the way here
was<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.250> taken<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> these<00:00:51.750> gourds

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
was you know taken one of these gourds

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.920 
was you know taken one of these gourds
here<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.670> tried<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> couple<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.539> things<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
here and I tried a couple of things to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
here and I tried a couple of things to
try<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> clean<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> kind

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
try to clean you know some of the kind

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.689 
try to clean you know some of the kind
of<00:00:57.809> scrappy<00:00:58.140> stuff<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> side<00:00:59.370> whatever

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
of scrappy stuff off the side whatever

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
of scrappy stuff off the side whatever
was<00:00:59.969> left<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> skin<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.020> basically

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
was left of the skin you know basically

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
was left of the skin you know basically
using<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.980> handheld<00:01:02.699> scouring<00:01:03.449> pad<00:01:03.660> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
using a handheld scouring pad or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
using a handheld scouring pad or
something<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.439> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
something like that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.359 
something like that
in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> end<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> found<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.130> very

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
in the end what I found to be very

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.859 
in the end what I found to be very
effective<00:01:08.790> although<00:01:09.299> maybe<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> best

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
effective although maybe not the best

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.850 
effective although maybe not the best
cosmetically<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.330> putting<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.780> yeah<00:01:13.290> into

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cosmetically was putting this yeah into

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.179 
cosmetically was putting this yeah into
a<00:01:13.950> drill<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> basically<00:01:16.380> putting<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a drill so basically putting that in and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.880 
a drill so basically putting that in and
this<00:01:17.280> basically<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.970> spins<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this basically has spins around and and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.429 
this basically has spins around and and
does<00:01:20.100> indeed<00:01:20.400> pull<00:01:20.729> off<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
does indeed pull off you know all of the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
does indeed pull off you know all of the
all<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> crusty<00:01:24.030> stuff<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
all of the crusty stuff here which I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
all of the crusty stuff here which I
guess<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> important<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> gourd<00:01:26.850> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
guess is important if it's a gourd that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
guess is important if it's a gourd that
you're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.420> painting<00:01:28.009> many<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you're going to be painting many of the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're going to be painting many of the
websites<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.820> recommend<00:01:30.659> using<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:32.420> face<00:01:33.420> mask

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
websites do recommend using a face mask

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.100 
websites do recommend using a face mask
just<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> keep<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> dust<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
just to keep the dust from all of the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
just to keep the dust from all of the
fungus<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.409> mold<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.610> whatever<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> heck<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
fungus and mold or whatever the heck it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.609 
fungus and mold or whatever the heck it
is<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> grows<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> outside<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
is that grows on the outside of the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
is that grows on the outside of the
gourd<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.310> keep<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.909> keep<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.450> breathing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
gourd to keep to keep you from breathing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
gourd to keep to keep you from breathing
that<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> dust<00:01:43.829> mask<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.880> guess<00:01:45.030> along<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that a dust mask and I guess along the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
that a dust mask and I guess along the
same<00:01:45.570> lines<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.619> safety<00:01:46.890> goggles

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
same lines if you have safety goggles

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
same lines if you have safety goggles
pop<00:01:47.610> those<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> keep<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.960> dust

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
pop those on as well to keep that dust

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
pop those on as well to keep that dust
from<00:01:49.259> getting<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.710> eyes<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.280> did<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> did

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
from getting in your eyes I did I did

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.429 
from getting in your eyes I did I did
basically<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:53.009> job<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.140> see

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
basically that job with you can see

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.910 
basically that job with you can see
though<00:01:55.740> how<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.969> did<00:01:57.240> scratch<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.320> outer

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
though how it did scratch the outer

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
though how it did scratch the outer
shell<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> gourd<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.149> guess<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
shell of the gourd and I guess if this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
shell of the gourd and I guess if this
was<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.500> fancy<00:02:01.979> like

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
was going to be something fancy like

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
was going to be something fancy like
that<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.790> selling<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that I was going to be selling you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160 
that I was going to be selling you
probably<00:02:04.320> wouldn't<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:06.170> unnatural

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
probably wouldn't like the unnatural

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.089 
probably wouldn't like the unnatural
look<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.479> scrapes<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.560> I'll

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
look of of the scrapes on there so I'll

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.220 
look of of the scrapes on there so I'll
experiment<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.940> other<00:02:12.090> ways<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.110> in

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
experiment with some other ways but in

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
experiment with some other ways but in
the<00:02:13.319> meantime

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the meantime

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.260 
the meantime
what<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> really<00:02:14.460> wanted<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> show<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.030> the

what I really wanted to show you the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.130 
what I really wanted to show you the
stage<00:02:15.569> here<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:17.030> using<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.830> circle<00:02:19.830> hole<00:02:20.190> saw<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
stage here is using a circle hole saw to

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.840 
stage here is using a circle hole saw to
cut<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> hole<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.100> birdhouse<00:02:23.490> gourd

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
cut a hole into the birdhouse gourd

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.960 
cut a hole into the birdhouse gourd
itself<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.560> basically<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.880> know

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
hooked up to a drill this circle hole

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.660 
hooked up to a drill this circle hole
saw<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.570> here<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.170> basically<00:02:32.070> what<00:02:32.340> I've<00:02:32.459> done

birdhouse there fact you can see the bit

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.190 
birdhouse there fact you can see the bit
of<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> birdhouse<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.459> still<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.200> hold

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
of the birdhouse it's still in the hold

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.330 
of the birdhouse it's still in the hold
of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.410> circle<00:02:47.070> hole<00:02:47.250> saw<00:02:47.580> there<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:49.340> now

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
of the circle hole saw there and now

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.160 
of the circle hole saw there and now
what<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.300> here<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.950> take<00:02:52.950> my

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you can see lots and lots of seeds

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.000 
you can see lots and lots of seeds
coming<00:03:11.100> out<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.800> there

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
sort of like the membrane I guess from

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.100 
sort of like the membrane I guess from
the<00:03:24.180> inner<00:03:24.329> side<00:03:25.019> or<00:03:25.320> inner<00:03:25.530> shell<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
circle hole saw you know it does give a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.650 
circle hole saw you know it does give a
nice<00:03:46.270> clean<00:03:47.270> round<00:03:47.660> hole<00:03:48.370> right<00:03:49.370> there<00:03:49.660> it's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
nice clean round hole right there it's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.960 
nice clean round hole right there it's
my<00:03:50.840> first<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.440> I've<00:03:51.560> done<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.730> one

is a two inch hole wide hole which is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.970 
is a two inch hole wide hole which is
probably<00:03:55.580> too<00:03:55.910> wide<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:56.209> or<00:03:57.140> much<00:03:57.590> wider<00:03:57.860> than

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
probably too wide for or much wider than

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.520 
probably too wide for or much wider than
needed<00:03:58.610> for<00:03:58.850> most<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.020> birds<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.440> I'm

with making the birdhouse gourds the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.310 
with making the birdhouse gourds the
next<00:05:11.360> thing<00:05:11.510> I'll<00:05:11.630> do<00:05:11.840> is<00:05:12.080> basically<00:05:12.710> to

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
next thing I'll do is basically to

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840 
next thing I'll do is basically to
probably<00:05:15.320> I'll<00:05:15.410> stain<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.860> with<00:05:16.460> either

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
probably I'll stain that with either

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.600 
probably I'll stain that with either
leather<00:05:17.270> paint<00:05:17.660> or<00:05:18.100> stain<00:05:19.100> or<00:05:19.580> something

leather paint or stain or something

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.370 
leather paint or stain or something
along<00:05:20.090> those<00:05:20.150> lines<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.720> could<00:05:20.840> paint<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.229> if

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
along those lines you could paint it if

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.810 
along those lines you could paint it if
you<00:05:21.470> want<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.919> be<00:05:22.010> colorful<00:05:22.370> for

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
you want it to be colorful for

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.600 
you want it to be colorful for
ornamental<00:05:23.210> purposes<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.950> kind<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.460> whatever

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
ornamental purposes so kind of whatever

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.969 
ornamental purposes so kind of whatever
whatever<00:05:26.210> suits<00:05:26.539> your<00:05:26.720> style<00:05:26.990> along<00:05:27.800> those

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
whatever suits your style along those

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.760 
whatever suits your style along those
lines<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.840> gets<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.169> other<00:05:30.320> one<00:05:30.560> thing

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
lines and it gets the other one thing

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.570 
lines and it gets the other one thing
I'll<00:05:30.890> point<00:05:30.919> out<00:05:31.160> you<00:05:31.370> could<00:05:31.669> just<00:05:31.940> use<00:05:32.210> a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
I'll point out you could just use a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.600 
I'll point out you could just use a
drill<00:05:34.580> bit<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.720> basically<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:37.280> know<00:05:37.370> has<00:05:37.580> a

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
drill bit that basically you know has a

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.779 
drill bit that basically you know has a
you<00:05:38.390> know<00:05:38.479> has<00:05:38.660> a<00:05:38.800> expander<00:05:39.800> here<00:05:40.100> you<00:05:40.700> know

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
you know has a expander here you know

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.219 
you know has a expander here you know
this<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.300> drill<00:05:41.659> in<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:41.990> then<00:05:42.110> it

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
this so you drill in and then it

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.159 
this so you drill in and then it
eventually<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:43.039> can<00:05:43.280> drill<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.520> bigger<00:05:43.789> hole

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
eventually you can drill a bigger hole

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.420 
eventually you can drill a bigger hole
but<00:05:45.169> this<00:05:45.440> is<00:05:45.680> probably

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
but this is probably

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.150 
but this is probably
not<00:05:46.610> quite<00:05:47.440> wide<00:05:48.440> enough<00:05:48.470> this<00:05:48.950> is<00:05:49.010> a

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
not quite wide enough this is a

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.340 
not quite wide enough this is a
three-quarter<00:05:49.820> inch<00:05:49.850> probably<00:05:50.630> tilt<00:05:50.990> still

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
three-quarter inch probably tilt still

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.280 
three-quarter inch probably tilt still
it's<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.220> little<00:05:52.670> small<00:05:52.940> for<00:05:53.300> for<00:05:53.900> most<00:05:54.020> of<00:05:54.230> the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
it's a little small for for most of the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.820 
it's a little small for for most of the
birds<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.310> that<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.540> scoop<00:05:56.810> on<00:05:57.050> what<00:05:57.800> I

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
birds so that is the scoop on what I

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.130 
birds so that is the scoop on what I
wanted<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.280> show<00:05:58.460> here<00:05:58.760> in<00:05:58.910> terms<00:05:59.840> of<00:06:00.080> the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
wanted to show here in terms of the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.080 
wanted to show here in terms of the
update<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:00.740> my<00:06:01.070> birdhouse<00:06:01.310> gourds
