excites<00:02:21.110> what<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.350> told<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.830> there's<00:02:22.700> where

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
excites what I told you there's where

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.240 
excites what I told you there's where
the<00:02:23.000> car<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:23.570> be<00:02:23.750> right<00:02:24.020> here<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the car would be right here this is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.100 
the car would be right here this is
where<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> children<00:02:26.270> would<00:02:26.390> play<00:02:26.630> right<00:02:26.900> here

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
where the children would play right here

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.500 
where the children would play right here
in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> waterfall<00:02:27.800> area<00:02:28.240> these<00:02:29.240> would

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
in the waterfall area these would

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.410 
in the waterfall area these would
probably<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.930> stairs<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.320> believe<00:02:31.330> probably<00:02:32.330> be

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
probably be stairs I believe probably be

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.930 
probably be stairs I believe probably be
like<00:02:32.600> corridor<00:02:33.170> some<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:34.610> would<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:34.850> another

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
like corridor some this would be another

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.880 
like corridor some this would be another
balcony<00:02:35.360> probably<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.350> would<00:02:36.590> be<00:02:36.770> another

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
