and<00:03:46.400> mainly<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> only<00:03:47.669> reason<00:03:47.880> i<00:03:47.940> made<00:03:48.120> this

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
and mainly the only reason i made this

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.059 
and mainly the only reason i made this
is<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.599> i<00:03:48.630> could<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.989> one<00:03:49.139> two<00:03:49.319> three<00:03:49.799> four<00:03:50.010> five

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
is so i could do one two three four five

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.930 
is so i could do one two three four five
four<00:03:50.700> three<00:03:50.730> two<00:03:51.239> one<00:03:51.919> because<00:03:52.919> if<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.639> didn't

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
four three two one because if I didn't

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.670 
four three two one because if I didn't
