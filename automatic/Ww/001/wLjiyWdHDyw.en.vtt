 Hello everyone, Kuzmichyov Alexey 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.290
 and we continue to learn the basics of adobe 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.090
 photoshop 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.640
 and I today 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.969
 we will learn to transform 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.399
 photo buyers drawing 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:14.809
 now you see I have already finished 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.299
 result 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.320
 let's open the picture we 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.650
 want to change 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 So 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 dial any 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.339
 Well, for example the house 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.740
 the one that I have 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.080
 enlarged 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.290
 and now first thing we go mode 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530
 image here is a collection 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.200
 and we have to clean the identity 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.060
 raise saturation found 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.540
 image because 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.900
 she has more juicy colors 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 that's about like somewhere on plus 50 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920
 leave 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 and save 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.380
 now we need to go filter 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.870
 blur 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.820
 we are galushin type 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 and blur our drawing by about 2 pixels 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.130
 so here r 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.060
 save 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 and that there remained the one to apply 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 filters 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.470
 imitation watercolor 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 here it opens a window in which 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.020
 see the result 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.490
 our filters and here you can already 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.400
 play around with the settings 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.150
 add her dreams detail 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.670
 shadow depth 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.880
 and also the texture r 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 may increase add 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.080
 and here we are already looking 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.650
 and apply all the poignancy that 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.290
 more like a lattice 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 here we close attacks 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 and see that our drawing has changed 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.590
 and became watercolor r 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.290
 such a simple effect 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.310
 Putin is all very fragile we will consider 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.540
 things some filter 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.140
 that's all up to new meetings
