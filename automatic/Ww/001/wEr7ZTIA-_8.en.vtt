raising theory video essentially what
we've<00:00:22.650> done<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:22.860> is<00:00:23.040> I've<00:00:23.220> taken<00:00:23.340> 14<00:00:24.000> hands

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we've done here is I've taken 14 hands

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
we've done here is I've taken 14 hands
out<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:26.070> 1k<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> played<00:00:27.509> and<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.550> I've

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
out of a 1k that I played and that I've

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
out of a 1k that I played and that I've
been<00:00:29.760> raising<00:00:30.000> free<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> we've<00:00:31.500> taken<00:00:31.740> them

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
been raising free and we've taken them

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310 
been raising free and we've taken them
all<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.580> we're<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.449> to<00:00:33.660> look<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.080> them

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
all out and we're going to look at them

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.090 
all out and we're going to look at them
a<00:00:35.510> couple<00:00:36.510> things<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.019> should<00:00:37.350> keep<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
a couple things that we should keep in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.939 
a couple things that we should keep in
mind<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.730> though<00:00:38.970> I<00:00:39.350> mean<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
mind here though I mean this is out of a

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.969 
mind here though I mean this is out of a
hundred<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> twenty<00:00:41.820> hands<00:00:42.150> I<00:00:42.239> only<00:00:42.269> opened

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
hundred and twenty hands I only opened

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.619 
hundred and twenty hands I only opened
14<00:00:43.979> of<00:00:44.159> them<00:00:46.339> so<00:00:47.339> I<00:00:47.370> wasn't<00:00:47.909> playing<00:00:48.180> extremely

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
14 of them so I wasn't playing extremely

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.700 
14 of them so I wasn't playing extremely
lag<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.799> the<00:00:50.430> reason<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
lag and the reason for this

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.689 
lag and the reason for this
realistically<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.220> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> pots

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
realistically is because a lot of pots

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.039 
realistically is because a lot of pots
were<00:00:53.850> being<00:00:54.059> opened<00:00:54.330> in<00:00:54.420> front<00:00:54.659> of<00:00:54.750> me<00:00:54.839> it's<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
were being opened in front of me it's a

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.660 
were being opened in front of me it's a
1k<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:55.530> chances<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.400> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.580> get

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
1k so chances are you're going to get

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
1k so chances are you're going to get
more<00:00:56.820> pots<00:00:57.119> open<00:00:57.479> in<00:00:57.600> front<00:00:57.720> because<00:00:58.110> there's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
more pots open in front because there's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.859 
more pots open in front because there's
more<00:00:58.440> competent<00:00:58.949> players<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> lower<00:01:00.540> stakes

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
more competent players so I lower stakes

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.039 
more competent players so I lower stakes
you're<00:01:01.080> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.290> be<00:01:01.350> able<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.530> find

different spots to open up pots with

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.190 
different spots to open up pots with
suited<00:01:06.450> connectors<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> be

suited connectors you're going to be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
suited connectors you're going to be
able<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.100> often<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
able to do that a lot more often the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.120 
able to do that a lot more often the
other<00:01:09.420> thing<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:10.200> while<00:01:10.830> i'm<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.159> raising

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
other thing i do do while i'm in raising

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
other thing i do do while i'm in raising
pre<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> column<00:01:15.000> position<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.510> lot<00:01:15.660> more<00:01:16.110> as

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
pre is a column position a lot more as

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
pre is a column position a lot more as
well<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.760> try<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:17.940> play<00:01:18.150> try<00:01:18.990> play

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
well so I just try to play try play

calling in general has gotten somewhat

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.240 
calling in general has gotten somewhat
of<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.890> bad<00:01:26.670> name<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> online<00:01:28.830> poker

of a bad name in the online poker
community<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> mean<00:01:30.480> if<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.110> playing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
community but I mean if you're playing
really<00:01:31.530> Deeping<00:01:32.010> calling<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> positions

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
really Deeping calling it positions

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.780 
really Deeping calling it positions
never<00:01:33.510> really<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> bad<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.490> believe<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
never really that bad I believe this is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.190 
never really that bad I believe this is
like<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.060> third<00:01:36.300> or<00:01:36.570> fourth<00:01:36.840> hand<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> the

because I think a lot of people the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.690 
because I think a lot of people the
first<00:01:49.050> time<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> min<00:01:49.800> raise<00:01:49.980> they<00:01:50.220> they

first time I see a min raise they they

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
first time I see a min raise they they
react<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.330> it's<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.630> huge<00:01:51.900> hand<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> you're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
react that it's a huge hand and you're
trying<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.950> trap<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.330> really<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.690> want

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
trying to trap so you really don't want

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
trying to trap so you really don't want
it<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> huge<00:01:55.560> hint<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.780> won<00:01:58.050> the
