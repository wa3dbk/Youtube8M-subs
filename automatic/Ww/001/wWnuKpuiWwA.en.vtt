00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi they are young asus bergamaschi 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.810
 is not responsible for humans and vi 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 I present here at the bottom 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.420
 Berruto we announced las vegas 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.010
 in January because here in barcelona 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 we bring in the final version that 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.150
 will then be marketed in Italy 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 starting from the first week of April 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 the product is in my hand is the hotel 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 with two in the say let's say 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 then with 4gb of ram and it will be the first 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.999
 smartphone in the world to have 4 GB of ram 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.099
 and with 32gb of space available for 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.450
 put said storage applications e 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 something 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 what is that on this product here 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 we see it in the version with the clip 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.510
 cover of the acs where I have the possibility of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.790
 view in the blood clock with le 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.610
 main information then calls 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.470
 to e-mail messages 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.990
 rather than the weather rather than the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.700
 camera to click and then I have the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.770
 possibility or directly to shoot 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.400
 the photo then directly from the globe 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.510
 that not without opening 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.170
 An image 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.150
 so he took the photo 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.100
 I have the chance by holding the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.439
 finger on the edge of going to recall the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.210
 main functions therefore without having to 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.990
 slide the screen maybe call 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.909
 the main functions and also if it is 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.220
 I'm going to open it just to show you and it 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.200
 rejection see here the product itself is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.880
 then downloaded almost a third then 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.710
 this green band is the band that he 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.170
 is recharging recharge in this 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.110
 moment then I also see the status 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.630
 of product charge will do 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.649
 then see the phone in the version 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.649
 let's say without covers 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.860
 the screen off can turn it on with 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.650
 the classic tap tap that by now is 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 become fashionable rather than recall 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.950
 directly one of the applications that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.200
 are most commonly used 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.930
 camera for i do symbol of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 so then the zen chalk motion then 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.350
 I'm going to call the main ones 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 applications simply by drawing the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 letter of the initial 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.320
 if we still go on the part we say 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 the front of the boat said hardware 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.300
 occupies 72 percent of the surface of the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.240
 screen so you see we use gran 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 part of the surface the frames are 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 very thin 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.820
 of which you excuse with an angle we say of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.540
 view of the 85 degrees and therefore that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.890
 useful to give examples to the side turn 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 to show how thin 3 mm 9 of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.700
 edge that widens a little to 100 because 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.050
 because we have decided to give the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.820
 possibility of being able to keep it well in 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.850
 hand then compared to the flat phone 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.050
 it is more pleasant to keep it let's say 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.250
 with the hand for example for convenience 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have a flow born the buttons of the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.700
 volume in the back because 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.650
 increasing screen size 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.620
 it became more convenient to use these 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.530
 contents of rear camera from 13 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.020
 megapixel f 2.0 opening then does 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.850
 of the photos very bright among other things 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.890
 we have not adopted improved the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.450
 our pixel master technology that I 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.760
 lets you take photos in environments 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.980
 dark with a noticeable step quality 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.100
 noise rather than taking pictures in 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.270
 hdr then high resolution photos 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.990
 without losing we say no detail 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.330
 I also point out the 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.880
 two-tone LEDs this serves to 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.410
 mitigate to me you shoot with the led the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.150
 so close photos have photos with 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.770
 white faces then more photos 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 natural 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.310
 at the top we conditioned the button 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.990
 ignition but I told you to 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.690
 could be superfluous because 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.110
 many stop late rather than i 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.390
 buttons 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.070
 the insert for the earpiece in the part 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.030
 lower here merged by the system of 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.060
 then there will be anti-shoplifting 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.350
 power 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.260
 I'll show you other features 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.760
 interesting our zenga and therefore the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.320
 mass graphical interface 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.430
 we made us or customized 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.590
 completely the graphic interface 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.630
 compared to what is the offers of 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.140
 android lollipop what we have 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.980
 done further and then go to give 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.670
 to the end user 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.500
 the possibility of being able to customize 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.390
 completely the interface then me 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.060
 I do provide a base though 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.700
 holding down maybe to change the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.709
 icons then you can select one of the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.239
 many icon packs that I can put to 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.400
 provision therefore changes completely 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.190
 the icons rather than going to change 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.079
 the fonts go to change the color of the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.790
 screen then customize to the best 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.230
 the device also includes smart folders 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.850
 which are folders they contain 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.919
 applications can be 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.250
 customized to make let's say the 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.440
 even more unique device at the level 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.200
 hardware inside the processor a lot 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.150
 intel is the new moorfield version 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.770
 equini allows me to have power 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.200
 above all, 3d computing power 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.270
 however, battery consumption is not 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.680
 excessive and among other things here only for the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.410
 peak version of the zen fondue e 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.280
 we adopt the fast charge what is the 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.720
 possibility to charge the phone 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.990
 reach 70 per 60 percent cycles 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.700
 of the charge in less than 39 minutes 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.010
 so this sum is a very thing 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.230
 interesting on a 3,000 battery 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.300
 miles anyway a very product 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:12.700
 the game version in hand mounts one 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.700
 full hd screen t400 frames memory 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.380
 mounts a very bright screen of ps 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.720
 plus gorilla glass 3 so difficult 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.690
 perhaps from a rigare or from ruined therefore 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.130
 a product if it is not very interesting 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.050
 a repeat the products will be launched 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.440
 in the second first second week of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.180
 April 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.680
 we ca n't announce the price yet 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.110
 to the public, however, we say that we start from 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.370
 a base of $ 199 then 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.350
 obviously made the conversion into euro 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.210
 you can understand where we want to go 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.480
 however, I reiterate the concept it has on 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.740
 members rewards luxury for everyone 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.900
 therefore the will to be able to do 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.250
 use a high-end product 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.250
 with excellent low price
