00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello everyone and welcome to kitchen 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.410
 and fast 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.120
 today we are going to make the recipe 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.519
 strawberry millefeuille it's gone 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.690
 so for our recipe we will need 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 icing sugar cream strawberries 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 confectioner that you will find in my 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.990
 previous videos and three discs of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.330
 ridge in which I made small 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 holes to prevent it from swelling then one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 will start for me to put our 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.750
 baking by the technique 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 it's to reopen or another sheet 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 and a plaque and we left during 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.629
 from 10 to 12 minutes so at 180 degrees to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.629
 monitor of course 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.949
 so my ridge hosted ten minutes 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 so it's cooked properly is not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.579
 burned so we'll go to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.540
 editing so I cut my strawberries 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.009
 in 4 and I also put my cream 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.960
 pastry in a pocket then the trick 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.640
 stopped putting a little bit can be 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.080
 the pastry chef at the bottom so for 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:23.869
 maintain our yarrow then 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.869
 it may not be true layer attack 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.280
 we put our strawberries kind but a little 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.550
 little custard to maintain 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.550
 my records 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.730
 you can do the same thing with 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:02:03.210
 with raspberries or red berries 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:06.770
 red currant gooseberries so the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 last hat from above 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.370
 good it's a recipe that is very very 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.370
 quick 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.489
 here I had recovered sticks so 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.110
 to become that I had left that I was going 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.540
 I'm tired I'm actually going to be his 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.860
 disappointed part it will be pretty so the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.630
 recipe in front of a thousand leaves 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.239
 strawberries is over be creative and at 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.800
