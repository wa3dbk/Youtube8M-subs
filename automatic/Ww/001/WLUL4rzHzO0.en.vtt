00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello welcome to a comfortable in this 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.150
 I will show you how to wrap gifts 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.879
 of different shapes and sizes in this 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.930
 case I have caught a ball and two boxes of 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:24.310
 different way there are two ways to 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.180
 to do it one would be to take this extreme 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 with this 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.100
 and tie a knot 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.100
 and the same with these two 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.340
 and we would do another knot in this way we 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.960
 it would be like a cloth bag in the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 that we could put all the gifts 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.469
 together 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.839
 now I'm going to undo it to teach them 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.839
 show you the other way of doing it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.550
 it's pretty similar 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.410
 We also place the gifts in the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.410
 center 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.000
 we take this extreme and the opposite 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.000
 we make a knot 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.520
 with the left end we make another 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520
 knot 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:32.360
 and finally with the right 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.360
 we repeat the same 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.950
 It would also be another bag but another 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 way 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700
 I wrapped this package with a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.340
 scarf for the neck but what 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.110
 important is that you use a piece of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.600
 fabric or a handkerchief that has a shape 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.759
 square and that is the right size to the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.189
 gift that we are going to wrap whenever 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.840
 be bigger than the gift is 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.909
 technique of wrapping gifts with fabric 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.009
 comes from japan 'and it's called furoshiki 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.020
 and it's a way to take care of the environment 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.539
 environment since using the avoid 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.149
 use wrapping paper that in the end 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.399
 always ends up in the trash so I 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.310
 I encourage you to practice with our 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.140
 videos and that you learn to use it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.670
 I hope you liked it and do not let 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.670
