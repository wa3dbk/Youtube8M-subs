00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.220
 I still need to add some water to the filling. 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.600
 Add a little broth 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.320
 If there is no broth, I have a quick way 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.440
 There are 600g plum blossoms here. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.100
 You can also choose the side meat (also known as the second layer of meat, 僧 hat muscle, triangle meat) 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.420
 You can buy meat with pork stalls. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
 Taiwanese is called xxx 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.900
 Or two layers of meat 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.000
 No matter what method you use, it’s delicious. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.160
 The second layer of meat is not as oily as the loose meat. 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:01.520
 If you don't mind a slightly higher price, I suggest you buy a second layer of meat, very delicious. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 The second layer of meat is stirred twice into a ground meat. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.020
 Use tap water to make broth (120~150c.c water or broth) 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.060
 We can't cook well, so we use chicken powder to make it. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:30.960
 Cut the right amount of ginger into slices, cut off the onion and put it in the water. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.740
 Hey inside, called onion ginger water 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 Soak in the residue of the onion ginger water 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.420
 The more the sap of the sliced ​​onion ginger, the easier it is to release. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.080
 Soak for a while 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 This is some coriander, you can also add onions or celery, etc... very casual 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.140
 I don’t want to add broth with pure onion ginger water. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.920
 a little white pepper 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.880
 Soy sauce 2 tablespoons 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.420
 The salty part has to be tried by myself. I used 600g of ground meat, which is quite a lot. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:37.680
 It is not only possible to make dumplings, but also for pork filling. 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.580
 About 1 tsp of Thai fish sauce 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.520
 Chicken powder should be added to onion ginger water or meat. 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.320
 Chicken powder about 2 tsp 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.480
 Stir well in the same direction 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.540
 If the meat is bought in a supermarket, 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.360
 I suggest you can add some rice wine. 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.600
 I bought a fresh warm pig. 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.740
 I don’t think there is a problem with astringency, so I don’t add it. 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 First, put the meat out of the muscles, wait for the water to go in. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:39.280
 If you are not afraid of onion and ginger, you can also remove the residue and cut into fine powder. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.080
 Slowly add water 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.020
 Add a little bit of onion ginger water at a time and start stirring. 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.460
 Stirring is completed until the water is not absorbed by the meat. 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.060
 This part of the water is not as much as the water 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.820
 Because the stuffing is too wet and sticky 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.640
 Oh, because cooking time is short, it doesn't matter. 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.900
 After the mixing is completed, it should be refrigerated for 20~30min. 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.060
 Better operation 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.400
 All the water is added, about 120c.c of water 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.400
 In fact, it is still possible to add onion ginger water. 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540
 But I think it’s almost 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.640
 Meat filling ready 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.220
 Finally, mix the parsley 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.980
 Part of the spice is very casual 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.780
 I want to change to the Italian flavor. 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980
 Stir well 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.060
 The coriander is mixed with special aroma in the meat, I like it very much. 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:06.000
 So I will add coriander to the dishes that need to be stuffed. 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.140
 I really like that special aroma. 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.880
 About 1 tablespoon of sesame oil 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 Do not like it, do not add 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.040
 The filling is finished 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.400
 Refrigerated for 20~30min 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.160
 Will work better
