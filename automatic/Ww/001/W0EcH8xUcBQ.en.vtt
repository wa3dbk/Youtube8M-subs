00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.610
 the red hat has a setting is 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.320
 really sporty not just in the look 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.779
 decidedly aggressive but also e 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.670
 especially in the driving position the 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.590
 steering wheel is practically vertical like 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.290
 in racing cars and seats are 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.300
 anatomical and hold well even in the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.489
 more tight driving than helped by the way 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 really fast and steering gear and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.329
 precise 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.329
 a girl 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.309
 andrè true but it also said that 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 inside the aesthetics of the radio has 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.570
 a truly antediluvian style e 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 since I would say I find it unacceptable that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.910
 a car like this has no less 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.910
 produced in series 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.780
 rob is his Kurdish name are 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.640
 on the second you said why in the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.739
 that is, before the radio can not 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.269
 to care less because now that makes me 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 really enjoy this machine there 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.380
 music that I love is that of this boxer 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.380
 that when he goes round he sings 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.660
 yes paolo but the thing that strikes me about 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.370
 more is the delivery at lower speeds 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.900
 I didn't expect it from an aspirate 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.110
 especially after reading about some 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.050
 sites that brz really empty at the bass 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.830
 which actually has a slight hole between the 4 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.920
 and 4,500 rpm and then pulls it right up to 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.920
 background 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.270
 by now we are all used to 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.460
 turbodiesel but what could be nicer if 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.350
 don't hear the purity sing in a 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 growing endlessly like that of boxer 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.650
 aspirated a real sportsman just like 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 this of brz shot and then in consumption 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.250
 macrìmente 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.010
 this is very true and among other things it goes 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 said he also feels with hitting in the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.940
 meaning that between going strong and going 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.590
 don't worry, there aren't those jolts 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 deadly titles maybe on the turbo 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.620
 petrol 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.740
 on the other hand this is the beauty of one 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.150
 machine read a lot I was dynamic and 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.780
 especially with rear-wheel drive 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.790
 which clearly more smooth and proper 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.690
 speaking of rear-wheel drive you know 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.420
 that I want to give it to me to enjoy 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.420
 now I'm leaving points is greeting
