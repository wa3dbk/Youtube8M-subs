Starscream on a splat surface the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
Starscream on a splat surface the
missiles<00:01:27.220> should<00:01:27.970> fire<00:01:28.299> one<00:01:28.780> at<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:29.049> time

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
missiles should fire one at a time

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.880 
missiles should fire one at a time
although<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.659> depends<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.290> what<00:01:32.470> surface

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
although this depends on what surface

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.090 
although this depends on what surface
you<00:01:33.009> put<00:01:33.189> him<00:01:33.310> on<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:35.140> supposed<00:01:35.799> to<00:01:35.950> work

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
you put him on it's supposed to work

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.580 
you put him on it's supposed to work
like<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:41.460> however<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.479> very<00:01:43.600> easy<00:01:44.229> to

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
like this however it's very easy to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.969 
like this however it's very easy to
press<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.040> triggers<00:01:45.509> accidentally<00:01:46.979> leading

press the triggers accidentally leading

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.480 
press the triggers accidentally leading
to<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.250> missiles<00:01:48.729> firing<00:01:49.210> unintentionally

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
to the missiles firing unintentionally

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.940 
to the missiles firing unintentionally
this<00:01:51.490> gets<00:01:51.820> annoying<00:01:52.240> but<00:01:53.049> at<00:01:53.200> least<00:01:53.470> these

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
this gets annoying but at least these

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.210 
this gets annoying but at least these
side<00:01:54.399> pieces<00:01:54.729> can<00:01:55.720> flip<00:01:56.020> out<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.470> store<00:01:57.070> the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
side pieces can flip out and store the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.289 
side pieces can flip out and store the
missiles<00:01:57.670> aside<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:02.020> legends<00:02:02.500> version

theoretically<00:02:04.299> has<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.780> same<00:02:05.079> problems<00:02:05.680> with

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
theoretically has the same problems with

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.930 
theoretically has the same problems with
undercarriage<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.709> robot<00:02:09.220> arms<00:02:09.640> stick

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940

undercarriage but the robot arms stick
out<00:02:10.119> pretty<00:02:10.600> obviously<00:02:11.140> from<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.560> rear

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.330 
out pretty obviously from the rear
without<00:02:12.100> looking<00:02:12.640> like<00:02:12.670> anything<00:02:13.209> at<00:02:13.329> all<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
without looking like anything at all it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.890 
without looking like anything at all it
looks<00:02:15.370> decent<00:02:15.940> from<00:02:16.390> above<00:02:16.720> though<00:02:18.900> the

looks decent from above though the

looks decent from above though the
transformations<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> lot<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.370> these<00:02:21.549> movie

transformations on a lot of these movie

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.569 
transformations on a lot of these movie
figures<00:02:22.329> are<00:02:22.480> interesting<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:24.280> one

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
figures are interesting and this one

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:35.280 
figures are interesting and this one
certainly<00:02:25.030> no<00:02:25.570> exception

the<00:02:36.129> autumn<00:02:36.580> off<00:02:36.760> occurs<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.319> pull<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
the autumn off occurs when you pull the

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.569 
the autumn off occurs when you pull the
cockpit<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.170> wings<00:02:41.439> slide<00:02:42.129> up<00:02:42.340> and

cockpit up and the wings slide up and

00:02:42.579 --> 00:03:28.250 
cockpit up and the wings slide up and
apart<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.900> so

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:44.150 

the<00:03:29.260> wings<00:03:29.520> fall<00:03:30.520> down<00:03:30.850> at<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.900> back

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.949 

the<00:03:44.700> head<00:03:44.940> turns<00:03:45.570> round

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.809 

then<00:03:52.819> pull<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> arms<00:03:54.269> up<00:03:56.540> now<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.599> nosecone

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
then pull the arms up now the nosecone

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:08.839 
then pull the arms up now the nosecone
connects<00:03:59.819> to<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> back<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.950> Legends<00:04:08.459> version

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
connects to the back the Legends version

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.809 
connects to the back the Legends version
transformation<00:04:09.629> is<00:04:10.220> also<00:04:11.220> pretty

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
transformation is also pretty

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:24.270 
transformation is also pretty
interesting<00:04:12.500> albeit<00:04:13.500> simplistic

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.100 

Starscream's<00:04:25.280> robot<00:04:25.669> mode<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.210> very<00:04:26.240> movie

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
Starscream's robot mode is very movie

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.469
