00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.270
 this Hispanic culture especially in 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.250
 this country 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.220
 we no longer eat like our 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.010
 grandparents of the field began this era 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.050
 where everything is now so easy because a 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.990
 phone call and there's a pizza 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.710
 and there is this other thing and everything is 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.680
 harming people then though 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.120
 I always thought about how important 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 it was nutrition for me the important thing 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 that was eating enough fruit to eat 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.500
 enough vegetables did not have the time 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.350
 of doing that was the idea of ​​just not a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.600
 product to substitute fruits and 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.200
 vegetables for a product to add 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 to the diet of that important group that 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.090
 they are fruits and vegetables 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.980
 sometimes even though one knows that the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.950
 Good nutrition is important 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.850
 Sometimes it's not easy but with its hairs it 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.670
 put a capsule and take that and take all 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.399
 the fruit and all verdú dátolo grains and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.210
 that's the answer for health in 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.409
 anyone does not matter if 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 healthy or not healthy that's the answer and the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 pluses the solution of it and I feel that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 especially in Hispanics it is very 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 important we have to put more 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.460
 attention to our nutrition to be able 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.560
 be healthy the government is up 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 making recommendations to eat up 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 13 servings of fruits and vegetables all 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.600
 the days I do not know anyone who can 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 eat 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.270
 7 a 13 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.830
 lots of fruits and vegetables 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.360
 daily but just at least this one 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.360
 covers the right 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.450
 of that need as a pediatrician and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.740
 of more than 20 years and I think it's very 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.750
 important many times children do not 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.870
 they want they do not want to eat what they have 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.640
 that eating moms are frustrated 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.490
 but with the juz it is a very 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.870
 convenient very easy to give to the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.510
 children plus those good foods so that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.600
 make that habit that good habit of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.540
 eat well one of the things that people 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.070
 think is that it is not a vitamin 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.260
 it's vitamin is legumes and fruits that 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.580
 the fact that it is encapsulated does not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.160
 it means that you have lost your 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.040
 nutrients because the company when 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.260
 they use the process is at a very temperature 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.540
 low and so the product does not lose in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.380
 nutrition the company has a commitment 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.710
 of quality to have control over 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.020
 our product from the point where 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.000
 the product grows in the field the 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.940
 main difference is 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.830
 fruits and vegetables that are sold in the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.710
 supermarkets have had to be 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.770
 cut with much anticipation then 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.650
 we have not allowed that fruit or 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.320
 that vegetable see developing his 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.530
 nutritional potential has had been 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.780
 cut very green still in the case of 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.600
 the ingredients that we use for them 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.900
 Well, since we already have a contract with the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.970
 farmer he does not have that problem anymore 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.980
 true to say where I'm going to sell 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.680
 Our product can then leave it 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.290
 in the field until it is mature and 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.739
 cut it at the precise moment where 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.170
 will have the best nutritional density 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.980
 fruits and vegetables are passed by 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.860
 a processor that extracts the juice and then 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.220
 that juice stays very cold until 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.350
 go through a dryer then the dryer 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.290
 adds no more heat enough for 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.110
 Dry the product to make it powder 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.689
 and in that way it 's a pretty process 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.760
 fast that way we can achieve 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.680
 have a product where it is maintained 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.780
 most of the nutrients that 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.150
 They came from the fruit and vegetable original 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.009
 but the most wonderful thing that has its 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.019
 pros is the clinical studies that what 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.940
 they support that although I do not see what 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.039
 is doing inside my body the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.169
 recommendations that doctors make to 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.470
 his patients are based on science 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.530
 So far there are 20 investigations that 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.220
 have been done in institutions here in 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.860
 us in europe in australia where it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.229
 has observed the effect that the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.229
 product then it has been discovered that 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.630
 the product is digested is absorbed by 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.270
 the body perfectly and it has 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.910
 found also that all those 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.680
 nutrients that come in the product are 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.180
 he finds in the blood what he wants 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.550
 say that the body is absorbing them 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.350
 very well 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.240
 that's the main difference there 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.200
 between your blogs and everyone else 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.860

 take it and this has become a 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.880
 part of our daily routine is what 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.220
 first we take a glass in the morning

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.890
 if I ate a couple of vegetables at a

 person who now asks me to vegetables all 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.600
 the days are what we eat then 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.520
