fire<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.329> why<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
fire that's you know why I think and the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819 
fire that's you know why I think and the
next<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.210> actually<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> last<00:01:52.409> two<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> the

next to actually the last two on the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.160 
next to actually the last two on the
improvement<00:01:53.369> side<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:54.450> both<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
improvement side are both to do with

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.190 
improvement side are both to do with
king<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> hill<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> first<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
king of the hill so the first one is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.719 
king of the hill so the first one is
ring<00:01:57.350> locators<00:01:57.890> are<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.130> visible<00:01:58.490> and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
spectator mode so obviously before the

spectator mode so obviously before the
update<00:02:01.490> they<00:02:01.820> weren't<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:03.280> some<00:02:04.280> Hill

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
update they weren't and some Hill

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.179 
update they weren't and some Hill
locations<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.210> been<00:02:05.270> adjusted<00:02:06.039> what<00:02:07.039> that

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
locations have been adjusted what that

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.300 
locations have been adjusted what that
means<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.720> hills<00:02:09.259> around<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.920> maps<00:02:10.129> have

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
means is the hills around the maps have

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.400 
means is the hills around the maps have
been<00:02:10.489> moved<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.120> different<00:02:11.300> locations<00:02:11.599> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
been moved to different locations and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.710 
been moved to different locations and

certain maps and the next thing I'm

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.790 
certain maps and the next thing I'm
going<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.760> talk<00:02:19.910> about<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> bug<00:02:20.959> fixes<00:02:21.440> in

going to talk about is the bug fixes in

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.640 
going to talk about is the bug fixes in
Gears<00:02:22.250> all<00:02:22.400> three<00:02:22.819> these<00:02:23.599> are<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.170> fixes<00:02:24.530> that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
Gears all three these are the fixes that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.380 
Gears all three these are the fixes that
they're<00:02:24.830> doing<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.280> tight<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.060> porch

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
they're doing in tight what they porch

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the progression screen yeah as I said

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.039 
the progression screen yeah as I said
before<00:02:55.099> that<00:02:55.910> doesn't<00:02:56.299> really<00:02:56.390> occur<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.780> me

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
before that doesn't really occur to me

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.990 
before that doesn't really occur to me
and<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.260> lot<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.470> people<00:02:57.560> because<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.880> know

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
hordes not a very popular thing on

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.340 
hordes not a very popular thing on
youtube<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.549> guess<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.900> next<00:03:03.079> thing<00:03:03.230> is

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
youtube I guess the next thing is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.400 
youtube I guess the next thing is
chainsaw<00:03:04.130> audio<00:03:04.609> loop<00:03:04.880> well<00:03:05.269> now<00:03:05.750> persist<00:03:06.200> for

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
chainsaw audio loop well now persist for

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.110 
chainsaw audio loop well now persist for

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
listeners who leave the audio full range

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.870 
listeners who leave the audio full range
and<00:03:08.470> re-enter<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.650> that's<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.519> annoying

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
and re-enter it that's really annoying

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.190 
and re-enter it that's really annoying
you<00:03:11.239> know<00:03:11.269> if<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.569> kill<00:03:11.780> someone<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.170> a

won't<00:03:36.560> get<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.829> points<00:03:37.190> for<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.639> know<00:03:37.670> I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
won't get the points for it you know I

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.230 
won't get the points for it you know I
think

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
think

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.050 
think
they<00:03:39.050> remove<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.730> won't<00:03:40.940> be

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
they remove that now so that won't be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.180 
they remove that now so that won't be
happening<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:42.320> next<00:03:42.620> thing<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.160> a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
happening the next thing this is a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.040 
happening the next thing this is a
pretty<00:03:43.520> big<00:03:43.790> thing<00:03:44.060> for<00:03:44.090> when<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.600> servers

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
pretty big thing for when the servers

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.620 
pretty big thing for when the servers
are<00:03:45.080> down<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.250> cocked<00:03:46.490> pistol<00:03:46.700> firing<00:03:47.240> rate

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
are down the cocked pistol firing rate

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.750 
are down the cocked pistol firing rate
has<00:03:47.840> been<00:03:47.870> adjusted<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.740> equal<00:03:49.190> on<00:03:49.430> host

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
has been adjusted to be equal on host

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.900 
has been adjusted to be equal on host
and<00:03:50.030> clients<00:03:50.630> what<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.800> means<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.430> when

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
and clients what that means is when

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.180 
and clients what that means is when
you're<00:03:53.060> playing<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.540> host<00:03:53.780> your<00:03:54.530> pistol<00:03:54.980> fire

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
you're playing on host your pistol fire

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.580 
you're playing on host your pistol fire
rate<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> lot<00:03:56.000> more<00:03:56.180> faster<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.020> your

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
rate is a lot more faster and your

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.040 
rate is a lot more faster and your
bullets<00:03:58.010> do<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> lot<00:03:58.430> more<00:03:58.460> damage<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.390> now

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
bullets do a lot more damage so now

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.830 
bullets do a lot more damage so now
they've<00:04:00.380> made<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.740> host<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.100> clients<00:04:01.580> even

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
they've made the host and clients even

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.960 
they've made the host and clients even
which<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.140> very<00:04:03.710> helpful<00:04:04.070> if<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.430> servers
