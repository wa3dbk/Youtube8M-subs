00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:47.710 

I<00:01:44.240> would<00:01:45.240> classify<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.870> as

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
I would classify it as

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.580 
I would classify it as
intermediate-to-advanced<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.960> that's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
intermediate-to-advanced and that's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
intermediate-to-advanced and that's
because<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.010> has<00:01:51.230> counterpoint<00:01:52.230> all<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.530> way

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because it has counterpoint all the way

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.890 
because it has counterpoint all the way
through<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.010> two<00:01:53.280> separate<00:01:53.850> voices<00:01:54.120> and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
through it has two separate voices and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.440 
through it has two separate voices and
as<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.150> look<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
as you can see when you look at the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.260 
as you can see when you look at the
music<00:01:57.680> you've<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.400> you've<00:01:59.730> got<00:01:59.760> these

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
music you've got the you've got these

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 
music you've got the you've got these
two<00:02:00.980> melodic<00:02:01.980> voices<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.550> are<00:02:02.610> working<00:02:02.880> with

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
two melodic voices that are working with

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.540 
two melodic voices that are working with
each<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.780> you've<00:02:04.260> got<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> famous<00:02:05.070> melody

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
each other you've got the famous melody

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.140 
each other you've got the famous melody
that<00:02:05.850> everyone<00:02:06.150> recognizes<00:02:10.820> but<00:02:11.820> you've<00:02:11.970> also

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
that everyone recognizes but you've also

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.660 
that everyone recognizes but you've also
got<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.810> bass<00:02:13.260> line<00:02:13.500> down<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.670> these

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
got this bass line down here and these

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.390 
got this bass line down here and these
two<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:21.030> always<00:02:21.480> working<00:02:22.260> together

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.420 

and<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.780> means<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.230> your<00:02:30.470> hand<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.400> left

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
and that means that your hand your left

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.809 
and that means that your hand your left
hand<00:02:31.879> especially<00:02:32.260> has<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.470> go<00:02:33.620> through<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.280> lot

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
hand especially has to go through a lot

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.619 
hand especially has to go through a lot
of<00:02:34.849> acrobatics<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.819> always<00:02:37.819> get<00:02:38.269> both<00:02:38.599> of

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
of acrobatics to always get both of

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.780 
of acrobatics to always get both of
those<00:02:38.930> voices<00:02:39.260> happening<00:02:40.129> at<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.549> same<00:02:40.730> time

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
those voices happening at the same time

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.430 
those voices happening at the same time
and<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.819> where<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.629> difficulty<00:02:45.049> comes

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and this is where the difficulty comes

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.289 
and this is where the difficulty comes
in<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.970> teaching<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.780> piece<00:02:48.909> what<00:02:49.909> I<00:02:49.940> want

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
in so in teaching this piece what I want

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.729 
in so in teaching this piece what I want
to<00:02:50.390> stress<00:02:50.599> is<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.810> possible<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.530> learn

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
to stress is that it's possible to learn

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.100 
to stress is that it's possible to learn
if<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:56.329> really<00:02:56.840> carefully<00:02:57.620> learn<00:02:58.480> each<00:02:59.480> one

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
if you really carefully learn each one

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.420 
if you really carefully learn each one
of<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.099> each<00:03:01.510> set<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.750> voices<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.310> you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
of the each set of voices so if you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.599 
of the each set of voices so if you
learn<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.870> G<00:03:06.319> on<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.769> sixth<00:03:07.099> string<00:03:07.400> and

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
learn this G on the sixth string and

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.789 
learn this G on the sixth string and
then<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.790> learn<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.510> e<00:03:08.620> opening<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
then you learn the e opening on the

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.009 
then you learn the e opening on the
first<00:03:10.010> string<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.569> think<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.840> that

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
first string and you just think of that

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.860 
first string and you just think of that
as<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> unit<00:03:12.799> it's<00:03:12.920> almost<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.579> chord<00:03:13.970> it's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
as a unit it's almost like a chord it's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.490 
as a unit it's almost like a chord it's
a<00:03:14.989> two<00:03:15.200> note<00:03:15.440> chord<00:03:15.829> actually<00:03:17.109> we<00:03:18.109> call<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
a two note chord actually we call it a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.819 
a two note chord actually we call it a
dyad<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.190> classical<00:03:19.730> terms<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:21.620> this

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
dyad in classical terms and then this

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.970 
dyad in classical terms and then this
one<00:03:23.019> another<00:03:24.019> tune<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.409> chord<00:03:24.680> it's<00:03:24.859> an

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
one another tune up chord it's an

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.309 
one another tune up chord it's an
f-sharp<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.299> sixth<00:03:26.599> string<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.200> an

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
f-sharp on the sixth string and an

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.630 
f-sharp on the sixth string and an
f-sharp<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.400> first<00:03:28.609> string<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.299> then

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
f-sharp on the first string and then

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.240 
f-sharp on the first string and then
this<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.909> where<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.530> notes<00:03:33.739> switch

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
this one where the the notes switch

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.250 
this one where the the notes switch
around<00:03:34.609> on<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.239> sixth<00:03:35.569> string<00:03:35.780> now<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.019> have

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
around on the sixth string now you have

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.319 
around on the sixth string now you have
an<00:03:36.349> E<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.799> on<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.609> first<00:03:37.819> string<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.239> a

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
an E and on the first string you have a

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.400 
an E and on the first string you have a
G<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.269> space<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.540> those<00:03:41.989> first

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
G so just in the space of those first

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.839 
G so just in the space of those first
three<00:03:43.299> eighth<00:03:44.299> note<00:03:44.690> beads<00:03:45.049> you've<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:46.310> three

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
three eighth note beads you've got three

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.180 
three eighth note beads you've got three
chords<00:03:47.569> that<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.109> learn<00:03:48.349> now<00:03:48.709> there's<00:03:48.919> simple

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
chords that you learn now there's simple

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.210 
chords that you learn now there's simple
chords<00:03:49.690> any<00:03:50.690> individual<00:03:51.500> chord<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:52.010> this

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
chords any individual chord in this

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.879 
chords any individual chord in this
piece<00:03:52.459> is<00:03:52.730> actually<00:03:53.079> kind<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.230> super<00:03:54.739> easy

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
piece is actually kind of super easy

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.059 
piece is actually kind of super easy
because<00:03:55.160> they<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.609> two<00:03:55.790> notes<00:03:57.069> that

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
because they just have two notes that

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.789 
because they just have two notes that
one<00:03:58.629> that<00:03:59.629> one<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.139> that<00:04:01.359> one<00:04:02.359> and<00:04:02.709> even<00:04:03.709> the

one that one and that one and even the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.210 
one that one and that one and even the
bar<00:04:04.269> in<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.690> lot<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.840> places<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.290> bar<00:04:06.709> chord<00:04:06.980> is

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
bar in a lot of places a bar chord is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.449 
bar in a lot of places a bar chord is
not<00:04:07.879> that<00:04:08.180> hard<00:04:08.419> because<00:04:08.569> all<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.139> doing

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
not that hard because all you're doing

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.050 
not that hard because all you're doing
is<00:04:10.810> making<00:04:11.810> sure<00:04:12.049> that<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.530> get<00:04:12.680> two<00:04:12.919> notes<00:04:13.160> so

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
is making sure that you get two notes so

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
is making sure that you get two notes so
I'm<00:04:14.329> just<00:04:14.569> making<00:04:14.720> sure<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.039> get<00:04:16.190> the

first the first string note with this
part<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.030> my<00:04:20.209> bar<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.229> I'm<00:04:21.590> making<00:04:21.709> sure<00:04:21.949> I<00:04:21.979> get

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
part of my bar and I'm making sure I get

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.129 
part of my bar and I'm making sure I get
the<00:04:22.250> sixth<00:04:22.550> string<00:04:22.760> note<00:04:22.970> with<00:04:23.180> this<00:04:23.840> part<00:04:24.080> of

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
the sixth string note with this part of

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.800 
the sixth string note with this part of
the<00:04:24.199> bar<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.479> doesn't<00:04:26.810> even<00:04:26.930> matter<00:04:27.320> if

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
the bar and it doesn't even matter if

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.610 
the bar and it doesn't even matter if
the<00:04:29.810> rest<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.229> them<00:04:30.400> are<00:04:31.400> clear<00:04:31.990> notice<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.320> I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
the rest of them are clear notice that I

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.190 
the rest of them are clear notice that I
could<00:04:34.580> press<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.000> bar<00:04:35.150> down

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
could press the bar down

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.040 
could press the bar down
and<00:04:37.010> all<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.340> them<00:04:37.460> would<00:04:37.550> be<00:04:37.700> clear<00:04:38.050> that

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
and all of them would be clear that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.850 
and all of them would be clear that
would<00:04:39.170> take<00:04:39.350> more<00:04:39.530> strength<00:04:39.770> but<00:04:41.770> just<00:04:42.770> how

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
would take more strength but just how

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.780 
would take more strength but just how
those<00:04:43.070> middle<00:04:43.460> notes<00:04:45.100> aren't<00:04:46.100> not<00:04:46.520> even

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
those middle notes aren't not even

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.100 
those middle notes aren't not even
needed<00:04:47.120> so<00:04:49.270> this<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.390> why<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.510> say<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
needed so this is why I say that the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.480 
needed so this is why I say that the
piece<00:04:51.290> is<00:04:51.500> actually<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.950> little<00:04:52.040> bit<00:04:52.130> easier

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
piece is actually a little bit easier

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.270 
piece is actually a little bit easier
than<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.820> would<00:04:52.850> think<00:04:53.000> but<00:04:53.690> since<00:04:54.620> there<00:04:55.130> are

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
than you would think but since there are

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820 
than you would think but since there are
so<00:04:55.490> many<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.820> these<00:04:55.940> you've<00:04:56.420> got<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.720> slow<00:04:57.560> down

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
so many of these you've got to slow down

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.580 
so many of these you've got to slow down
and<00:04:58.190> learn<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.270> bit<00:04:59.480> by<00:04:59.510> bit<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.110> that's<00:05:00.470> what

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
and learn it bit by bit and that's what

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.340 
and learn it bit by bit and that's what
I'm<00:05:00.650> going<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.800> be<00:05:00.890> teaching<00:05:01.010> you
