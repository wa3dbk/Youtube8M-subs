00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
kind of did you know he kept the car
down<00:02:24.360> there<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.260> didn't<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> see

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
down there so I didn't really get to see

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.670 
down there so I didn't really get to see
a<00:02:26.640> lot<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.480> happening<00:02:27.930> down<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
a lot of it happening down there and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.650 
a lot of it happening down there and
he'd<00:02:28.830> show<00:02:29.099> me<00:02:29.129> pictures<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.940> videos<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
he'd show me pictures and videos and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.790 
he'd show me pictures and videos and
what<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:30.930> were<00:02:30.989> doing<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.379> stuff<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
what they were doing and stuff like that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.940 
what they were doing and stuff like that
and<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.790> did<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.360> an<00:02:33.450> awesome<00:02:33.599> job

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
and they did really do an awesome job

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.920 
and they did really do an awesome job
but<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> took<00:02:35.220> forever<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> think<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.810> was

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
but it took forever so I think it was

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.320 
but it took forever so I think it was
down<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.349> for<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.650> four<00:02:37.950> years<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:39.180> he

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
down there for like four years then he

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.690 
down there for like four years then he
sent<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.750> back<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.379> after<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.890> paint<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
sent it back up here after the paint and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.570 
sent it back up here after the paint and
the<00:02:41.780> dash<00:02:42.780> were<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.770> frame<00:02:44.190> was<00:02:44.400> all
