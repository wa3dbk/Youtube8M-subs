00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 I'm sorry I'm here with you with a 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 new video this time I'm going to 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.599
 share three infallible recipes that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.420
 I have tried myself to combat 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 fat on the scalp and or 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 I usually have the scalp 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 arm but my hair from ends to ends 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 it's not from normal to dry because of the dyes 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 for climates and so on but if I suffer 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
 that suddenly I get fat in the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.760
 Scalp a little more than normal 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.190
 It's not excessive but if you have the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.219
 problem that is very very fatty you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.410
 hair this can also work for you 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.590
 obviously you will do it more often 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 so I have three recipes for you 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 very good that surely they are not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.510
 nothing expensive and that surely some 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 of the ingredients you already have in your 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 good home the first kind the first 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 recipe to control excess fat 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.400
 in the scalp is based on two 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.880
 ingredients that you surely have and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.770
 yes 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.770
 It will be very easy to get 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.070
 the first one is this water from 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.430
 witch hazel that I have already shown them in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.740
 some of my videos that I use it 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.100
 to control the excess fat in my 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.150
 face for that serves this water is a 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.430
 extra huge and why not use it in 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 the hair has the same function 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.700
 it also controls the fat but we're going to 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.770
 make a combination of this water of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.410
 melis with mouthwash can be the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 Mouthwash you have at home 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.870
 it matters the water of witch hazel you can 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.370
 find in me this I bought it in a goal 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.310
 more in the area where are the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.340
 alcohol the alcohol the poured beats all 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.760
 that kind of little band things there I found 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.520
 this is witch hazel 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.770
 and well the mouthwash in 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.260
 anywhere you can find it as 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.240
 let's do this preparation is very 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.850
 very easy we are going to put the same 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.820
 amount of mameli water and the same 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.770
 amount of mouthwash this 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 we will only apply it in the colo 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.170
 scalp then it is not necessary that 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 do a lot of me normally 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.530
 used this container I put this 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.750
 trickle that is at most average 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.750
 spoonful and I put the same amount 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.990
 mix very well 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.880
 that they mix very well the two as a 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.490
 cotton disk especially of these 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.200
 that do not tear 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.040
 we re-prepare it in the preparation 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 we squeeze very very well 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.940
 and what I 'm going to do after taking a bath 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.760
 It can be with dry hair with 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 Wet hair like you prefer I'll 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.140
 put it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.150
 the scalp in everything in all my 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.150
 scalp for 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.320
 and this will help me control the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.120
 fat that comes out of this the truth is that 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.780
 well with this I'm perfect for 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.410
 the whole head and the truth as I 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.040
 I comment I have a fatty scalp 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.650
 but it's not excessive this I already do two 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.680
 times a week but if you have to 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.110
 place helped too fatty you can 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.460
 do it every third day the truth this 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.350
 remedy was very very fresh and very fresh 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.760
 the scalp then crazy feels 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.860
 that freshness does not irritate this I have already 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.630
 checked I hope that in your case 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.480
 work the same if in a moment 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.760
 you feel some irritation 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.590
 Well, it uses only water from 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.340
 witch hazel with the same shape with a 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.050
 cotton in what is the scalp 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.210
 we go with the second type and good the 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.700
 next recipe has a lot to do with 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.440
 a product so surely if 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.620
 you follow my videos and that of other girls 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 of makeup you know that it is essential to 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.810
 control the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.330
 of fat on the face and this is milk 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.610
 of magnesia 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.879
 but we can also give him a soup of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.860
 hair is like that and good sounds logical if 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.659
 this helps us control the excess 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.819
 fat in the skin because it's not going to 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.639
 help control excess fat in 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.069
 the scalp 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.310
 how are we going to use it, let's add 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:47.159
 to our shampoo a spoonful of the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.860
 magnesia milk for every 250 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.880
 milliliters that contains our shampoo 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.700
 let's put a tablespoon 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.510
 in this case I have this meter that is 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.520
 of 15 milliliters or you can measure it with 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.960
 this one with which we normally eat 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.650
 we eat the soup 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.610
 let's shake very very well 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.669
 our milk of magnesia 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.639
 so that it fits perfectly and 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.639
 remember for every 250 milliliters that 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.310
 contain your shampoo let's put a 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.729
 tablespoon milk of magnesia mine 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.830
 has 350 milliliters then I'm going to 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.830
 put a tablespoon and quarter 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:42.490
 and now simply the emptiness 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.490
 Shampoo me it is I got there I had enough 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.270
 and so we are perfectly and good and 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.910
 is ready ready our shampoo for 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.430
 control the excess fat of our 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.220
 scalp this obviously so what 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.200
 let's use good newspaper 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.240
 daily 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.850
 every time I'm going to use it, I have to 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.040
 shake it very well and I wash the 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.800
 hair as normally there is no 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.860
 I receive white not much less because 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.780
 good to rinse it out everything but if the 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.000
 truth is that I have noticed that it controls me 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.110
 a lot of excess fat and good the 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.600
 third recipe is very simple to make 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.320
 let's get mint whether it's fresh 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.210
 is has put it to follow in the 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.270
 supermarket or you can get it dry 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.760
 in the places in the markets 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.870
 where herbs are sold aromatic plants 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.240
 and all that we're going to take 2 fists in 2 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.630
 cups of water and we're going to put 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.050
 boil the let's cool the cabbage 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.030
 masters and with that twine when we get 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.640
 to bathe and we have already saved the 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.810
 same hair and we already use this 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.810
 has the milk of magnesia 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.539
 let's rinse our hair and for 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.139
 last to remove all the shampoo and 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:08.750
 finally we are going to empty that infusion 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:11.599
 of mint that we have with that we are going to 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.520
 to finish the bath we dry very well the 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:18.530
 hair and that will also help us 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.990
 enough to control the fat in the 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.870
 scalp I hope these 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.060
 tricks have been very useful and 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.370
 well I say goodbye I hope you are very 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.000
 well and see you in the next video 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.000
 bye
