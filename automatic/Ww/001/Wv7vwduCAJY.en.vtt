testing it out and yeah I thought I was

testing it out and yeah I thought I was
good<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> obviously<00:01:34.829> went<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.130> out

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
good to go and obviously went back out

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
good to go and obviously went back out
there<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.579> try<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> wasn't<00:01:36.150> till<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
there and try it wasn't till I really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
there and try it wasn't till I really
caught<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> ball<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> pivoted<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.579> left

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
caught the ball and pivoted on that left

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.020 
caught the ball and pivoted on that left
leg

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
leg

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.140 
leg
felt<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.200> fall<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.250> yeah

felt like I was gonna fall over and yeah
I<00:01:42.210> realized<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.290> wasn't<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.220> guess

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
little bit of trepidation because I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
little bit of trepidation because I
hadn't<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:07.170> had<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> feeling<00:02:07.799> before

hadn't really had that feeling before

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.110 
hadn't really had that feeling before
but<00:02:09.000> hoping<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.569> could<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.750> run<00:02:10.110> through<00:02:10.289> it

but hoping I could just run through it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.850 
but hoping I could just run through it
I<00:02:11.150> heard<00:02:11.810> graphic<00:02:12.260> say<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.590> she<00:02:12.739> was

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.949 
I heard graphic say that she was
screaming<00:02:13.730> at<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> laptop<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.569> are<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.780> and

screaming at the laptop that are you and
you<00:02:15.050> came<00:02:15.560> back<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.459> what's<00:02:16.940> been

you came back on you know what's been
the<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.840> dialogue<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.590> guess<00:02:18.800> with<00:02:19.010> graphy

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
the the dialogue I guess with graphy

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.220 
the the dialogue I guess with graphy
since<00:02:19.580> he<00:02:19.670> did<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.090> through<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.599> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
since he did it and through that that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.630 
since he did it and through that that
whole<00:02:21.410> situation<00:02:21.769> where<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.489> bad

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
whole situation where you got the bad

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.089 
whole situation where you got the bad
news<00:02:24.550> trying<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.730> sure<00:02:26.739> once<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.860> cooled

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
news trying to be sure once I cooled

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.440 
news trying to be sure once I cooled
down<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.310> realized<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.879> was<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.299> more

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
down I realized it was a little more

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.050 
down I realized it was a little more
serious<00:02:29.840> than<00:02:29.870> I'd<00:02:30.110> first<00:02:30.379> thought<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.060> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
serious than I'd first thought and you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.759 
serious than I'd first thought and you
know<00:02:32.180> she<00:02:32.239> was<00:02:32.599> obviously<00:02:33.140> letting<00:02:33.650> me<00:02:33.739> know

know she was obviously letting me know
that<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.489> probably<00:02:34.940> shouldn't<00:02:35.269> have<00:02:35.420> gone<00:02:35.540> back

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
that I probably shouldn't have gone back

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.259 
that I probably shouldn't have gone back
on<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.769> second<00:02:37.160> time<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:37.489> look<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.239> know

something to sort of you know said to be

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.460 
something to sort of you know said to be
more<00:03:59.180> than<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.359> little<00:03:59.419> bit<00:03:59.720> but<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.440> know

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
more than a little bit but you know

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.099 
more than a little bit but you know
that's<00:04:00.769> that's<00:04:01.130> fair<00:04:01.400> enough<00:04:01.780> looking<00:04:02.780> at<00:04:02.989> I

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
that's that's fair enough looking at I

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.140 
that's that's fair enough looking at I
guess<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.859> size<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> apples<00:04:04.790> team<00:04:05.000> this

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
guess the size of the apples team this

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.159 
guess the size of the apples team this
year

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
year

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.460 
year
you<00:04:06.739> know<00:04:06.859> it's<00:04:07.099> Suzy<00:04:07.549> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
you know it's Suzy and

please and Jenna and Abbi and all those
sorts<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.750> players<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:12.040> probably<00:04:12.310> an<00:04:13.090> asset

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
sorts of players it's probably an asset

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.020 
sorts of players it's probably an asset
that<00:04:13.510> he<00:04:13.840> must<00:04:13.960> have<00:04:14.080> had<00:04:14.320> before<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:15.790> know<00:04:15.820> is

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
that he must have had before you know is

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.970 
that he must have had before you know is
that<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.450> be<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.470> those<00:04:17.590> strengths

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
that going to be one of those strengths

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.229 
that going to be one of those strengths
going<00:04:18.160> into<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.430> tournament<00:04:18.640> particularly

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
going into the tournament particularly

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.060 
going into the tournament particularly
playing<00:04:19.450> against<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.750> team<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.200> USA<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
playing against a team like the USA the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.440 
playing against a team like the USA the
the<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> amount<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.700> size<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.300> their

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
the the amount of size and their

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.690 
the the amount of size and their
abilities<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.930> guess<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.230> own<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.040> glass<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.640> a

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
abilities I guess to own the glass and a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.490 
abilities I guess to own the glass and a
lot<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:24.880> games<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.450> mean<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> size<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.410> the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
lot of games I mean the size and the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
lot of games I mean the size and the
strength<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:27.010> something<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.460> to

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
strength is something you have to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.490 
strength is something you have to
address<00:04:27.880> obviously<00:04:28.510> with<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.720> US<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.230> mean<00:04:29.380> in

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
address obviously with the US I mean in

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.360 
address obviously with the US I mean in
every<00:04:29.620> position<00:04:29.980> they<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:31.320> athletic<00:04:32.370> strong

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
every position they have athletic strong

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.660 
every position they have athletic strong

that<00:07:21.050> you<00:07:21.470> know<00:07:21.590> did<00:07:22.070> the<00:07:22.160> proper<00:07:22.400> rehab<00:07:22.730> now

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
that you know did the proper rehab now

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.950 
that you know did the proper rehab now
and<00:07:23.180> you're<00:07:23.270> there's<00:07:23.450> still<00:07:23.630> time<00:07:23.810> for

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
and you're there's still time for

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.770 
and you're there's still time for
another<00:07:24.080> Olympics<00:07:24.560> in<00:07:24.680> another<00:07:24.890> crack<00:07:25.490> it

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
another Olympics in another crack it

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.670 
another Olympics in another crack it
potentially<00:07:26.780> got<00:07:26.960> a<00:07:26.990> medal<00:07:29.260> looks<00:07:30.260> that<00:07:30.440> far

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
potentially got a medal looks that far

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.470 
potentially got a medal looks that far
ahead<00:07:30.770> I<00:07:31.160> definitely<00:07:31.550> think<00:07:31.730> that<00:07:31.850> if<00:07:32.120> I<00:07:32.270> am

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:32.480 
ahead I definitely think that if I am

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.020 
ahead I definitely think that if I am
playing<00:07:32.810> at<00:07:33.050> this<00:07:33.170> level<00:07:33.340> well<00:07:34.340> that<00:07:34.490> I<00:07:34.520> was<00:07:34.730> a

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030 
playing at this level well that I was a

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.430 
playing at this level well that I was a
couple<00:07:35.240> of<00:07:35.390> weeks<00:07:35.570> ago<00:07:35.750> then<00:07:36.140> I<00:07:36.320> would

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
couple of weeks ago then I would

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.570 
couple of weeks ago then I would
definitely<00:07:36.700> make<00:07:37.700> myself<00:07:37.910> a<00:07:38.180> part<00:07:38.420> of<00:07:38.480> it<00:07:38.660> and

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
definitely make myself a part of it and

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.460 
definitely make myself a part of it and
you<00:07:40.580> know<00:07:40.700> if<00:07:40.880> I'm<00:07:41.060> not<00:07:41.090> then<00:07:41.540> then<00:07:42.080> you<00:07:42.380> know

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.470 
you know if I'm not then then you know

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.050 
you know if I'm not then then you know
maybe<00:07:42.650> it's<00:07:42.890> time<00:07:42.920> for<00:07:43.280> the<00:07:43.370> next<00:07:43.490> sort<00:07:44.030> of

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.060 
maybe it's time for the next sort of

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.600 
maybe it's time for the next sort of
generation<00:07:44.660> and<00:07:44.930> their<00:07:45.050> turn<00:07:45.260> but<00:07:45.560> but<00:07:46.490> look

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
generation and their turn but but look

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.010 
generation and their turn but but look
that'll<00:07:46.940> be<00:07:47.030> something<00:07:47.390> that'll<00:07:47.510> sort<00:07:47.750> itself

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
that'll be something that'll sort itself

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.080 
that'll be something that'll sort itself
out<00:07:48.260> definitely<00:07:48.560> I<00:07:48.800> think<00:07:48.890> that<00:07:49.280> this<00:07:49.490> injury

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090 
out definitely I think that this injury

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.810 
out definitely I think that this injury
as<00:07:50.690> disappointing<00:07:51.500> as<00:07:51.590> it<00:07:51.740> is<00:07:51.860> may<00:07:52.100> give<00:07:52.340> me<00:07:52.520> a

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:52.820 
as disappointing as it is may give me a

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.730 
as disappointing as it is may give me a
little<00:07:53.210> bit<00:07:53.420> more<00:07:53.600> time<00:07:53.840> on<00:07:54.110> the<00:07:54.200> end<00:07:54.440> of<00:07:54.590> my

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:54.740 
little bit more time on the end of my

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.450 
little bit more time on the end of my
career<00:07:56.200> but<00:07:57.200> yeah<00:07:57.380> we'll<00:07:57.650> have<00:07:57.800> to<00:07:57.920> see<00:07:58.130> I<00:07:58.160> mean

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:58.460 
career but yeah we'll have to see I mean

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.610 
career but yeah we'll have to see I mean
they<00:07:59.270> say<00:07:59.480> women<00:07:59.660> peak<00:07:59.990> later<00:08:00.230> in<00:08:00.470> their

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.620 
they say women peak later in their

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.800 
they say women peak later in their
career<00:08:00.890> so<00:08:01.190> I'm<00:08:01.700> hoping<00:08:02.030> that's<00:08:02.180> the<00:08:02.330> case<00:08:02.570> and

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:02.810 
career so I'm hoping that's the case and

career so I'm hoping that's the case and
I've<00:08:02.930> got<00:08:03.110> a<00:08:03.140> few<00:08:03.350> more<00:08:03.470> to<00:08:03.620> go
