 Ha sumi blows out the candles 

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.161
 Our Ha Som is already 4 years old 

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:13.329
 You'll go to daycare next year 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.601

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.412
 She is not old enough for that today 

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:19.735
 When will I be able to get married? 

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.688

 Dad, my feet are sparkling 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.686
 Stars? Ã©tincellantes? 

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.635
 Hey, she says her feet are numb 

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:40.968

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.448

 Oh, our Ha Som is rich today 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.035

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.006
 Ha Som opens the first one, the first of my favorites 

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.860
 I want to open that of the pretty lady 

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.035
 Ha Som, the biggest are the most annoying 

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:04.085

 Ha Som, open the rest of the gifts before 

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.935
