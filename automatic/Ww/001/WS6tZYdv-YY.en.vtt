the operative times in my experience are

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
the operative times in my experience are
actually<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.400> shorter<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.600> anytime<00:00:25.109> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
actually a little shorter so anytime we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.170 
actually a little shorter so anytime we
can<00:00:25.590> shorten<00:00:26.010> an<00:00:26.099> operation<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:27.060> it

can shorten an operation and do it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.460 
can shorten an operation and do it
safely<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.599> think<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:27.960> better<00:00:28.140> less

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
safely I think that's better less

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
safely I think that's better less
anesthesia<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.189> less<00:00:29.310> operative<00:00:29.640> time<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
anesthesia or less operative time is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.350 
anesthesia or less operative time is
always<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.539> desirable<00:00:31.349> thing<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.090> smaller

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
always a desirable thing the the smaller

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
always a desirable thing the the smaller
incision<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> also<00:00:34.380> less<00:00:35.250> painful<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
incision I think is also less painful it
doesn't<00:00:36.210> completely<00:00:36.570> divide<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> sternum<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
doesn't completely divide the sternum so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
doesn't completely divide the sternum so
there's<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.579> pain<00:00:38.820> associated<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there's not as much pain associated and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410 
there's not as much pain associated and
and<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.550> pulmonary<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.700> lung<00:00:41.969> related

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.229 
and also pulmonary or lung related
complications<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.469> less<00:00:44.239> located

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
