and put a squirt of venom into there

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.940 
and put a squirt of venom into there
it'll<00:01:42.939> turn<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.420> blood<00:01:43.630> into<00:01:43.869> jelly<00:01:44.110> now

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.859 
varying species and in fact we look
closely<00:01:51.729> enough<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.270> almost<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.659> some

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869

gives it a typical name of tiger snake

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.219 
gives it a typical name of tiger snake
it's<00:01:58.179> going<00:01:58.390> pretty<00:01:58.539> cool<00:01:58.899> so<00:01:59.049> what<00:01:59.140> we're

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
it's going pretty cool so what we're
