00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.310
 Hello there in this video do not act tutorial Beulich you can 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.149
 So get off again 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.710
 We would not have something at least as interesting for you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.450
 so in, sit back 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.820
 and let your style computer Orior paired with a bit of irony on you 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.220
 be few 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.980
 we are writing the year 1965 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.640
 For once, the world may not be right in a world war 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.550
 well only the Anifer the Russians can not really suffer the carpenters 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.620
 the cold war is in full swing 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.920
 and in the action, how to think about the rest of the world 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 Once again, the terribly clever idea can convince each other 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.760
 exchange 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.390
 but at the same time, more and more research is going on my way technically 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.540
 stay with the other 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 and so computers are becoming more and more popular 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.170
 In 1978, finally, a 16-bit processor for the general public 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 became accessible 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.800
 that should change everything 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.290
 like 8000 86 from Intel 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 was one of the first victory brought among others for the private home 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.010
 Use were designed 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.380
 equipped with this monster of computing power 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.480
 Conan at that time many march of the first generation 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.010
 with a big smile from her sudden electronics business 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 arrived at home 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.760
 m to increase the electricity bill 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.909
 although the concentrated processing power of this monster 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.220
 almost like a wristwatch 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.040
 you wanted more 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.820
 faster chips were needed 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 One wanted to refine the technique ever further 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 and you have to optimize the structure 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.090
 the heart of a processor 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.320
 want the so-called circuits 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.390
 or transistors 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.650
 but people were awfully smart then 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.200
 from the very soon out that the things still much more current 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.980
 could turn into much more heat and you just more 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.660
 Installing transistors 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 So more sound circles means faster processors 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.140
 Back in the here and now we have not and often already 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.239
 asked what will shape the future 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.849
 in which dimensions will the CPUs of tomorrow count 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.249
 TERA heart 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.689
 Peter Werz 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.849
 Exxon March 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.309
 we travel in an uncertain future 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.519
 strictly speaking in the weir can make any statement about it 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.859
 How should we know that? 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.930
 if there had not been someone 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.069
 it goes up 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.259
 this problem 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 ever thought 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.689
 Humanity is really bored 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.040
 nevertheless we should 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.089
 Herne Gorden watch thank for all his theory hold to this day 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.319
 all major manufacturers of Crazy Zoo 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.139
 and exactly 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.629
 That's why this is so great 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.769
 but let's start from the beginning 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.370
 after Pussy never even named himself Snow twice the number of 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.540
 Transistors on a processor 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.639
 every 24 months 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.309
 So a so-called 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.589
 exponential rise of the circuits 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.259
 here some examples 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.159
 Early 1970s 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.190
 he looked at Dr 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.960
 Intel 4004 the light of the world this possessed at that time 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.099
 and Dell also Licher at the time of 2300 Francis Gates 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.359
 then in 1993 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.480
 they got 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.879
 Kenzie to processors already 3 million 100000 writes circles 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.730
 however, this number should be beat only for ten years later when 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.919
 is 132 times as many 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.219
 those in the two cores have been used by Intel 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.060
 so 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.709
 410 million 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.449
 then in 2010 this number was trumped yet again 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:09.249
 the Intel Itanium 2 has 2 billion and 46 million switches 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.769
 and sooner 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.419
 Unimagined computing capacity 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.150
 in the period of 1971 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.539
 until 2010 therefore 39 years 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.900
 This performance of our small silicon friends was further removed 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 100 78 000 260 Coma they are interviewed 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.580
 instead of 500 kilos of autumn 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.510
 Now we calculate with over 6 times 3 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.180
 Wieker per 1 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.289
 for those who understandably do not know directly 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.870
 What the vulture is a kilo of heart 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.870
 that's what came before the megahertz 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.620
 for the wording of this law would be 1965 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.680
 Had only 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.110
 not only much recognition 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.159
 but also get a job at Intel 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.529
 as a boss 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.859
 for three years later he founds a friend in persistent 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.319
 All other companies are adhering to this law to this day 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.370
 if we limp the numbers therefore 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.200
 he will not have any more to sell 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200
 who this is simply too slow 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.710
 So in any case compared to the rest of the hardware on the market 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.590
 However, if you push too far forward, you also have a disadvantage 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.879
 because what brings me to set a high-end processor 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.879
 if the video card and the memory do not come along 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.610
 then I have theoretically 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.760
 next to a new heating from an apartment 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.460
 also the possibility to advise fried egg on the case 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.160
 but there will probably not be a single game 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.659
 that this power exploits 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.300
 as a final conclusion we can never 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.169
 100% say what the future will bring in terms of hardware 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.509
 especially because the market is very fast-paced 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.710
 but a rough idea and we still ashes 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.460
 because until 2029 the law should remain valid 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.530
 then you are probably slow 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.939
 exhausted physical limits 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.990
 So we can stay excited 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.700
 that was it from us if you liked the video 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.180
 then dive us 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.939
 and relax until the next video relax Black
