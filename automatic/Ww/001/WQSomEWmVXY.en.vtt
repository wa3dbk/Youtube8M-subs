00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.550
 consist 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.280
 in him his aberrant 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.430
 bloomington closed some blue cheese 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.720
 and you're a sauce with the sweet corn of the green giant that we have here and what 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.420
 let's go with some white asparagus 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.000
 the screams in tempura 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.350
 we started circulating the corn simply headline then do it is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.489
 change the textures belgrano we are going to invest in salsa 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.489
 we take it to which also in holland 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.260
 the water that contains no preservatives or colors simply 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.050
 it's a pickle 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.820
 to conserve the sectors 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 and this is titled without more 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.790
 structured dylan 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 just that the tail like 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 afp 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 we have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 I was analyzing a teaspoon 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890
 the rivers 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.400
 that is so we would give used advanced now be it warms has denied to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.320
 use to accompany 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 because that stranger is already talking about his death 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 which is doing very well 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.799
 ready 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.789
 on the other hand in hot oil 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 let's go afridi some white asparagus 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.079
 because the sections that drain 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.079
 I think the green giant thinks all 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 has put a system that is easy is easy 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 and that has been able to remove the trails without breaking the tips 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.079
 also the irrigators run 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.079

 flows as we have done 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 then it is rolled up let's use 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.309
 the asparagus 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.309
