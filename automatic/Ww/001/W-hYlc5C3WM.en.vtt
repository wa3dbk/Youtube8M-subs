00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.940
 well integrated the flour with the rest of 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.160

 we see the return two minutes 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.190
 and we take it out on the plate 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.650
 Now we will wait will wait 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.980
 that we temper a little 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.640
 we let him find out and we will 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.640
 in the fridge 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.020
 good and that has not cooled down and now the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.340
 we cover 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.510
 with the profile and we put it in the fridge 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.300
 Well, if we are going to do it on the day 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.400

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.330
 better how are we going to make ourselves a 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.880

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.430
 now we put the refrigerator and tomorrow the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.650

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.890
 well here as you see we have taken them out 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.159
 of the cold and we have formed them we have 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.989
 left 10 so if we become more 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.900
 small then it will come out arms more or less 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.430
 so that it calculates is the quantity and now 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.829

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.680
 to go through the flour we are going to beat 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.660
 the egg will pass through the egg and through 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.300
 last the bread crumbs and we will go 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.250

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.250
 as soon as the oil gets hot 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.390

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.419
 followed by the beaten egg 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.020
 that we escape from egg well 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.020
 everywhere 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:13.130
 as soon as it is not on paper we spend 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.130

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.889
