00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
also have it in a black white a baby

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.510 
also have it in a black white a baby
blue<00:00:32.030> a<00:00:33.290> charcoal<00:00:34.290> gray<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.829> orange<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
blue a charcoal gray and orange and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.690 
blue a charcoal gray and orange and
yellow<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:36.239> pink<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:38.100> white<00:00:38.309> i<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
yellow a pink and a white i think it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.220 
yellow a pink and a white i think it
made<00:00:38.820> everybody<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.270> white<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.780> retails<00:00:40.170> for

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
made everybody said white it retails for

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
made everybody said white it retails for
2995<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.640> pricier<00:00:42.180> for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
2995 so it's a little bit pricier for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
2995 so it's a little bit pricier for
the<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> watch<00:00:43.110> bands<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.129> overall

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the the watch bands but I think overall

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
the the watch bands but I think overall
the<00:00:45.059> quality<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> its<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> I've

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
you can see the buttons are all covered
up<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.600> nubs<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
up but there are little nubs if so you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
up but there are little nubs if so you
can<00:01:16.259> kind<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> feel<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.220> that's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
can kind of feel where they go so that's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
can kind of feel where they go so that's
like<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.909> switch<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> my

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
like that on switch right there and my

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
like that on switch right there and my
watch<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.950> facing<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> wrong<00:01:20.759> direction<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.240> i

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
watch is facing the wrong direction so i

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
watch is facing the wrong direction so i
rotate<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
rotate it there we go so there's the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.980 
rotate it there we go so there's the
watch<00:01:23.189> miss<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> volume

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
watch miss you see we have the volume

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.359 
watch miss you see we have the volume
the<00:01:25.409> volume<00:01:25.439> buttons<00:01:25.920> right<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the volume buttons right here so you can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
the volume buttons right here so you can
get<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.610> put<00:01:26.970> mess<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.720> those<00:01:27.840> through
