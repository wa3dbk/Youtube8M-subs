SanDisk 64 gigabyte came in the ex fact

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.140 
SanDisk 64 gigabyte came in the ex fact
format<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.449> it<00:00:35.750> worked<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.680> ma<00:00:37.280> didn't

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
format the it worked in the ma didn't

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.390 
format the it worked in the ma didn't
have<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.980> format<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.520> fat32<00:00:41.420> has<00:00:41.860> had<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.040> do<00:00:43.190> on

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
have to format to fat32 has had to do on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.620 
have to format to fat32 has had to do on
some<00:00:43.730> other<00:00:43.970> phones<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.760> good<00:00:46.970> thing<00:00:47.239> with

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
some other phones so the good thing with

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.840 
some other phones so the good thing with
the<00:00:47.899> expert<00:00:48.500> format<00:00:48.980> is<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.640> can

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
the expert format is that you can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.900 
the expert format is that you can
transfer<00:00:50.390> large<00:00:50.989> files<00:00:51.500> over<00:00:52.130> four<00:00:52.399> gigabyte

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
transfer large files over four gigabyte

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.950 
transfer large files over four gigabyte
to<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.360> car<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.470> now<00:00:55.220> it's<00:00:55.790> possible<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.329> view

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
to the car so now it's possible to view

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.780 
to the car so now it's possible to view
pic<00:00:57.670> MTV<00:00:58.670> files<00:00:59.300> directly<00:01:00.260> from<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.829> card<00:01:01.070> so

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
pic MTV files directly from the card so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.930 
pic MTV files directly from the card so
let's<00:01:02.329> take<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.840> look<00:01:03.050> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.200> phone<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:06.759> go<00:01:07.759> into

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
let's take a look on the phone I go into

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.380 
let's take a look on the phone I go into
the<00:01:08.270> MX<00:01:08.690> player<00:01:08.899> here<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.560> let<00:01:10.490> let<00:01:10.970> us<00:01:11.000> take<00:01:11.360> a

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
the MX player here and let let us take a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.359 
the MX player here and let let us take a
look<00:01:12.160> yeah<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:13.930> we<00:01:14.930> see<00:01:15.140> it's<00:01:15.380> seven<00:01:15.979> point

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
look yeah and we see it's seven point

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:26.350 
look yeah and we see it's seven point
one<00:01:16.700> gigabyte<00:01:17.690> big<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:24.470> normally<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.610> big<00:01:26.090> file

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
one gigabyte big so normally a big file

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.810 
one gigabyte big so normally a big file
like<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:26.810> was<00:01:27.290> not<00:01:27.470> possible<00:01:27.650> on<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.310> fat32

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
like this was not possible on the fat32

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.859 
like this was not possible on the fat32
format<00:01:29.689> because<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:31.220> limit<00:01:31.549> on<00:01:31.729> fat32<00:01:32.630> is

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
format because the limit on fat32 is

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.630 
format because the limit on fat32 is
 apart<00:01:34.240> but<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.750> expert<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.460> is

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
 apart but on the expert this is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.090 
 apart but on the expert this is
possible<00:01:38.119> with<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> 64<00:01:39.560> gigabyte<00:01:39.970> SD<00:01:40.970> card<00:01:42.100> so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
possible with a 64 gigabyte SD card so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:02:01.179 
possible with a 64 gigabyte SD card so
let<00:01:43.400> me<00:01:43.549> try<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.820> take<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.570> kickass<00:01:46.180> film<00:01:59.350> me

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
let me try to take the kickass film me

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.819 
let me try to take the kickass film me
so<00:02:01.579> check<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.000> out<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.869> sometimes<00:02:03.170> in

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
like in summarize the sub-query so yes

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.360 
like in summarize the sub-query so yes
this<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:54.139> really<00:02:54.829> cool

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
this is really cool

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.819 
this is really cool
that<00:02:55.549> it's<00:02:56.299> now<00:02:56.480> possible<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:57.260> transfer

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
that it's now possible to transfer

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.140 
that it's now possible to transfer
really<00:02:58.519> big<00:02:58.730> files<00:02:59.079> to<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.109> SD<00:03:00.620> card<00:03:00.889> and<00:03:01.150> play

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
really big files to a SD card and play

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.379 
really big files to a SD card and play
them<00:03:02.419> directly<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.400> device<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.120> HTC<00:03:05.870> m8

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
them directly on device like the HTC m8

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.479 
them directly on device like the HTC m8
actually<00:03:08.389> it<00:03:08.510> doesn't<00:03:08.719> read<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.980> card<00:03:10.310> if

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
actually it doesn't read the card if

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.009 
actually it doesn't read the card if
it's<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.269> fat32<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:13.760> let<00:03:13.969> be<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.569> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
it's in fat32 so just let be in the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.559 
it's in fat32 so just let be in the
exFAT<00:03:15.620> format<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.819> cuts<00:03:17.120> come<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:19.569> so

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
exFAT format that the cuts come with so

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.789 
exFAT format that the cuts come with so
what<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.959> need<00:03:21.169> is<00:03:21.859> an<00:03:22.219> m8<00:03:23.209> or<00:03:23.509> another<00:03:24.409> new

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
what you need is an m8 or another new

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.499 
what you need is an m8 or another new
device<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.790> maybe<00:03:26.599> also<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.139> Samsung<00:03:27.739> s5

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:28.509 
device and maybe also the Samsung s5

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.390 
device and maybe also the Samsung s5
support<00:03:29.509> expect<00:03:30.259> format<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.769> think<00:03:31.069> so

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
support expect format I think so

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.869 
support expect format I think so
and<00:03:31.489> all<00:03:31.939> new<00:03:32.269> devices<00:03:33.189> but<00:03:34.189> all<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.549> devices
