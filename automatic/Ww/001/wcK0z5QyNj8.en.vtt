00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.769
 the face of matt smith 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.530
 all its functioning and on the other side 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.870
 the coolest part of how the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.030
 solo skrewdriver you can see that she 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.329
 saw her any size 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 from lights but let's go to what 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.350
 it matters what it is 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:01:06.450
 the match starts protection and sonic 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.500
 smith nor with a beautiful one of a finish 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 protected purple well as if she 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.750
 had ready to be saved 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.429
 inscribed glee frei vehicles that we 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.090
 we will take the protection to be able to 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.590
 look and this plastic protection here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.560
 for you to store your remote control 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.630
 universal so he does not get any glass 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.399
 and continued 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.399
 already in the bag with great care 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 and here's our sonic skrewdriver her 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.159
 is not heavy is light and has a 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.320
 metal finish 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.350
 her green is not so much like 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.080
 the one from the series can see here from 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.080
 I like to see the posture 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.800
 here is where you can store things 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.010
 Welsh writings 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.940
 Let's put it together with the other one. 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.150
 sonic this one here is the toy 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.730
 a sony who brian and no case this detail 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 does not but closing the two side by side 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.710
 you can see that they both have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 practically the same size 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.010
 the same kind of detail will only change one 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.650
 little agreement that the two sides to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.650
 side when the river song 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.330
 external DVD for you to have 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.520
 idea of the size of each and how 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.210
 does our sony skrewdriver work? 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.060
 come on 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.610
 as I explained to her it is very close to take 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.280
 careful to let it fall because as 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.860
 you can realize it has crashed it can break 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.459

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:02.220

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.970
 we got a key 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.660
 we removed the first screw 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.989
 Okay, first one, let's go to the second now. 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.709
 we remember that the battery does not come with 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.940
 lusa 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.950
 are two AAA batteries per aa or 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.040
 triple by tap and pulled out the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.690
 chopin done is here how are we going 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.269
 put the daughters here unfortunately she 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.100
 does not come with any design then marked 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.620
 you have to look in the manual but already 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.910
 we advanced to you upside to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.260
 low 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.090
 the second daughter with the positive side 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:58.070

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.070
 we put it and close it 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.050
 and how does our sonic work? 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.480
 skrewdriver let's go and call 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.080
 safe and stable button and we are in pax 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.730
 mold 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:19.560
 Let's go right to the left. 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.660
 up down and then to the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.400
 turn it off the same thing 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.350
 button and it makes the same warning and 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.710
 then we saved our sony 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.260

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.820
