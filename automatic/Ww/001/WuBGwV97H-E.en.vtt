00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.170
 hello and welcome on or platelets 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.850
 style today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.360
 how to trace waterfalls in 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:19.199
 really pretty loop so pretty name and 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 It's very simple to do 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 firstly bros comes hair 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.870
 then take a lock of hair like 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.870
 this 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.840
 we 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.340
 once she is well brushed form 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.670
 a loop using your fingers as 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.670
 it 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.190
 now the lower part for 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.900
 form a circle and then set the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.290
 temporarily just to maintain it 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.290
 in place 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.940
 as if if 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.940
 now the fun part 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.680
 take another lock of hair effect 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.950
 pass it inside the first 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950
 loop 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.520
 then repeat the same process makes a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.570
 loop with your second match and i'm 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 going fxopen 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 then you just have to do the same thing again 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.329
 several times takes a strand of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.659
 hair at that through the loop 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.590
 previous and forms a new loop 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.909
 once it's done you can 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.070
 recover the clamp that tends the loop 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.070
 previous and fix the new one with 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.510
 whenever you create one 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 new this is going to hold all the 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.350
 other loops in place 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.410
 you see 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.050
 once you get used to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.720
 autumn there will be even more need 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.130
 to use a plier it's really 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.510
 nice to do during your evenings 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:30.620
 Pajamas with friends continue on everything 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.700
 along your head you can do some 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.700
 loops the size of your choice 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250
 and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.340
 go on 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.769
 good 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.930
 and now we come to the last 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.790
 loop 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.760
 you just have to fix the end with a 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.220
 pin and it's finished a braid 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.170
 beautiful loop waterfalls I can not wait 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.099
 to try this with my friends dilou how 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.739
 you time the exits in the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.390
 comments do not live from your maid and to 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.390
 the chain and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.299
 thank you for watching or wafer 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.299
 style see you soon 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.580
