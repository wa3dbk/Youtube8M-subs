down the skin and the cuticle to remove

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.520 
down the skin and the cuticle to remove
it<00:01:45.189> we<00:01:45.820> do<00:01:46.060> not<00:01:46.240> want<00:01:46.450> any<00:01:46.719> of<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:46.929> residue

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
it we do not want any of that residue

it we do not want any of that residue
left<00:01:47.679> on<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:47.979> now<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.549> will<00:01:48.640> cause

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
left on the now because that will cause

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.609 
left on the now because that will cause
lifting<00:01:49.329> all<00:01:49.570> right<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:49.899> we<00:01:49.990> want<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.320> remove

another<00:02:18.750> cause<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.530> lifting<00:02:20.129> okay<00:02:20.879> because

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
another cause for lifting okay because

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
another cause for lifting okay because
if<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.269> don't<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.629> strong<00:02:21.959> structure

put<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.480> our<00:03:12.510> dehydrator<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.340> dehydrator

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
put on our dehydrator so the dehydrator

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.080 
put on our dehydrator so the dehydrator
I<00:03:15.120> use<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.720> from<00:03:16.200> any<00:03:16.379> site<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:17.010> called<00:03:17.280> nail

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
I use is from any site it's called nail

I use is from any site it's called nail
pureplus<00:03:18.959> now<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.859> main<00:03:20.160> ingredient<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
pureplus now the main ingredient and

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.670 
pureplus now the main ingredient and
that<00:03:21.090> dehydrator<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:22.079> sure<00:03:22.319> with<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> lot

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that dehydrator and I'm sure with a lot

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.430 
that dehydrator and I'm sure with a lot
of<00:03:22.709> dehydrators<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.609> isopropyl<00:03:24.060> alcohol<00:03:24.480> so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
of dehydrators is isopropyl alcohol so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.960 
of dehydrators is isopropyl alcohol so
what<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.919> do<00:03:26.099> is<00:03:26.280> dehydrate

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
what this is going to do is dehydrate

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.360 
what this is going to do is dehydrate
the<00:03:27.060> nail<00:03:27.239> plate<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.930> remove

contaminants<00:03:33.120> okay<00:03:33.599> we<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.019> remove<00:03:34.379> that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
contaminants okay we want to remove that

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
contaminants okay we want to remove that
because<00:03:35.700> that's<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:36.030> bacteria<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.810> feed<00:03:37.079> on

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
because that's what bacteria can feed on

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.309 
because that's what bacteria can feed on
so<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.709> want<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.010> remove<00:03:38.870> anything<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.079> they

so we want to remove anything that they
can<00:03:40.349> feed<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.160> there's<00:03:41.340> less<00:03:41.400> chance

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
can feed on so that there's less chance

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.619 
can feed on so that there's less chance
of<00:03:42.030> an<00:03:42.150> infection<00:03:43.099> okay<00:03:44.099> now<00:03:44.760> before<00:03:45.269> we<00:03:45.419> go<00:03:45.569> to

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
of an infection okay now before we go to

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.780 
of an infection okay now before we go to
apply<00:03:45.959> our<00:03:46.199> primer<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.829> really<00:03:47.430> really

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
apply our primer it's really really

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.349 
apply our primer it's really really
important<00:03:48.449> that<00:03:49.669> the<00:03:50.669> dehydration

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
important that the dehydration

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.349 
important that the dehydration
dehydration<00:03:51.930> process<00:03:52.590> has<00:03:53.190> taken<00:03:53.370> effect<00:03:53.639> so

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
dehydration process has taken effect so

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.720 
dehydration process has taken effect so
the<00:03:55.349> way<00:03:55.500> we<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.859> tell<00:03:56.040> that's<00:03:56.340> happened<00:03:56.669> is

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the way we can tell that's happened is

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.759 
the way we can tell that's happened is
we<00:03:56.849> actually<00:03:56.970> looking<00:03:57.389> at<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.540> nail<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.169> it

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
we actually looking at the nail and it

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.740 
we actually looking at the nail and it
will<00:03:58.889> look<00:03:59.040> choppy<00:03:59.430> white<00:03:59.879> okay<00:04:00.449> so<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:00.660> it

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
will look choppy white okay so if it

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.119 
will look choppy white okay so if it
still<00:04:00.989> looks<00:04:01.139> weird<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.829> finished

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129

not as an acid-free primer and i found

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.170 
not as an acid-free primer and i found
that<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.990> works<00:04:50.230> fantastically<00:04:50.980> i<00:04:51.280> think

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
that that works fantastically i think

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.210

what<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.419> key<00:04:52.630> thing<00:04:52.900> with<00:04:53.050> primer<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:54.040> be

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
what the key thing with primer is to be

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.970 
what the key thing with primer is to be
very<00:04:54.610> very<00:04:54.970> cautious<00:04:55.300> not<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.780> get<00:04:56.020> any<00:04:56.230> on<00:04:56.560> the
