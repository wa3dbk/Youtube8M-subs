00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
keeps all of our inner fluids our blood

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
keeps all of our inner fluids our blood
our<00:00:47.809> chemicals<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> important

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
our chemicals all of the important

things that belong in our body it keeps
them<00:00:52.350> inside<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
them inside and that's really what the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
them inside and that's really what the
outer<00:00:54.780> layer<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> skin<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> epidermis

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
outer layer of skin does the epidermis

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
outer layer of skin does the epidermis
but<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> second<00:00:57.570> layer<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
but then there's a second layer it's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
but then there's a second layer it's
called<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> dermis<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.550> where<00:00:59.670> all

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
called the dermis and that's where all

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.060 
called the dermis and that's where all
the<00:00:59.789> machinery<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.559> dermis<00:01:01.890> has

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the machinery is and the dermis has

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
the machinery is and the dermis has
things<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.760> hair<00:01:03.000> follicles<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.629> sweat

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
things like hair follicles and sweat

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
things like hair follicles and sweat
glands<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:05.250> where<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> blood<00:01:05.729> vessels

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
glands that's where the blood vessels

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
glands that's where the blood vessels
are<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.930> how<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.140> control<00:01:07.409> our

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
are that's how we control our

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.969 
are that's how we control our
temperature<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.479> perspire

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
temperature that's how we perspire

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
temperature that's how we perspire
that's<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.159> feel<00:01:11.549> things<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.090> nerves

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that's how we feel things with nerves

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's how we feel things with nerves
and<00:01:12.979> lastly<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.820> bottom<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and lastly on the very bottom is the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
and lastly on the very bottom is the
subcutaneous<00:01:16.619> layer<00:01:17.310> which<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
subcutaneous layer which is really the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
subcutaneous layer which is really the
fat<00:01:18.330> layer<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> store<00:01:20.040> energy

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
fat layer that's there to store energy

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
fat layer that's there to store energy
it<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:21.180> helps<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.860> regulation<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it also helps with regulation of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
it also helps with regulation of
temperature<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.270> helps<00:01:24.689> buffer<00:01:25.170> us

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
temperature and it also helps buffer us

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.070 
temperature and it also helps buffer us
against<00:01:25.710> injury<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.180> older<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.900> gets

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
against injury as we get older it gets

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
against injury as we get older it gets
thinner<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> things

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
thinner and that's one of the things

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
thinner and that's one of the things
that's<00:01:29.909> responsible<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.229> appearance<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that's responsible for the appearance of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.399 
that's responsible for the appearance of
an<00:01:31.860> aging<00:01:32.310> face<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.090> fact<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> fat<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
an aging face the fact that the fat is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.520 
an aging face the fact that the fat is
thinning<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> next<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.259> take

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
thinning out so the next time you take

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.940 
thinning out so the next time you take
your<00:01:38.159> skin<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.700> granted<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.509> remember<00:01:40.439> it's
