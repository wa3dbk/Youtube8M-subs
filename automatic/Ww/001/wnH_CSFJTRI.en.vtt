get those ends you can get a little bit

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.430 
get those ends you can get a little bit
more<00:03:24.620> into<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.250> by<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:26.170> sectioning<00:03:27.170> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
more into it by just sectioning and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.750 
more into it by just sectioning and
focusing<00:03:27.859> right<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.280> ends<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
curling wand if your ends are sticking

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.940 
curling wand if your ends are sticking
out<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.340> just<00:03:32.060> kind<00:03:32.299> of<00:03:32.390> hold<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.769> can

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
out and just kind of hold it and you can

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.259 
out and just kind of hold it and you can
see<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.370> end<00:03:34.579> will<00:03:34.760> get<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> little<00:03:35.060> bit

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
see that the end will get a little bit

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.810 
see that the end will get a little bit
more<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.660> bump<00:03:35.930> but<00:03:36.260> that's<00:03:36.290> pretty<00:03:37.220> much<00:03:37.459> a
