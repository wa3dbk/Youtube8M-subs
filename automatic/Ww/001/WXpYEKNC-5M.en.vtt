our theme of looking at some traditional

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.990 
our theme of looking at some traditional
origami<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.890> today<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.640> make<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
origami and today we're going to make a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.160 
origami and today we're going to make a
catcher's<00:00:12.600> mitt

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
catcher's mitt

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.900 
catcher's mitt
now<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.710> origami<00:00:13.950> tends<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.520> work<00:00:14.580> really

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
now this origami tends to work really

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.510 
now this origami tends to work really
good<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.270> you<00:00:15.360> use<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.720> newspaper<00:00:16.520> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
good if you use some newspaper the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.489 
good if you use some newspaper the
dimensions<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.689> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.929> feel<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:19.499 
dimensions and the kind of feel for it

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:20.929 
dimensions and the kind of feel for it
will<00:00:19.619> change<00:00:19.890> depending<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> size<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
will change depending on the size of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.029 
will change depending on the size of
paper<00:00:21.089> you<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.599> I'm<00:00:22.169> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> use<00:00:22.589> just<00:00:22.890> some

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
paper you use I'm going to use just some

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.329 
paper you use I'm going to use just some
b3<00:00:23.849> paper<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.869> folds<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> give

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
b3 paper that folds up and have to give

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.899 
b3 paper that folds up and have to give
you<00:00:26.429> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> stronger<00:00:27.269> piece<00:00:28.669> see<00:00:29.669> every

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
you kind of a stronger piece see every

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:37.459 
you kind of a stronger piece see every
size<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.749> but<00:00:35.750> essentially<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:37.170> see

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
size is that but essentially let's see

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
size is that but essentially let's see
here<00:00:37.739> twenty<00:00:38.430> five<00:00:38.760> point<00:00:39.270> seven<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:41.629> thirty

and thirty six point two that's the size
paper<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.100> I'll<00:00:54.059> let<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> guys

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
paper I'm using and I'll let you guys

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.819 
paper I'm using and I'll let you guys
know<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.809> dimensions<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> everything<00:00:55.710> when

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
know the dimensions of everything when

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
know the dimensions of everything when
we're<00:00:55.980> finished<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.489> kind<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> give<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.940> an

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
we're finished to kind of give you an

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
we're finished to kind of give you an
idea<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.839> works<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.679> does<00:00:58.859> really

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
idea of how it works but it does really

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
idea of how it works but it does really
work<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.640> newspaper<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.539> paper<00:01:00.929> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
work good with newspaper and paper like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.739 
work good with newspaper and paper like
that<00:01:01.519> what's<00:01:02.519> good<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.390> start<00:01:03.660> with

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
that what's good is to start with

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.270 
that what's good is to start with
something<00:01:03.929> big<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.440> this<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.129> what

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
something big like this and then what

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 
something big like this and then what
we're<00:01:05.370> gonna<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.150> fold<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.200> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we're gonna do is actually fold it in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100 
we're gonna do is actually fold it in
half<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.009> that'll<00:01:08.850> give<00:01:09.000> us<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:10.079> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
half and that'll give us the kind of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
half and that'll give us the kind of
thickness<00:01:10.409> maybe<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.070> we'd<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> have

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
thickness maybe that we'd like to have

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
thickness maybe that we'd like to have
to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.290> need<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to make this go the way we need it to so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
to make this go the way we need it to so
I've<00:01:15.060> got<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> folded<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.750> half<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.619> want

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I've got it folded in half then I want

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
I've got it folded in half then I want
to<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> create<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.210> crease

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to just go ahead and create a big crease

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
to just go ahead and create a big crease
right<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.079> middle<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.159> gonna

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right down the middle here so I'm gonna

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
right down the middle here so I'm gonna
take<00:01:20.520> both<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:20.939> sides<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> fold<00:01:21.750> over<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.290> make

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
take both my sides and fold over to make

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.039 
take both my sides and fold over to make
a<00:01:22.439> big<00:01:22.770> crease<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> center<00:01:24.049> open

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
a big crease right down the center open

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
a big crease right down the center open
things<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.610> section<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
things up then take the top section and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
things up then take the top section and
roll<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> down<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.409> even<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
roll it down so that it's even with the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.639 
roll it down so that it's even with the
center<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.509> crease<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.530> do

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
center make a good crease here and do

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.100 
center make a good crease here and do
the<00:01:31.770> same<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> other<00:01:32.520> side<00:01:36.110> then

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the same thing on the other side then

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.389 
the same thing on the other side then
we're<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> repeat<00:01:37.920> those<00:01:38.130> steps

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
we're going to repeat those steps

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.370 
we're going to repeat those steps
bringing<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> creased<00:01:39.600> edge<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bringing that creased edge into the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
bringing that creased edge into the
center<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.250> paper<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> little

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
center and this paper can get a little

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.520 
center and this paper can get a little
thick<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.750> working<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
thick as you're working with it just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
thick as you're working with it just
take<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.829> time<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> try<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> good

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
take your time and try to get a good

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:57.270 
take your time and try to get a good
crease<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.619> through<00:01:46.950> everything<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.200 

so<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.369> have<00:01:58.460> something<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.880> looks<00:01:58.999> like

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
so we have something that looks like

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.230 
so we have something that looks like
this<00:01:59.619> go<00:02:00.619> ahead<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:00.770> flip<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.159> over<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.609> then

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
this go ahead and flip it over and then

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.730 
this go ahead and flip it over and then
what<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:02.509> want<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.749> do<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.990> take<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.409> bottom

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
what we want to do is take the bottom

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.649 
what we want to do is take the bottom
part<00:02:03.920> down<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.759> fold<00:02:05.179> it<00:02:05.299> up<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
part down here and fold it up so that

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.840 
part down here and fold it up so that
these<00:02:05.960> corners<00:02:06.590> match<00:02:06.979> right<00:02:07.369> where<00:02:07.609> these

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
these corners match right where these

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.029 
these corners match right where these
little<00:02:08.090> edges<00:02:08.450> are<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> side<00:02:09.500> from<00:02:09.890> where

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
little edges are on the side from where

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.039 
little edges are on the side from where
we<00:02:10.160> fold<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.459> over<00:02:10.549> before<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.720> I'm<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:11.959> gonna

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
we fold it over before so I'm just gonna

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.400 
we fold it over before so I'm just gonna
go<00:02:12.260> ahead<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.709> roll<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.519> fold<00:02:13.849> there

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
go ahead and roll up and fold there

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.150 
go ahead and roll up and fold there
that's<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.769> crease<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:18.769> gonna<00:02:18.920> roll<00:02:19.129> up

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
that's one crease then I'm gonna roll up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.960 
that's one crease then I'm gonna roll up
on<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:20.150> one<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:21.049> time<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:24.580> then<00:02:25.580> do<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.849> one

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
on that one more time and then do it one

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.619 
on that one more time and then do it one
more<00:02:26.150> time

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.740 

and<00:02:30.069> then<00:02:31.069> one<00:02:31.489> last<00:02:31.790> time<00:02:34.360> things<00:02:35.360> might<00:02:35.599> get

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and then one last time things might get

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.180 
and then one last time things might get
a<00:02:35.810> little<00:02:35.870> crumbly<00:02:36.319> but<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.680> should<00:02:36.890> wind<00:02:37.069> up

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
a little crumbly but you should wind up

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.259 
a little crumbly but you should wind up
with<00:02:37.340> something<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.849> kind<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.060> looks<00:02:38.209> like

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
with something that kind of looks like

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.569 
with something that kind of looks like
this

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
this

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.720 
this
then<00:02:40.579> I<00:02:40.610> want<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.000> take<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.989> outer<00:02:42.410> edge<00:02:43.069> here

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
then I want to take the outer edge here

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.750 
then I want to take the outer edge here
this<00:02:43.910> little<00:02:44.060> point<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.810> fold<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.860> up<00:02:46.069> so<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
this little point and fold it up so that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.360 
this little point and fold it up so that
it<00:02:47.060> hits<00:02:47.299> right<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.709> center<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it hits right in the center and the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.250 
it hits right in the center and the
angle<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.910> do<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.180> at<00:02:50.359> can<00:02:50.660> kind<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.019> change

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
angle you do this at can kind of change

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.380 
angle you do this at can kind of change
you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.709> obviously<00:02:52.010> bring<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.879> really<00:02:53.150> far<00:02:53.359> up

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you can obviously bring it really far up

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.930 
you can obviously bring it really far up
but<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:53.930> want<00:02:54.109> to<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.410> bring<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.940> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
but we want to kind of bring it out so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.050 
but we want to kind of bring it out so
that<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.269> get<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.450> good<00:02:56.720> angle<00:02:57.079> here<00:02:57.739> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
that you get a good angle here and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.910 
that you get a good angle here and
there's<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.150> lot<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.660> papers<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:00.500> might

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there's a lot of papers so this might

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.379 
there's a lot of papers so this might
need<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.370> help<00:03:01.489> as<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.090> make<00:03:02.239> this

need a little help as you make this

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.059 
need a little help as you make this
crease<00:03:02.750> cuz<00:03:03.079> there's<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.349> lot<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.620> paper<00:03:03.829> right

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
crease cuz there's a lot of paper right

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.949 
crease cuz there's a lot of paper right
down<00:03:04.250> there<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:05.329> I'm<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.569> gonna<00:03:05.720> make<00:03:05.930> a

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
down there but I'm just gonna make a

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.949 
down there but I'm just gonna make a
good<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:07.060> kind<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.150> smooshed<00:03:08.569> crease

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
good little kind of smooshed crease

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.170 
good little kind of smooshed crease
right<00:03:09.200> there<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.950> then<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.700> same<00:03:10.940> thing

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
right there and then do the same thing

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.039 
right there and then do the same thing
on<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.450> side<00:03:11.690> too<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:17.329> we<00:03:17.480> get<00:03:17.630> both<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.959> those

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
on this side too so we get both of those

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.979 
on this side too so we get both of those
kind<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.410> meeting<00:03:18.859> in<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.099> center<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.989> then

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
kind of meeting in the center there then

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.229 
kind of meeting in the center there then
I'm<00:03:21.410> gonna<00:03:21.560> take<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.040> top<00:03:22.250> section<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.060> we're

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
I'm gonna take the top section and we're

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.089 
I'm gonna take the top section and we're
just<00:03:23.359> gonna<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.720> ahead<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.109> fold<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.650> little<00:03:24.799> of

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
just gonna go ahead and fold a little of

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.520 
just gonna go ahead and fold a little of
this<00:03:25.340> point<00:03:26.060> down<00:03:26.599> so<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.139> we<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:27.319> get

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
this point down so that we don't get

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.860 
this point down so that we don't get
such<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> sharp<00:03:28.010> point<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.519> there<00:03:28.669> and<00:03:28.970> then<00:03:29.840> I

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
such a sharp point up there and then I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.830 
such a sharp point up there and then I
want<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.260> take<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:31.250> whole<00:03:31.549> section<00:03:32.299> here<00:03:32.329> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
want to take this whole section here and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.979 
want to take this whole section here and
bring<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.590> down<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.579> tucks<00:03:34.940> into<00:03:35.870> this

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
bring it down so that it tucks into this

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.129 
bring it down so that it tucks into this
pocket<00:03:36.319> area<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.120> I'll<00:03:38.120> slide<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:38.959> as

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
pocket area and I'll slide that down as

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.940 
pocket area and I'll slide that down as
far<00:03:39.319> as<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.560> can<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.980> there<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:44.709> keep<00:03:45.709> things

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
far as I can in there I keep things

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.819 
far as I can in there I keep things
lined<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.549> with<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.849> center<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:48.620> gives

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
lined up with the center and that gives

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.039 
lined up with the center and that gives
you<00:03:48.919> a<00:03:48.950> finished<00:03:49.370> mitt<00:03:49.970> now<00:03:50.389> if<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.780> look<00:03:50.959> at

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
you a finished mitt now if you look at

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.110 
you a finished mitt now if you look at
it<00:03:51.200> from<00:03:51.349> behind<00:03:51.500> you've<00:03:52.190> got<00:03:52.430> these<00:03:52.669> two

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
it from behind you've got these two

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.280 
it from behind you've got these two
little<00:03:53.750> sections<00:03:53.959> here<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.340> can<00:03:55.519> put

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
little sections here that you can put

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.890 
little sections here that you can put
you<00:03:57.290> know<00:03:57.440> your<00:03:57.650> hand<00:03:58.040> into<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.879> some<00:03:59.209> way<00:03:59.389> in<00:03:59.750> a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
you know your hand into in some way in a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.599 
you know your hand into in some way in a
fashion<00:04:00.319> and<00:04:00.799> if<00:04:00.919> you<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.340> kind<00:04:01.489> of

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
fashion and if you get it kind of

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.029 
fashion and if you get it kind of
bending<00:04:02.239> around<00:04:02.510> right<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.079> could<00:04:03.259> create<00:04:03.500> a

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:04.039 
bending around right you could create a

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.770 
bending around right you could create a
little<00:04:04.699> way<00:04:04.970> to

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
little way to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.230 
little way to
things<00:04:06.200> with<00:04:06.410> their<00:04:06.560> hands<00:04:06.830> now<00:04:07.520> this<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.910> even

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
things with their hands now this is even

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.940 
things with their hands now this is even
small<00:04:08.660> for<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.080> model<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.500> can<00:04:09.650> kind<00:04:09.860> of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
small for the model you can kind of

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.860 
small for the model you can kind of
imagine<00:04:10.100> maybe<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.910> little<00:04:11.060> kids<00:04:11.390> hand<00:04:11.630> might

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
imagine maybe a little kids hand might

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.200 
imagine maybe a little kids hand might
work<00:04:12.170> okay<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.650> here<00:04:12.830> but<00:04:13.100> we're<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.730> kind<00:04:14.150> of

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
work okay in here but we're just kind of

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.000 
work okay in here but we're just kind of
looking<00:04:14.480> at<00:04:14.630> creating<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.170> space<00:04:15.470> here<00:04:15.830> where

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.060 
looking at creating a space here where
you<00:04:16.130> can<00:04:16.370> create<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.840> way<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.410> kind<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.799> catch

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
you can create a way to kind of catch

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.680 
you can create a way to kind of catch
something<00:04:19.579> in<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.760> middle<00:04:19.970> by<00:04:20.150> putting<00:04:20.600> a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
something in the middle by putting a

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.150 
something in the middle by putting a
little<00:04:20.720> pressure<00:04:20.930> here<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.829> can<00:04:21.980> imagine

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
little pressure here you can imagine

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.520 
little pressure here you can imagine
kind<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.580> catching<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.060> ball<00:04:23.270> with<00:04:23.480> this<00:04:23.690> so

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
kind of catching the ball with this so

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.410 
kind of catching the ball with this so
it's<00:04:24.680> kind<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.980> fun<00:04:25.250> little<00:04:25.420> quick

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
it's kind of a fun little quick

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.780 
it's kind of a fun little quick
alternative<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.620> playing<00:04:27.920> with<00:04:28.370> some<00:04:28.520> things

create a little bit of pressure here to

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.670 
create a little bit of pressure here to
catch<00:04:45.710> something<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:47.450> that's<00:04:47.720> just<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.260> sort

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
catch something and that's just a sort

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.490 
catch something and that's just a sort
of<00:04:48.740> really<00:04:48.919> simplistic<00:04:49.430> kind<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.120> design<00:04:50.500> the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
of really simplistic kind of design the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.260 
of really simplistic kind of design the
dimensions<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.340> came<00:04:52.400> up<00:04:52.820> with<00:04:52.850> even

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
dimensions that I came up with even

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.820 
dimensions that I came up with even
though<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.390> started<00:04:53.780> with<00:04:53.870> such<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> large<00:04:54.560> piece

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
though I started with such a large piece

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.220 
though I started with such a large piece
of<00:04:54.860> paper<00:04:55.100> was<00:04:55.580> about<00:04:56.180> 11<00:04:56.600> centimeters<00:04:57.080> across

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
of paper was about 11 centimeters across

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.780 
of paper was about 11 centimeters across
and<00:04:57.800> about<00:04:58.640> sub<00:04:59.120> 8<00:04:59.330> centimeters<00:04:59.960> wide<00:05:00.230> and<00:05:00.790> you

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
and about sub 8 centimeters wide and you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
and about sub 8 centimeters wide and you
can<00:05:01.940> really<00:05:02.060> play<00:05:02.270> around<00:05:02.480> with<00:05:02.630> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
can really play around with the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.770 
can really play around with the
difference<00:05:03.340> paper<00:05:04.340> sizes<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:05.150> really<00:05:05.540> think<00:05:05.690> it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
difference paper sizes I really think it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.300 
difference paper sizes I really think it
helps<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.200> kind<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.440> double<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.830> paper<00:05:07.100> up

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
helps to kind of double the paper up

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.680 
helps to kind of double the paper up
though<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.640> beginning<00:05:07.970> if<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.419> just

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
though in the beginning if you just

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.050 
though in the beginning if you just
start<00:05:09.020> with<00:05:09.110> one<00:05:09.350> thin<00:05:09.710> sheet<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.100> paper<00:05:10.280> it's

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
start with one thin sheet of paper it's

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.940 
start with one thin sheet of paper it's
not<00:05:11.300> going<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.510> be<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.660> very<00:05:11.900> useful<00:05:12.229> kind<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
not going to be a very useful kind of

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.090 
not going to be a very useful kind of
mitt<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:13.610> but<00:05:14.540> this<00:05:14.660> was<00:05:14.810> 11<00:05:15.229> centimeters<00:05:15.770> wide

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
mitt so but this was 11 centimeters wide

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.740 
mitt so but this was 11 centimeters wide
and<00:05:16.550> about<00:05:17.419> 8<00:05:17.720> centimeters<00:05:18.200> tall<00:05:19.540> give<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:20.630> an

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
and about 8 centimeters tall give you an

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.190 
and about 8 centimeters tall give you an
idea<00:05:20.950> but<00:05:21.950> this<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.150> finished<00:05:23.990> little

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
idea but this is the finished little

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680 
idea but this is the finished little
project<00:05:24.800> there<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.280> catcher's<00:05:26.060> mitt<00:05:26.210> which<00:05:26.540> is
