00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello today the molecular kitchen is 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 supernatural 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 Let's teach you how to make foods that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.540
 shine in the dark you'll learn to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.549
 to campaign on that ghost in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.509
 mutants that shine with the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.509
 help with black light 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 first we'll make jelly 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.019
 amount will only need a packet of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 pineapple gelatin 250 ml water 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 boiling 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 the element of surprise which is the keynote of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.980
 first until you get the gelatin package 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.980
 and put inside the pot 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.850
 after you see hot water 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.450
 now put 250 ml of tonic water 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.450
 cold and stir 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:15.700
 After we play well, we're going to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:17.500
 refrigerator and let it stand firm and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.630
 Now we're going to do the campis. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.369
 ghosts that also shine in the black light 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.710
 to make this recipe we 'll need 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.360
 of pre-made persimmons 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.369
 if you do not know how to make cupcakes yet 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 will have a link to the recipe that you 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.590
 can manufacture the anticipated case 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.330
 not just focus on the icing 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.250
 shines in the dark for this recipe we 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.440
 let's use three and a half cups 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.540
 a few drops of icing sugar 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.850
 chocolate cupcakes we've already made 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.090
 by anticipation half a cup of fat 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.440
 vegetable and 100 ml our ingredients 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.690
 supersecret again here tonic water 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.280
 that will give that supernatural glow 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.780
 When we put it on after I 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.759
 I was in the black light first we go 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.090
 then put loving and vegetable here in the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.460
 food mixer 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.640
 then we put the essence here 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.640
 vanilla 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.130
 Here we are going to hit the fat here. 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.729
 with the essence of vanilla to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.729
 see what will happen 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.830
 It's actually not working very well because 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.290
 how to reduce this revenue a little there 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.000
 fat does not fit very well here it 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.200
 I was very little to hit 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.550
 Let's put some of the water here. 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.130
 now part of it is only one 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.740
 little sugar is already putting sugar 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 and gradually here in the mixer and beating 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.620
 with fat 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.620
 I want to be very consistent 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.710
 when you look good being neighbors where 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.810
 was not to fall more in the spoon 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.610
 It's time to stop beating there. 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.380
 we just put a bag without a beak 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.000
 even alone that points open to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.570
 to be able to decorate our 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.570
 because I wanted 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.940
 is 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.840
 Meanwhile the gelatin is ready 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.380
 So just take the refrigerator and cut it. 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.380
 in cubes 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.930
 then just put the revenues under the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.390
 black light they will shine in the dark 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 here in the chamber may not be 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.170
 appearing also the son as it is in life 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.880
 because our camera does not have a 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.650
 very good light capture 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.660
 this happens because the tannin that is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.850
 present in tonic water it ends 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.560
 reflecting ultraviolet light a form 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.170
 modified you can see why 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.220
 he shines these nec things around no 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.220
 It seems very poisonous. 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.340
