00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 may together come here today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.359
 a little different video and that's me 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.980
 imagine ten cases of food 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.240
 fatburner foods heat the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.380
 metabolism and thus also the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.969
 fat burning on 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 They can help excess fat 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.450
 Get rid of the first food yourself 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 wants to show you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.890
 citrus fruits and that too, for example 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.560
 Lemons have a very high 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 Vitamin C content that is just the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 fat burning and also provides 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 still for taut fabric and the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 lemons also contain l carnitine and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 that's how the body burns 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 even more fat if you can do it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 Of course you can eat them pure but 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 also just cut small into a glass 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.149
 give and then fill with water or 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.129
 blackmail the drone and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.070
 then fill the rest with water to the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 second are just spicy food 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 eg chili and pepper and it in it 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 Capsaicin contains this capsaicin 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 then lies just this fatburner and it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.020
 you can easily eat in any 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.940
 install 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 At the very end of the video I show you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 Also to salad in which some of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.040
 Infections are in it and the next 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.350
 neatly burning euro fat burning 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 Number three is somehow the one in which 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.479
 in addition also to that the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 lactic acid production is increased and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.380
 This will give you better ones 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.090
 circulation is great too 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
 if you want to build muscle then 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 your muscles are better supplied with blood 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 fourth are instead of sugar can 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.400
 one super e10 use on for example 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.829
 Fruit in cereal with oatmeal with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.140
 yogurt with quark or even in the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.329
 pancake cinnamon not only sculpts the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 fat burning on but that depends 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.759
 even the blood sugar level and the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.159
 blood lipid values 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 I would work on green 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.899
 at least one green tea every day 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.240
 it does not just contain caffeine 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.549
 increased to short-term 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.020
 Burning fat leads but that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.810
 polyphenol gcg is the full name 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 this leads to the increase of the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 Body heat the combination of eg and caffeine 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 is perfect for losing weight 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 sixth, drink a lot of water 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.880
 the hydrogenation leads to that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.550
 the body drives down the metabolism 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.810
 and we do not want to and I water 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.150
 also find the metabolism 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.310
 you will waste out and you should do a lot 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.570
 Drink with it the love of body fat 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.490
 what you want to lose weight 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.980
 you can not metabolize it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.760
 believe but fat is very important to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.400
 lose weight 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.870
 especially also omega-3 fatty acids 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.750
 help with fat burning and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.090
 Also improve digestion 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.590
 it is well known that omega-3 is in fish 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.220
 but is also still in oil rapeseed oil 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 walnuts soybean oil paprika spinach and man 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.090
 should also be monounsaturated 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 For example, fatty acids are eaten in 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 peanut butter or olive oil in another 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.190
 fat burner food is the crÃªpes 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.380
 food which keeps insulin levels in the blood 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.120
 constant there is a study in the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 three times a day in hall 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.360
 fight 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.880
 have and have in twelve weeks 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.600
 who have lost and lost up to five kilos 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.459
 Nothing else changed by truck team 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.350
 l carnitine is present in the meat 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.350
 but also gives liquid and in capsules 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.720
 I buy you post marks Amazon link 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.239
 in the infobox that helps 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.970
 tying into the muscle cells 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.700
 and there it can be burned and it 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.400
 but only works in conjunction with sport 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.900
 tenth zionist ingredient of the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.100
 the thyroid hormone produced 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.140
 thyroxine and theo tyrolean have both in 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.600
 the fat degrades and the metabolism 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.780
 involved if you have too little iodine in the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.640
 If you have too few hormones then you have body 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.320
 produces and one assumes to have 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.750
 Also a suggestion like you some 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.820
 clubs could eat together and indeed 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400
 I have taken in salad to take 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.760
 Her iceberg lettuce removes the outside 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.989
 leaves and the other small pieces 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.500
 then I was brief and through you 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.019
 let drain into the salad you can 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.900
 make vegetables pure that you like I have 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.480
 tomato cucumbers chopped small 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.280
 now it's their turn and that's what I have 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480
 plus two small dried chillies 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.700
 cut small 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 but it fits my salad was real 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 really hot for me too 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.520
 sharp and healthy for the fats and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 but a higher one 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.030
 calorie count then comes one more 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.560
 Half calories and some oil 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.710
 Finally, you give her salt pepper 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.349
 lemon juice and your iceberg lettuce 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.389
 and finished is your fatburner I should 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.220
