training and today we're going to talk

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.280 
training and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.460> high<00:00:07.790> level<00:00:08.149> clutch<00:00:08.389> control<00:00:08.840> and<00:00:09.080> how

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
about high level clutch control and how

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.049 
about high level clutch control and how
important<00:00:09.740> it<00:00:09.830> is<00:00:09.860> to<00:00:09.980> make<00:00:10.280> your<00:00:10.430> motorcycle

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
important it is to make your motorcycle

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.029 
important it is to make your motorcycle
do<00:00:11.209> what<00:00:11.299> you<00:00:11.389> want<00:00:11.600> to<00:00:11.680> you<00:00:12.680> want<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:12.889> make

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
do what you want to you want to make

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.740 
do what you want to you want to make
sure<00:00:13.219> that<00:00:13.369> you're<00:00:13.520> using<00:00:13.549> two<00:00:14.150> fingers<00:00:14.570> to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
sure that you're using two fingers to

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.450 
sure that you're using two fingers to
operate<00:00:15.110> your<00:00:15.260> clutch<00:00:15.559> one<00:00:15.980> or<00:00:16.100> two<00:00:16.250> fingers

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
operate your clutch one or two fingers

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.340 
operate your clutch one or two fingers
so<00:00:17.000> your<00:00:17.119> other<00:00:17.210> two<00:00:17.449> fingers<00:00:17.660> can<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.020> wrapped

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
so your other two fingers can be wrapped

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.829 
so your other two fingers can be wrapped
around<00:00:18.500> hanging<00:00:19.010> onto<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.310> handlebar

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:19.839 
around hanging onto the handlebar

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.820 
around hanging onto the handlebar
additionally<00:00:20.839> you<00:00:21.169> want<00:00:21.349> to<00:00:21.410> make<00:00:21.500> sure<00:00:21.529> your

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
additionally you want to make sure your

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.849 
additionally you want to make sure your
lever<00:00:22.070> position<00:00:22.419> is<00:00:23.419> in<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.689> right<00:00:23.900> angle<00:00:24.710> so

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
lever position is in the right angle so

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.169 
lever position is in the right angle so
it<00:00:24.949> doesn't<00:00:25.220> put<00:00:25.310> your<00:00:25.429> wrist<00:00:25.699> at<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:25.970> weird

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
it doesn't put your wrist at a weird

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.620 
it doesn't put your wrist at a weird
angle

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
angle

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.079 
angle
and<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.320> your<00:00:27.470> friction<00:00:27.949> zone<00:00:27.980> or<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.820> point

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
and then your friction zone or the point

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.239 
and then your friction zone or the point
where<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.300> clutch<00:00:29.509> engages<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.409> needs<00:00:31.039> to

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:31.249 
where the clutch engages that needs to

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.550 
where the clutch engages that needs to
be<00:00:31.429> in<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.329> right<00:00:32.509> spot<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:32.960> you're<00:00:33.440> not

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
be in the right spot so you're not

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.410 
be in the right spot so you're not
having<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.950> reach<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.460> extend<00:00:34.850> your<00:00:34.910> hand<00:00:35.210> or

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
having to reach and extend your hand or

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.330 
having to reach and extend your hand or
your<00:00:35.780> lever<00:00:36.050> isn't<00:00:36.380> bumping<00:00:36.680> up<00:00:36.800> against<00:00:37.160> your

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
your lever isn't bumping up against your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.040 
your lever isn't bumping up against your
other<00:00:37.640> two<00:00:37.970> fingers<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.660> start<00:00:38.930> to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
other two fingers when you start to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.040 
other two fingers when you start to
disengage<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.710> clutch<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:41.420> practice<00:00:41.870> this

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
disengage the clutch to practice this

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.390 
disengage the clutch to practice this
what<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.320> want<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.560> do<00:00:42.650> is<00:00:42.800> find<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.130> small

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
what you want to do is find a small

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.460 
what you want to do is find a small
incline<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.940> put<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.240> bike<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.990> then

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
incline to put the bike on and then

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.130 
incline to put the bike on and then
using<00:00:45.920> your<00:00:46.360> just<00:00:47.360> your<00:00:47.540> clutch<00:00:47.780> with<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
using your just your clutch with the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.140 
using your just your clutch with the
bike<00:00:48.290> idling<00:00:48.830> you<00:00:49.340> want<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.640> allow<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.880> bike

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
bike idling you want to allow the bike

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.360 
bike idling you want to allow the bike
to<00:00:50.330> rock<00:00:50.510> forward<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.200> back<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:51.830> forward<00:00:52.220> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
to rock forward and back and forward and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.980 
to rock forward and back and forward and
back<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.940> trick<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.360> keep<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.780> very

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
back and the trick is to keep it very

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.230 
back and the trick is to keep it very
smooth<00:00:54.440> without<00:00:55.010> making<00:00:55.550> big<00:00:55.790> giant

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
smooth without making big giant

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.090 
smooth without making big giant
movements<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:56.900> lever<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.740> have<00:00:57.950> it

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
movements of the lever so you have it

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.680 
movements of the lever so you have it
just<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.640> friction<00:00:58.910> zone<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.540> you're

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
just in the friction zone and you're

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.120 
just in the friction zone and you're
controlling<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.380> movement<00:01:00.770> of<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.920> bike

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
controlling the movement of the bike

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.390 
controlling the movement of the bike
with<00:01:01.730> only<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.150> clutch<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.710> next<00:01:04.009> level<00:01:04.309> of

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
with only the clutch the next level of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.130 
with only the clutch the next level of
practice<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.239> learn<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.449> use<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.810> clutch

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
practice is to learn to use the clutch

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.319 
practice is to learn to use the clutch
as<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> power<00:01:06.619> amplifier<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.490> what<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.119> does

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
as a power amplifier and what that does

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.149 
as a power amplifier and what that does
is<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.600> use<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.049> snap<00:01:09.409> of<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.679> clutch<00:01:09.920> to

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
is you use the snap of the clutch to

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.310 
is you use the snap of the clutch to
give<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.429> bike<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:10.609> burst<00:01:10.969> of<00:01:11.149> power<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.719> also

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
give the bike a burst of power and also

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.469 
give the bike a burst of power and also
to<00:01:12.649> keep<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.950> bike<00:01:13.070> under<00:01:13.399> control<00:01:13.789> this<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
to keep the bike under control this is a

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.359 
to keep the bike under control this is a
much<00:01:14.689> more<00:01:15.109> difficult<00:01:15.289> drill<00:01:15.859> and<00:01:16.249> what

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
much more difficult drill and what

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.739 
much more difficult drill and what
you're<00:01:16.520> going<00:01:16.609> to<00:01:16.700> do<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.299> you're<00:01:17.479> going<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.659> be

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
you're going to do is you're going to be

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.300 
you're going to do is you're going to be
snapping<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.409> little<00:01:18.649> bit<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:18.890> throttle

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
snapping a little bit of the throttle

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.440 
snapping a little bit of the throttle
and<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.429> clutch<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.999> have<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.270> bike

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
and the clutch and have the bike

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.300 
and the clutch and have the bike
actually<00:01:20.719> lift<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.649> front<00:01:21.920> wheel<00:01:21.979> off<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
actually lift the front wheel off the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.340 
actually lift the front wheel off the
ground<00:01:22.490> before<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.119> starts<00:01:23.479> moving<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.229> you're

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
ground before it starts moving so you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
ground before it starts moving so you're
starting<00:01:24.679> to<00:01:24.770> throw<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.979> lot<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.280> traction<00:01:25.579> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
starting to throw a lot of traction and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.719 
starting to throw a lot of traction and
a<00:01:26.390> high<00:01:26.600> level<00:01:26.869> clutch<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.890> throttle<00:01:27.950> control

going to be staying stationary and it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.699 
going to be staying stationary and it
shows<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> high<00:01:57.679> level<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.280> clutch<00:01:58.789> control
