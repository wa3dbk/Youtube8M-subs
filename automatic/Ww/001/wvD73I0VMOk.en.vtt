see these tilapia there anywhere from

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.539 
see these tilapia there anywhere from
about<00:04:15.299> I'd<00:04:15.870> say<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.169> pound<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.919> almost<00:04:17.340> two

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
about I'd say a pound to almost two

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.550 
about I'd say a pound to almost two
pounds<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:18.030> size<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.720> they're<00:04:19.530> very

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
pounds in size and they're very

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.589 
pounds in size and they're very
important<00:04:20.400> because<00:04:20.549> they<00:04:20.940> reproduce<00:04:21.389> every

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
important because they reproduce every

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.020 
important because they reproduce every
month<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.199> there's<00:04:22.949> probably<00:04:23.130> millions<00:04:23.669> of

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
month and there's probably millions of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.460 
month and there's probably millions of
them<00:04:24.180> in<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.419> lake<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.780> I've<00:04:24.900> been<00:04:25.020> told<00:04:25.229> by

them in the lake and I've been told by

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.120 
them in the lake and I've been told by
oh<00:04:25.500> no<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:26.820> some<00:04:27.090> years<00:04:27.419> they<00:04:27.780> get<00:04:27.870> about

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130

oh no that on some years they get about
1,200<00:04:29.130> tons<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.120> do<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.300> math<00:04:30.449> and<00:04:31.160> it's<00:04:32.160> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
1,200 tons so you do the math and it's a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.909 
1,200 tons so you do the math and it's a
