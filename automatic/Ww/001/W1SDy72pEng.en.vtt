00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
doing very well I think it's important

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
doing very well I think it's important
to<00:01:06.330> supplement<00:01:06.750> during<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> day<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.980> case

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to supplement during the day in a case

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
to supplement during the day in a case
like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.690> keep<00:01:09.900> him<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.230> his

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
like this but then to keep him with his

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.940 
like this but then to keep him with his
mom<00:01:10.650> whenever<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.680> still

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
have some of her night poops you know to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
get that gut flora that's so important

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
get that gut flora that's so important
for<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.340> development<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> reason<00:01:25.980> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
for the development and the reason I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.400 
for the development and the reason I
didn't<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.670> split<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> litter<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> keep

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
didn't just split the litter and keep

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.280 
didn't just split the litter and keep
him<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.670> her<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.120> 12<00:01:30.360> hours<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
him with her for 12 hours with the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.860 
him with her for 12 hours with the
smallest<00:01:31.620> ones<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.570> switch

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
smallest ones and then you know switch

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.560 
smallest ones and then you know switch
out<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.260> litter<00:01:34.880> throughout<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> day<00:01:36.270> every

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
out the litter throughout the day every

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.250 
out the litter throughout the day every
12<00:01:37.140> hours<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:38.820> dough<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.870> a

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
12 hours is that my dough is not a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.740 
12 hours is that my dough is not a
daytime<00:01:41.160> nurse<00:01:41.490> er<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.330> could<00:01:42.570> be

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
daytime nurse er and that could be

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
daytime nurse er and that could be
because<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.290> live<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.650> Georgia<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.340> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
because we live in Georgia and it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.750 
because we live in Georgia and it's
summer<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.870> it's<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.140> hot<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.860> she<00:01:47.610> only

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
summer so it's very hot here she only

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.390 
summer so it's very hot here she only
gets<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> nest<00:01:48.570> box<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:49.080> night<00:01:49.370> so<00:01:50.370> I

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
gets in the nest box at night so I

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.800 
gets in the nest box at night so I
couldn't<00:01:50.760> split<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.300> litter

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
couldn't split the litter

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140 
couldn't split the litter
I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> methods<00:01:53.340> working<00:01:53.730> out<00:01:53.850> very

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
I think this methods working out very

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.110 
I think this methods working out very
well<00:01:54.240> he's<00:01:54.750> strong<00:01:55.170> he's<00:01:55.620> growing<00:01:56.250> he's

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
well he's strong he's growing he's

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.860 
well he's strong he's growing he's
filling<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.760> in<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.940> morning<00:02:00.330> he<00:02:00.360> often

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
filling out and in the morning he often

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.110 
filling out and in the morning he often
has<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.040> belly<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.700> he's

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
has a bit of a belly so I know he's

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.660 
has a bit of a belly so I know he's
getting<00:02:03.330> from<00:02:03.690> mothers<00:02:04.040> maybe<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.520> as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
getting from mothers maybe just not as

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.850 
getting from mothers maybe just not as
much<00:02:05.940> as<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.330> other<00:02:06.480> kids<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
much as the other kids because he is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
much as the other kids because he is
smaller<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.569> he's<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.800> excited<00:02:10.979> about

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
smaller and he's so excited about

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.190 
smaller and he's so excited about
getting<00:02:12.140> his<00:02:13.140> bottle<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.879> were<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.330> still

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
getting his bottle as it were I still

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
getting his bottle as it were I still
find<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.099> syringe<00:02:17.519> works<00:02:17.790> best<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.239> me

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
find that the syringe works best for me

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690 
find that the syringe works best for me
I've<00:02:19.170> tried<00:02:19.440> him<00:02:19.799> on<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.159> of<00:02:20.190> those<00:02:20.370> little

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
I've tried him on one of those little

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.190 
I've tried him on one of those little
bottles<00:02:20.909> that<00:02:21.269> comes<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> kit<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
bottles that comes with the kit and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.490 
bottles that comes with the kit and
replace<00:02:22.620> her<00:02:22.860> milk<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.209> he<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.200> doesn't

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
replace her milk and he just doesn't

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.300 
replace her milk and he just doesn't
quite<00:02:25.680> get<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
quite get it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.220 
quite get it
I<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> nipple<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.390> still<00:02:27.690> too<00:02:27.959> big<00:02:28.200> for

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I think the nipple is still too big for

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.979 
I think the nipple is still too big for
him<00:02:28.650> maybe<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.190> he's<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.400> little<00:02:29.700> older<00:02:30.120> he'll

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
him maybe when he's a little older he'll

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.440 
him maybe when he's a little older he'll
be<00:02:31.170> ready<00:02:31.379> for<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.670> syringe<00:02:33.060> works

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
be ready for that but this syringe works

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.920 
be ready for that but this syringe works
just<00:02:33.870> fine<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.170> us<00:02:34.970> always<00:02:35.970> hold<00:02:36.480> him<00:02:36.599> upright

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
just fine for us always hold him upright

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.990 
just fine for us always hold him upright
so<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:37.560> doesn't<00:02:37.799> get<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.250> into<00:02:38.430> his<00:02:38.700> lungs

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
so that he doesn't get it into his lungs

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.520 
so that he doesn't get it into his lungs
