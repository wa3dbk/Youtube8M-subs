hey<00:00:02.250> guys<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:03.710> downloaded<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.859> new<00:00:04.890> mod<00:00:05.460> it's<00:00:06.200> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hey guys I downloaded a new mod it's the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.540 
hey guys I downloaded a new mod it's the
bacteria<00:00:08.130> mod<00:00:08.599> it's<00:00:09.599> pretty<00:00:09.870> cool<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
bacteria mod it's pretty cool and I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.690 
bacteria mod it's pretty cool and I
figured<00:00:11.969> out<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.700> replacer

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
figured out how to get the replacer

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.630 
figured out how to get the replacer
block<00:00:14.969> replace<00:00:15.570> water<00:00:15.949> but<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.070> couldn't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
block replace water but I couldn't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.700 
block replace water but I couldn't
figure<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.840> bacteria<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
figure out how to get the bacteria to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.849 
figure out how to get the bacteria to
heat<00:00:19.920> water<00:00:20.869> because<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.020> couldn't<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.560> get

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
heat water because I couldn't really get

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.089 
heat water because I couldn't really get
the<00:00:23.010> redstone<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.760> power<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.890> inside<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the redstone to power it inside the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.179 
the redstone to power it inside the
water<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.599> built<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.349> thing<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
water so I built this little thing and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.340 
water so I built this little thing and
show<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> how<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> make<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:35.780> get<00:00:36.780> some<00:00:37.079> light

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
show you how to make it get some light

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
show you how to make it get some light
here<00:00:40.010> there<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.149> three

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
here there you go and it's just three

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.340 
here there you go and it's just three
blocks<00:00:45.960> wide<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.390> basically<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
blocks wide you can basically do it with

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
blocks wide you can basically do it with
any<00:00:49.590> block<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> glass<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
any block I like do a glass because I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.670 
any block I like do a glass because I
have<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.199> cool<00:00:52.699> check<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.680> cool

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
texture pack all right you have to do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.679 
texture pack all right you have to do
this<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> water<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> have

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

this out over the water so if you have
to<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.450> just<00:01:09.450> boy<00:01:09.720> some<00:01:09.930> blocks<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.680> get

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to know just just boy some blocks to get

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
to know just just boy some blocks to get
to<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> you're<00:01:14.760> gonna<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:17.299> this<00:01:24.560> there

but I mean you can just use 5 i've just
found<00:01:47.070> sevens<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.030> easier<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:53.990> my<00:01:54.990> phone's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
found sevens a lot easier to my phone's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.670

going to i use and you basically put two
underneath<00:02:02.250> those<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.790> blocks<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
underneath those two blocks and then you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
underneath those two blocks and then you
put<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:06.259> there<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:09.629> then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
place your purple block right there

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.910 
place your purple block right there
and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:14.000> place<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.020> redstone<00:02:15.440> torch<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and then place the redstone torch in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.980 
and then place the redstone torch in
front<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.900> travels<00:02:18.500> from<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:19.990> to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
front of it and it travels from there to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.050 
front of it and it travels from there to
that<00:02:21.140> block<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.410> water<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:22.400> those<00:02:22.580> blocks<00:02:22.820> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
that block of water to those blocks of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:36.130 
that block of water to those blocks of
water<00:02:23.950> down<00:02:24.950> into<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.990> water<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.720> doesn't

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
water down into that water it doesn't

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.780 
water down into that water it doesn't
die<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.590> fast<00:02:41.800> why<00:02:42.800> back<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.460> little

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
die very fast why back here is a little

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.130 
die very fast why back here is a little
stubborn<00:02:45.970> there<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.570> that's<00:02:47.930> what

stubborn there we go and that's what
happened<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.710> overhear<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:50.150> wouldn't

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
happened to overhear it just wouldn't

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.040 
happened to overhear it just wouldn't
die<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:53.020> works<00:02:54.020> pretty<00:02:54.830> well<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:56.050> I'm

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
sure there are more efficient ways of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.680
