00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.049
 Welcome to your recycling channel 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.230
 paper and cardboard welcome to the channel 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.230
 Sun 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.610
 hello friends the list of the material is the 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.170
 I leave in the information box 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.260
 look what I got 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.360
 a dry branch full of leaves and also 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 this piece of cardboard tube that I cut 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.850
 wrong and was about to throw it away 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.430
 let's see what we can do with this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.320
 to start order a napkin half 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.140
 padded with glue to the tube 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.739
 cardboard on top of small sheets with 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.739
 silicone yes with hot silicone on top 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.140
 of the cool glue this occurred to me 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.690
 to hydrate the dried leaves that already 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.030
 They were about the break also will 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.610
 I put glue on top of the leaves and if 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.440
 it worked for me they hydrated to be able 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 work with them 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.420
 I put a layer of napkin on top 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.369
 for more protection and paint the sides 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.340
 of the leaves with a mixture of coffee and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.750
 Water 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.750
 I put two beds 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.189
 ah 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.670
 I gave a layer of yellow paint to the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.310
 leaves just you and I know that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.310
 down there are natural leaves 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.220
 and then with a thin brush and coffee 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.350
 in water accentuates some ribs of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.040
 the leaves and I tell him another layer with 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.040
 yellow paint 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.409
 why 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.310
 when competing green and orange 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 with very liquid paint and removing the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.510
 excess with a napkin 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.090
 then I accentuated the edges again 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.090
 with yellow paint 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.409
 now to row that the whole contour of 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.439
 the leaves with black paint the line 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.060
 It must be thick and blurred without touching 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.060
 the inner edge of the leaves 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.080
 be very careful with the pulse of maraquero 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.080
 Hey 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.830
 the stems I painted them with gold we sharpened 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.070
 The details let dry and varnish masters 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.020
 with two layers the reverse of the tile 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.020
 I painted black and varnish and also 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.819
 it only remains to put a wire to hang 

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:42.169
 and ready they like it as much as I do 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.169
 we see in the next video 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:06.009

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:09.909
