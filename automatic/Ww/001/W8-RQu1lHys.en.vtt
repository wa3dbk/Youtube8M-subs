I know exactly what the anthropic
principle<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.520> bullshit<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:53.260> come<00:02:53.440> on

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560

explain<00:02:54.340> things<00:02:54.610> correctly<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.480> simply<00:02:56.130> we

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
explain things correctly and simply we

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.500 
explain things correctly and simply we
don't<00:02:57.220> need<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.489> hear<00:02:57.640> more<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.850> your<00:02:57.910> stupid

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
don't need to hear more of your stupid

don't need to hear more of your stupid
non<00:02:58.750> sequitur<00:02:59.290> analogies<00:02:59.830> okay<00:03:00.640> then<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.360> it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
non sequitur analogies okay then here it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.020 
non sequitur analogies okay then here it
goes<00:03:01.739> basically<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> theory<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
goes basically this is a theory that the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.490 
goes basically this is a theory that the
universe<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.750> way<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.170> right<00:03:05.440> now

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
universe is the way it is right now

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
universe is the way it is right now
simply<00:03:06.160> because<00:03:06.459> human<00:03:06.850> beings<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:07.420> observe

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
simply because human beings can observe

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.420 
simply because human beings can observe
it<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.080> determine<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.830> was<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.130> way<00:03:09.280> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it and determine that it was that way it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.370 
it and determine that it was that way it
is

how about I observed therefore the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
how about I observed therefore the
universe<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.920> or<00:03:16.920> something<00:03:17.250> along<00:03:17.430> those
