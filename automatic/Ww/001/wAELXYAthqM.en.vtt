00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
Bobby

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
Bobby
very<00:00:33.360> similar<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> corn<00:00:34.110> syrup<00:00:34.730> yeah

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
very similar to corn syrup yeah

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.799 
very similar to corn syrup yeah
so<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> doesn't<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.250> much<00:00:38.809> healthy

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so it doesn't have as much healthy

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
so it doesn't have as much healthy
properties<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.129> you've<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
properties if you get it if you've got a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
properties if you get it if you've got a
lot<00:00:41.760> hunting<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.629> quite<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.899> few<00:00:42.989> healthy

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I buy a squeeze bottle and I take their

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.069 
I buy a squeeze bottle and I take their
long<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.239> these<00:01:00.239> although<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.870> say

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
long they want these although they say

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
long they want these although they say
organics<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.800> don't<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.670> source

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
organics they don't like this one source

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
organics they don't like this one source
organic<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.449> doesn't<00:01:03.750> say<00:01:03.899> Roja<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.920> at

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
organic it doesn't say Roja and look at

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.660 
organic it doesn't say Roja and look at
the<00:01:05.489> difference<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.490> need

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the difference and this is that you need

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
the difference and this is that you need
brown<00:01:14.939> rice<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.360> we're<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
brown rice these we're gonna make the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
brown rice these we're gonna make the
rice<00:01:16.110> krispies<00:01:16.500> treats<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.040> Lucy<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
rice krispies treats right Lucy the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
rice krispies treats right Lucy the
ground<00:01:17.960> okay<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.570> replacement<00:01:21.990> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
ground okay so this is a replacement for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
ground okay so this is a replacement for
anything<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.700> pulse<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.119> corn<00:01:24.360> syrup<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
anything that pulse with corn syrup and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
anything that pulse with corn syrup and
see<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.430> even<00:01:26.700> gonna<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
see how like if you're even gonna make a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
see how like if you're even gonna make a
pecan<00:01:27.420> pie<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.869> how<00:01:28.020> thick<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pecan pie see how thick I get this so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399 
pecan pie see how thick I get this so
that<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:32.070> pour<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that you can pour it we put it into a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.609 
that you can pour it we put it into a
container<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.670> hot<00:01:35.700> lumber<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
container with hot lumber and then it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
container with hot lumber and then it
just<00:01:37.890> makes<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.119> easy<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.570> if

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
just makes it so it's very easy for if

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.399 
just makes it so it's very easy for if
not<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.470> big<00:01:40.680> glutinous<00:01:41.420> okay<00:01:42.420> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
not it's like this big glutinous okay so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
not it's like this big glutinous okay so
this<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.159> need<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.960> free-range<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this this we need to get free-range that
