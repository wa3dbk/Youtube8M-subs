 hello my name is solange maldonado and this 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.350
 it's another video of interpretation of 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:33.080
 model and demystifying this in some 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 details that occur in the pants 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:45.230

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.280
 For you, it's the style of pants and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 mainly the coast is 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.740
 remembering that whoever is wearing these 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.600
 causes have the perfect body are 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.170
 mannequins is what happens in the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.100
 their bodies are happening 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.810
 will also happen at na in person 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 like an ordinary woman 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:22.240
 ok this is a skinny pants right well 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:25.310
 It's stuck tight to the body, so I 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.719
 I'll show you guys here, look, let me 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 see how I can do this 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:35.990
 It's better to fit here and look 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.159
 in front of the trousers dressed tightly 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.179
 on body 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.049
 this pants she is modeled on the dummy 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:47.659
 of wafer having legs then pulling 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.399
 for the front side by shooting in the front 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.219
 we pull the coast and get 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.319
 cause the butt stay well 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.069
 set you can make the 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.700
 pants are seen as a glove at a 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:09.500
 extremely tight pants and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.790
 You do not have to have strech now. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.459
 we'll see another pants ever 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.670
 Longer straighter I've already come straight to the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.950
 butt look here look at such little pebbles 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.370
 No, what happens and what is the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.260
 horror net all modeli be but 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.959
 Is it that I take those little prongs as it is 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.659
 that I do not do it because if 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.049
 modeling is wide 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:43.010
 these rules will exist may be that 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.799
 be minimized by the biotype of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.670
 who invests for example the people who 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:54.579
 He has a very pronounced butt that he has 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.500
 a sort of lordosis in the spine is 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.890
 these people are going to wear better 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.280
 these causes because it will will pull to 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.609
 up then and if those little prongs 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.269
 they are not so evident 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.790
 Here I am going to show you the side of the coast. 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:19.250
 huh 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:21.890
 let's see what looks forward to a pair of pants 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.799
 it is easier to see that even in the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.290
 in front of her she gives a certain movement she has 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.620
 an excess of tissue is due to the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.200
 modeling the model is not error 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.440
 we have to learn to detect the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.730
 what is error and what comes from the model what is 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.739
 movement of this has been another 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.129
 pants pants flex 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.609
 It's here and I think we have it 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.030
 who on the side looks at the pebbles 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.450
 inevitable 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.450
 looks 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.840
 that front is already a pair of pants 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.270
 fitted at the waist then 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.730
 here it no longer has the volume of tissue 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.930
 The volume of having been hers is to the bar. 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.650
 below the knee 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:21.530

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.840
 made and are pants decrif This is a 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.000
 pants the maple with jeans is blue 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.630
 I'll tell you what the others are. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.950
 also for you to see that you do not 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.990
 it's anything I'm showing 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.140
 on here 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.080
 this one is a cause of win beckham 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:49.160

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 it is semi bag né was formerly bag né 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.780
 today she is a pants I forgot the name 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.980
 of this pants sincerity 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:05.360
 this one is already a right of skinny jeans 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:08.930
 Serious FOTA are then shaped trousers 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.310
 where you can see that there is 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.280
 to such a little thing in the wider pants 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.150
 so we'll stick around I'll 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.930
 leave with that image and let's 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:33.169
 try to understand what is defective 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:35.750
 what it is I detail is the result of 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.840
 shape chosen for the part 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.890
 and also what some movement wants 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.310
 some people move a body to 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.040
 see in the mirror is the coast part and there 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.710
 talk but I know you're doing not her 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.970
 she moved the rotational part of the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.790
 body and there in the mirror appeared some 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:03.230
 thing that when English is 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:06.560
 invested, then it's good to have 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.870
 This is the understanding and know that 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.669
 there you are producing a pants she 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.720
 looks like this 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.240
 you are not 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.600
 she's never mad because if I 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.100
 You 're already here, I'm going to fall into my pants. 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.780
 skinny right 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.910
 so if I just want to 'I have to 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.570

 You can take advantage of this. 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.090
 knowledge that we can exchange 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.940
