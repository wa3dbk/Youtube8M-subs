all<00:01:29.030> right<00:01:29.270> let's<00:01:29.570> get<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.899> I<00:01:29.929> think<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.229> might

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
all right let's get to I think I might

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.859 
all right let's get to I think I might
use<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.679> option<00:01:30.920> guess<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.030> looks<00:01:32.060> more<00:01:32.329> sexy

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
use this option guess it looks more sexy

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.599 
use this option guess it looks more sexy
and<00:01:33.679> let's<00:01:33.920> take<00:01:34.039> a<00:01:34.130> quick<00:01:34.310> look<00:01:34.399> at<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
and let's take a quick look at the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:35.410 
and let's take a quick look at the
monitor<00:01:35.030> right

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
monitor right

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.440 
monitor right
so<00:01:36.100> without<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.429> monitor<00:01:37.759> I<00:01:37.999> mean<00:01:38.299> without

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
so without the monitor I mean without

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.969 
so without the monitor I mean without
the<00:01:38.600> privacy<00:01:39.170> screen<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.499> looks<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:39.770> this

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
the privacy screen it looks like this

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.580 
the privacy screen it looks like this
swampy<00:01:40.609> filter<00:01:41.329> from<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.539> side<00:01:41.840> about<00:01:42.079> 45

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
swampy filter from the side about 45

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.679 
swampy filter from the side about 45
degrees<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.520> anybody<00:01:43.999> can<00:01:44.119> see<00:01:44.359> what<00:01:44.539> you're

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
degrees so anybody can see what you're

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.779 
degrees so anybody can see what you're
working<00:01:44.960> on<00:01:45.319> so<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.399> don't<00:01:46.520> want<00:01:46.700> them

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
working on so you don't want them

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.139 
working on so you don't want them
stealing<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.420> proprietary<00:01:48.259> information<00:01:49.149> so

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
stealing a proprietary information so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.940 
stealing a proprietary information so
from<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.079> side<00:01:51.350> right<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:51.939> 45<00:01:52.939> degrees<00:01:53.950> okay

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
from the side right here 45 degrees okay

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.069 
from the side right here 45 degrees okay
so<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:55.460> let's<00:01:55.729> apply<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:55.969> privacy<00:01:56.780> filter

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
so now let's apply the privacy filter

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.010 
so now let's apply the privacy filter
and<00:01:57.289> see<00:01:57.560> if<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:58.639> actually<00:01:58.670> works<00:02:01.749> okay<00:02:02.749> so<00:02:02.780> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
and see if it actually works okay so I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.940 
and see if it actually works okay so I
change<00:02:03.350> my<00:02:03.530> mind

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
change my mind

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.219 
change my mind
I<00:02:04.039> might<00:02:04.639> actually<00:02:04.700> use<00:02:05.060> option<00:02:05.420> 2<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.630> use<00:02:06.079> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
I might actually use option 2 I use the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.169 
I might actually use option 2 I use the
side<00:02:06.439> tabs<00:02:06.770> guess<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.700> don't<00:02:07.819> want<00:02:07.969> to<00:02:08.030> use

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
side tabs guess I don't want to use

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.509 
side tabs guess I don't want to use
these<00:02:08.450> strips<00:02:09.050> which<00:02:09.410> will<00:02:09.649> interfere<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.280> my

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
these strips which will interfere of my

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.210 
these strips which will interfere of my
viewing<00:02:11.110> because<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.590> stick<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.040> to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
viewing because you just stick it to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
viewing because you just stick it to
there<00:02:13.400> and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
there and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.059 
there and
we'll<00:02:13.959> definitely<00:02:14.080> interview<00:02:14.739> while<00:02:15.040> I
