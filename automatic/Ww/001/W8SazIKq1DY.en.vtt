the<00:00:14.340> offseason<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:15.179> preseason<00:00:15.690> pose<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859

Heisman<00:00:17.039> watch<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> everything<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.660> for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
Heisman watch and everything but for

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
Heisman watch and everything but for
some<00:00:19.680> reason<00:00:20.070> every<00:00:20.250> time<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.430> put<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> clip

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
some reason every time I put that clip

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
some reason every time I put that clip
in<00:00:21.119> Sony<00:00:21.390> Vegas<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.140> stops<00:00:22.470> working<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
in Sony Vegas it stops working so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
in Sony Vegas it stops working so
basically<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> can't<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.119> clip<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
basically I can't get that clip but the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.009 
basically I can't get that clip but the
main<00:00:24.990> points<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.970> was<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.000> Jason<00:00:27.630> Reed

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
main points of that was that Jason Reed

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
main points of that was that Jason Reed
is<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> Heisman<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.880> he's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is up there for the Heisman I think he's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.020 
is up there for the Heisman I think he's
actually<00:00:30.179> number<00:00:30.660> 3<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.309> organ<00:00:32.309> goes<00:00:32.550> into

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually number 3 and organ goes into

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
actually number 3 and organ goes into
this<00:00:33.510> season<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> second<00:00:34.800> ranked<00:00:35.070> team<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and Rick mosses second year and I think

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.959
