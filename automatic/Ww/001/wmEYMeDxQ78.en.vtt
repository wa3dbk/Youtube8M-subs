00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
really really have to simply because

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.090 
really really have to simply because
most<00:01:12.689> paranoid<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.860> rubber

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
most paranoid that's just a rubber

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
most paranoid that's just a rubber
tingle<00:01:14.430> fall<00:01:14.640> off<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:16.140> retainer

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
tingle fall off and then your retainer

the sticks can bend this is what I'm

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.759

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
and yeah I personally don't really like

and yeah I personally don't really like
wearing<00:02:38.569> these<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.319> when<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.040> tighten

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
wearing these because when you tighten

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.300 
wearing these because when you tighten
them<00:02:40.639> the<00:02:41.150> bar<00:02:41.540> kind<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.989> twists<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.129> so

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
them the bar kind of twists with it so

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.589 
them the bar kind of twists with it so
it's<00:02:43.459> really<00:02:43.579> hard<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:43.939> tell<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.420> whether

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
it's really hard to tell in whether

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.229 
it's really hard to tell in whether
they're<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:45.400> perfectly<00:02:46.400> screwed<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.970> or

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
they're actually perfectly screwed on or

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.000 
they're actually perfectly screwed on or
not<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.780> yeah<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.409> like<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> really<00:02:48.859> like

way<00:04:13.609> to<00:04:13.669> keep<00:04:13.970> out<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.389> sentimental<00:04:14.959> value

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
way to keep out of sentimental value

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.009 
way to keep out of sentimental value
because<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.489> was<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.820> one<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.359> my<00:04:17.599> piercing

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
because it was the one that my piercing

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.839 
because it was the one that my piercing
healed<00:04:18.289> with<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.680> was<00:04:18.859> one<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.310> got<00:04:19.489> put<00:04:19.729> in

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849

healed with it was one that got put in
there<00:04:20.090> after<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.570> appears<00:04:21.610> so<00:04:22.610> yeah<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.090> is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
there after it appears so yeah it is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.060 
there after it appears so yeah it is
really<00:04:23.570> really<00:04:23.900> long<00:04:24.080> like<00:04:24.380> compared<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.039> a

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
really really long like compared to a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.610 
really really long like compared to a
regular

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
regular

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.610 
regular
Bar<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.340> really<00:04:26.729> long<00:04:27.229> but<00:04:28.229> yeah<00:04:28.500> I'm<00:04:28.590> just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
Bar is really long but yeah I'm just

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.080 
Bar is really long but yeah I'm just
keeping<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.130> because<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.460> was<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.669> first<00:04:29.880> one

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
keeping it because it was the first one

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.689 
keeping it because it was the first one
and<00:04:30.449> lastly<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.380> have<00:04:31.500> three<00:04:31.919> with<00:04:32.130> James<00:04:32.370> well

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
and lastly I have three with James well

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.040 
and lastly I have three with James well
this<00:04:32.850> one<00:04:33.060> doesn't<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.510> gym<00:04:33.720> anymore

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
this one doesn't have a gym anymore

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.770 
this one doesn't have a gym anymore
because<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.380> sellouts<00:04:34.740> but<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.400> know<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
because it sellouts but you know I

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.879 
because it sellouts but you know I
should<00:04:36.780> probably<00:04:36.810> throw<00:04:37.199> away<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.740> can

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
should probably throw away but I can

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.370 
should probably throw away but I can
maybe<00:04:38.460> still<00:04:38.850> use<00:04:39.090> D<00:04:39.360> well<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.110> definitely

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
maybe still use D well I can definitely

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.320 
maybe still use D well I can definitely
still<00:04:40.560> use<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.280> ball<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:41.760> probably<00:04:42.000> take<00:04:42.270> it

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
still use the ball so I probably take it

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.939 
still use the ball so I probably take it
up<00:04:42.510> then<00:04:43.050> there's<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.380> one<00:04:43.620> which<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:43.919> think

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
up then there's this one which I think

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.360 
up then there's this one which I think
looks<00:04:44.430> really<00:04:44.520> really<00:04:45.210> cool<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:46.070> haven't<00:04:47.070> worn

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370

it yet so I don't know how comfortable
this<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.340> points<00:04:50.669> will<00:04:50.790> be<00:04:50.910> but<00:04:51.870> yeah<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.500> just

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
this the points will be but yeah I just

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.680

things just a lot of nature took the gym

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.580 
things just a lot of nature took the gym
to<00:05:03.150> fall<00:05:03.360> off<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.840> wear<00:05:03.990> them<00:05:04.139> for<00:05:04.289> too<00:05:04.410> long

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
to fall off if I wear them for too long

to fall off if I wear them for too long
so<00:05:05.120> yeah<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:06.330> anyways<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.900> do<00:05:06.960> really<00:05:07.229> love<00:05:07.680> the
