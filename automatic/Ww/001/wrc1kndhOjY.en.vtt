and<00:00:03.810> we<00:00:04.080> did<00:00:04.230> some<00:00:04.259> benchmark<00:00:04.529> testing<00:00:05.250> on

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
and we did some benchmark testing on

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.710 
and we did some benchmark testing on
this<00:00:05.580> device<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.120> going<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> show<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.509> the

the chrome scores generally stay

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.750 
the chrome scores generally stay
constant<00:00:18.359> across<00:00:18.890> devices<00:00:19.890> if<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> same

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
to and to do out here one of the most

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
to and to do out here one of the most
popular<00:00:27.119> benchmark<00:00:27.630> scores<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.199> there<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
popular benchmark scores and there you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.849 
popular benchmark scores and there you
can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.619> its<00:00:28.890> course<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> top<00:00:30.859> much

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
can see its course right on the top much

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.540 
can see its course right on the top much
above<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> s5<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> no<00:00:33.660> trees<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.550> z2

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
above the s5 and no trees and even z2

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
above the s5 and no trees and even z2
and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.890> we<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.390> tree<00:00:39.690> d<00:00:40.430> mark

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and then we have what the tree d mark

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.750 
and then we have what the tree d mark
scores<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.760> they<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.030> maxes<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:46.399> in<00:00:47.399> ice

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
scores and they see it maxes out in ice

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.220 
scores and they see it maxes out in ice
storm<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.780> Strom<00:00:49.079> extreme<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.280> 8,500

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
storm in I Strom extreme also it's 8,500

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.549 
storm in I Strom extreme also it's 8,500
double<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.789> when<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.260> compare<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
double it and when you compare to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
double it and when you compare to the
high<00:00:55.770> scores<00:00:56.219> possible<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.090> G<00:00:57.480> flex<00:00:57.840> as

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
high scores possible they see G flex as

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
high scores possible they see G flex as
a<00:00:58.109> high<00:00:58.350> square<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:58.800> 10,000<00:00:59.480> something<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a high square about 10,000 something so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 
a high square about 10,000 something so
it's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.190> verified<00:01:02.190> could<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.609> about<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.149> 15th

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's not verified could be about in 15th

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's not verified could be about in 15th
in<00:01:03.960> line<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> ice<00:01:05.820> dome

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in line and then we have ice dome

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
in line and then we have ice dome
unlimited<00:01:06.840> which<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.100> most

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
unlimited which is like the most

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.840 
unlimited which is like the most
intensive<00:01:09.260> indents<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.470> tests<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.700> we

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
intensive indents of tests and then we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
intensive indents of tests and then we
have<00:01:12.060> their<00:01:12.330> 14,000<00:01:13.140> 94<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:15.330> falls<00:01:15.750> really

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
have their 14,000 94 it falls really

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910 
have their 14,000 94 it falls really
behind<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.710> very

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
behind you know some of the very very

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
behind you know some of the very very
popular<00:01:20.369> flagship<00:01:21.270> devices<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.080> basically

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
popular flagship devices and basically

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
popular flagship devices and basically
tablets<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> shield<00:01:24.240> after

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
tablets so you have the shield after

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160 
tablets so you have the shield after
thirty<00:01:24.869> thousand<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.710> by<00:01:25.950> 35,000<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
thirty thousand me by 35,000 and so on

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520 
thirty thousand me by 35,000 and so on
twenty<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.530> thousand<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:31.079> did<00:01:31.290> some

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
twenty one thousand and then we did some

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
twenty one thousand and then we did some
value<00:01:32.130> more<00:01:32.280> testing<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.659> see

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
value more testing and you see

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.980 
value more testing and you see
multi-core<00:01:34.560> metal<00:01:35.159> testing<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.450> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
multi-core metal testing out there we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
multi-core metal testing out there we
did<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.100> browser<00:01:38.369> testing<00:01:38.790> again<00:01:39.060> for

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
did not do the browser testing again for

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
did not do the browser testing again for
the<00:01:39.329> same<00:01:39.570> reason<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:40.110> before<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:41.100> multi-core

then metal scoring again it tops then we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.289 
then metal scoring again it tops then we

have your base mark exco 12,000 913 and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.620 
have your base mark exco 12,000 913 and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you see when a blue top ten twelve

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.450 
you see when a blue top ten twelve
thousand<00:02:04.049> nine<00:02:04.229> hundred<00:02:04.560> and

they<00:02:06.060> fall<00:02:06.510> slightly<00:02:06.780> short<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.399> top

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they fall slightly short because the top

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.530 
they fall slightly short because the top
devices<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.660> scores<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> exist<00:02:11.250> of

30,000 and see out there then these are
the<00:02:15.780> base<00:02:15.990> mark<00:02:16.319> 20<00:02:16.950> s<00:02:17.400> 2<00:02:17.670> scores<00:02:18.060> overall<00:02:18.770> 978

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
the base mark 20 s 2 scores overall 978

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.380 
the base mark 20 s 2 scores overall 978
and<00:02:21.410> i<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.400> i<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> comparison

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and i don't think i have the comparison

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.870 
and i don't think i have the comparison
for<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.620> even<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.130> actually<00:02:26.640> fall

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
for that and so even this actually fall

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.600 
for that and so even this actually fall
short<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> goes<00:02:27.750> out<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.350> top<00:02:28.560> 10<00:02:28.890> so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
short and it goes out of the top 10 so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.090 
short and it goes out of the top 10 so
base<00:02:29.880> marks<00:02:30.239> course<00:02:30.540> every<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.739> much

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
base marks course every is not much

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.780 
base marks course every is not much
