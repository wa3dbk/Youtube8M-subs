so<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> SD<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:27.689> client<00:01:28.229> speeds<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.009> max

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so the SD make client speeds the max

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.789 
so the SD make client speeds the max
clients<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.750> join<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> server<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
clients that can join the server at the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.550 
clients that can join the server at the
same<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> V<00:01:33.540> makes<00:01:33.840> clients<00:01:34.350> per

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
same time and this V makes clients per

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.100 
same time and this V makes clients per

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
server or ID and of course server sorry

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
server or ID and of course server sorry
next<00:01:38.100> client<00:01:38.610> steps<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> join<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
next client steps you can join in the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.609 
next client steps you can join in the
same<00:01:40.500> IP<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.159> normally<00:01:41.970> people<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.470> not

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
same IP so normally people use to do not

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.670 
same IP so normally people use to do not
use<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:46.140> people<00:01:46.500> have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
use one because you some people have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.350 
use one because you some people have
borders<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> put<00:01:48.240> together

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
borders and they want to put together

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.710 
borders and they want to put together
and<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.530> can't<00:01:49.799> give<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.759> value<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.420> one

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and they can't give this value like one

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.700 
and they can't give this value like one
so<00:01:52.399> try<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.240> least<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:55.170> SP<00:01:55.500> register

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so try to use to at least be SP register

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.670 
so try to use to at least be SP register
is<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.880> most<00:01:57.090> important<00:01:57.570> problem<00:01:57.899> but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
is like the most important problem but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
is like the most important problem but
you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> server

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you know if you want to make the server

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
you know if you want to make the server
online<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.259> offline<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.759> would<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
online or offline so if you would make a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.310 
online or offline so if you would make a
lens<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
lens over you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
lens over you
spirit<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:05.010> certain<00:02:05.400> zero<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.120> want<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
spirit is certain zero if you want to
