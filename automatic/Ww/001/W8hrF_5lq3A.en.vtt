hard<00:04:25.490> scope<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:26.030> those<00:04:26.720> are<00:04:26.900> all<00:04:26.930> just

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
hard scope is those are all just

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.150 
hard scope is those are all just
techniques<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:28.010> know<00:04:28.100> you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
techniques that you can you know you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.770 
techniques that you can you know you

permit fee I'll of the breath 50 Cal I

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.550 
permit fee I'll of the breath 50 Cal I
also<00:04:35.330> use<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.600> intervention<00:04:36.080> by<00:04:36.200> recently

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
also use the intervention by recently

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.410 
also use the intervention by recently
just<00:04:36.650> got<00:04:36.710> fall<00:04:37.070> for<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.820> decided<00:04:38.330> to

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
just got fall for it so I decided to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.860 
just got fall for it so I decided to
move<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.260> bread<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:40.520> I'm<00:04:41.510> really

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
move on to the bread and I'm really

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.940 
move on to the bread and I'm really
liking<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.170> bread<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.500> because<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.800> has<00:04:42.920> a

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
liking the bread just because it has a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.970 
liking the bread just because it has a
tent<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.910> has<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> kind<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.870> faster<00:04:45.230> ABS<00:04:45.590> aim

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
tent it has a kind of a faster ABS aim

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.530 
tent it has a kind of a faster ABS aim
down<00:04:46.190> sight<00:04:46.520> when<00:04:46.790> you're<00:04:46.910> going<00:04:47.180> against

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
down sight when you're going against

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.750 
down sight when you're going against
with<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.800> know<00:04:48.890> other<00:04:49.040> snipers<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.550> other

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
with you know other snipers and other

with you know other snipers and other
you<00:04:50.240> know<00:04:50.300> users<00:04:50.750> compared<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.680> the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
you know users compared to the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.590 
you know users compared to the
intervention<00:04:52.070> where<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.240> pretty<00:04:53.390> fast

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
intervention where it's a pretty fast

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.780 
intervention where it's a pretty fast
80s<00:04:54.020> with<00:04:54.200> sleight<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.440> hand<00:04:54.650> pro<00:04:54.710> but<00:04:55.580> the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
80s with sleight of hand pro but the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.820 
80s with sleight of hand pro but the
bread<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.180> has<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.390> quicker<00:04:56.900> zooming<00:04:57.380> in

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
bread just has that quicker zooming in

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.200 
bread just has that quicker zooming in
the<00:04:57.980> scope<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:59.480> like<00:04:59.990> I<00:05:00.080> said<00:05:00.140> you<00:05:00.470> have<00:05:00.620> to

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
the scope so like I said you have to

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.280 
the scope so like I said you have to
with<00:05:02.210> any<00:05:02.330> sniper<00:05:02.600> you<00:05:02.780> have<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:02.990> learn<00:05:03.080> the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
with any sniper you have to learn the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.909 
with any sniper you have to learn the
role<00:05:03.500> you're<00:05:03.620> playing<00:05:03.680> as<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.850> know

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
role you're playing as a you know

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.129 
role you're playing as a you know
of<00:05:06.919> whether<00:05:07.220> it's<00:05:07.419> wa2000<00:05:08.419> with<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> Bret<00:05:08.990> you

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
of whether it's wa2000 with a Bret you

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.330 
of whether it's wa2000 with a Bret you
obviously<00:05:09.440> have<00:05:09.530> that<00:05:09.680> spring<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.070> need<00:05:10.220> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
obviously have that spring I need the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.879 
obviously have that spring I need the
m-21s<00:05:10.850> are<00:05:11.060> very<00:05:11.270> similar<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:12.530> can<00:05:12.650> kind<00:05:12.770> of

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
m-21s are very similar you can kind of

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.650 
m-21s are very similar you can kind of
get<00:05:13.070> with<00:05:13.370> these<00:05:13.580> two<00:05:13.730> snowmen<00:05:14.120> 21<00:05:14.540> the

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
get with these two snowmen 21 the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.730 
get with these two snowmen 21 the
barrette<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:14.990> can<00:05:15.110> kind<00:05:15.229> of<00:05:15.260> get<00:05:15.380> more<00:05:15.560> in

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
barrette you can kind of get more in

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.650 
barrette you can kind of get more in
close<00:05:15.979> quarters<00:05:16.460> just<00:05:16.639> because<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.510> have<00:05:17.600> a

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
close quarters just because you have a

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.969 
close quarters just because you have a
better<00:05:17.870> chance<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:18.290> taking<00:05:18.470> somebody<00:05:18.860> out

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
better chance of taking somebody out

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.379 
better chance of taking somebody out
then<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.340> know<00:05:19.610> maybe<00:05:19.910> something<00:05:20.210> with<00:05:20.300> an

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
then you know maybe something with an

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.370 
then you know maybe something with an
intervention<00:05:20.990> or<00:05:21.970> wa2000<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.780> course<00:05:23.990> I

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
intervention or wa2000 and of course I

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.020 
intervention or wa2000 and of course I
didn't<00:05:24.710> mention<00:05:24.830> earlier<00:05:24.979> but<00:05:25.310> my<00:05:25.460> attachment

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.490 
ground you can just see from that
example<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.700> how<00:05:58.850> ninja<00:05:59.180> pro<00:05:59.360> kid<00:05:59.870> obviously

example of how ninja pro kid obviously

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.200 
example of how ninja pro kid obviously
doesn't<00:06:01.039> make<00:06:01.130> your<00:06:01.250> accuracy<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.669> best<00:06:01.910> when

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
doesn't make your accuracy the best when

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.629 
doesn't make your accuracy the best when
at<00:06:02.479> no<00:06:02.600> scoping<00:06:03.050> even<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.410> super<00:06:04.130> close<00:06:04.310> range

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
at no scoping even a super close range

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.439 
at no scoping even a super close range
so<00:06:05.479> you<00:06:05.780> know<00:06:05.870> again<00:06:06.080> it's<00:06:06.320> really<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:08.240> last
