and knocking them down what do you think
is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.410> biggest<00:00:32.399> reason<00:00:32.790> why<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> guys<00:00:33.480> are

able<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> move<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.829> well<00:00:35.750> like<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.870> said

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
able to move them so well like I said

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.160 
able to move them so well like I said
whispering<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.710> our<00:00:37.829> spots<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.989> we<00:00:39.989> know

where<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.350> players<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.770> think<00:00:43.770> that's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
where our players are but I think that's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
where our players are but I think that's
Annie<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.309> knocking<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.670> shots<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.149> we're

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
Annie we're knocking down shots so we're

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
Annie we're knocking down shots so we're

defense<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.130> i<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.180> shot<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> fifty

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
defense at all i think they shot a fifty

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
defense at all i think they shot a fifty
percent<00:01:16.200> last<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.820> wanted<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
tonight and try to limit the heat on

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
tonight and try to limit the heat on
offensive<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> cut<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> floor

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
offensive in how did you cut the floor

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.510 
offensive in how did you cut the floor
and<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.740> them<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.369> them

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and have for them and really make them

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
and have for them and really make them
go<00:01:26.880> one-on-one<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.810> individual<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.439> opposed

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
go one-on-one be individual as opposed

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
go one-on-one be individual as opposed
to<00:01:28.829> moving<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> ball<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.460> i<00:01:29.490> decided<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to moving the ball so i decided for the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.870 
to moving the ball so i decided for the
heat<00:01:30.740> i<00:01:33.170> mean<00:01:34.170> i<00:01:34.200> guess<00:01:34.670> everybody<00:01:35.670> just

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
heat i mean i guess everybody just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840 
heat i mean i guess everybody just
buying<00:01:36.210> into<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> planning<00:01:37.640> knowing<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
buying into the planning knowing the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
buying into the planning knowing the
rotations<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.829> watching<00:01:40.829> film<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.189> their

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
rotations in watching film when their

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
rotations in watching film when their
offense<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.270> i<00:01:43.250> guess<00:01:44.250> i<00:01:44.399> said<00:01:44.689> there<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
offense and i guess i said there was a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.530 
offense and i guess i said there was a
reluctance<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.590> LeBron<00:01:46.979> do

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
reluctance from LeBron do

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.760 
reluctance from LeBron do
I<00:01:47.570> mean<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.990> seem<00:01:48.140> like<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.350> took<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.560> lot<00:01:48.740> of
