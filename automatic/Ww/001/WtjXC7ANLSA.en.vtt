horse has a lot of comfort features as
well<00:01:10.439> let's<00:01:10.770> talk<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.340> tree<00:01:11.610> yeah

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
well let's talk about that tree yeah

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
well let's talk about that tree yeah
they<00:01:12.390> took<00:01:12.570> their<00:01:12.750> original<00:01:13.200> tree<00:01:13.439> design<00:01:13.770> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they took their original tree design in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.330 
they took their original tree design in
the<00:01:13.979> generation<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:14.820> stripped<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.750> down

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the generation two stripped it down

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
the generation two stripped it down
reinforced<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.520> carbon<00:01:18.030> fiber<00:01:18.299> Kevlar

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
reinforced it with carbon fiber Kevlar

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
reinforced it with carbon fiber Kevlar
so<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> reduced<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> weight<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so it reduced a lot of the weight and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
so it reduced a lot of the weight and
gave<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.330> tensile<00:01:21.840> strength<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
gave it much more tensile strength to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
gave it much more tensile strength to
the<00:01:22.860> bottom<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.340> tree<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.759> added<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the bottom of that tree they added a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020 
the bottom of that tree they added a
poly<00:01:24.360> form<00:01:24.780> fit<00:01:25.259> bar<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> tree<00:01:26.580> actually

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
poly form fit bar so the tree actually

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
poly form fit bar so the tree actually
does<00:01:27.360> adjust<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.619> horses<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.189> some

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
does adjust to your horses back some

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.080 
does adjust to your horses back some
then<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.570> line<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.110> skirts<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.130> gel

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
then they line the skirts with a gel

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
then they line the skirts with a gel
type<00:01:33.360> material<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> helps<00:01:34.259> reduce<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
type material that helps reduce the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
type material that helps reduce the
shock<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> concussion<00:01:35.759> delivered<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
shock and concussion delivered from the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
shock and concussion delivered from the
saddle<00:01:36.659> treat<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.110> horses<00:01:37.439> back<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
saddle treat of your horses back it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.410 
saddle treat of your horses back it
sounds<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.460> they've<00:01:38.640> thought<00:01:39.270> of
