have<00:01:18.900> bet<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> flop<00:01:19.470> instead<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> trapping

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
have bet that flop instead of trapping

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.270 
have bet that flop instead of trapping
hundred<00:01:20.640> thousand<00:01:21.890> because<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:22.979> didn't<00:01:23.159> bet

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
hundred thousand because he didn't bet

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.450 
hundred thousand because he didn't bet
that<00:01:23.430> flop<00:01:23.700> he<00:01:23.850> should<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.270> call<00:01:24.509> here

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.190 

well<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:29.910> liking<00:01:30.150> his<00:01:30.420> line<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.840> hand<00:01:31.080> I

think he should have either been out on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
think he should have either been out on
the<00:01:33.270> flop<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:33.930> should<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.410> flat

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
