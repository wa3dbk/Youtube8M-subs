of amber lights to make it look good is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
of amber lights to make it look good is
that<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> can't<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.479> main<00:02:03.659> lip<00:02:03.929> color<00:02:04.170> has

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that it can't be the main lip color has

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.410 
that it can't be the main lip color has
to<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.709> be<00:02:04.770> part<00:02:05.069> of<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:05.429> eye<00:02:05.459> look<00:02:05.819> when<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that it definitely does look a little

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
that it definitely does look a little
bit<00:02:09.090> too<00:02:09.360> orange<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.350> once<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.590> that

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.930 
was really good idea but because this is
for<00:05:07.500> filming<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.099> I<00:05:08.159> really<00:05:08.490> just<00:05:08.520> want<00:05:08.880> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
for filming and I really just want the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.360 
for filming and I really just want the
lashes<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.539> stick<00:05:09.780> out<00:05:10.069> that's<00:05:11.069> why<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
lashes to stick out that's why the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.240 
lashes to stick out that's why the
makeup<00:05:11.909> is<00:05:12.060> kind<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.419> more<00:05:12.900> at<00:05:13.800> least<00:05:14.069> it's

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
makeup is kind of more at least it's

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.670 
makeup is kind of more at least it's
subtle<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:14.880> know<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.180> not<00:05:15.300> really<00:05:15.719> heavy<00:05:15.960> so

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
subtle you know it's not really heavy so

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.110 
subtle you know it's not really heavy so
this<00:05:16.800> way<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.069> lash<00:05:17.250> just<00:05:17.550> show<00:05:17.699> up<00:05:17.819> a<00:05:17.940> bit

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
this way the lash just show up a bit

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.470 
this way the lash just show up a bit
more

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.210 

I'm<00:05:25.020> just<00:05:25.170> gonna<00:05:25.260> take<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> bit<00:05:25.710> more<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:26.010> the
