actually<00:00:36.239> did<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:37.020> amount<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.380> damage<00:00:37.739> on

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
actually did a good amount of damage on

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
actually did a good amount of damage on
me<00:00:38.129> while<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> had<00:00:38.610> them<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.940> rounded<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.840> be

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
me while I had them all rounded up so be

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
me while I had them all rounded up so be
careful<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> heel<00:00:41.100> ready<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
careful and have a heel ready if you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
careful and have a heel ready if you
really<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.930> other<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> it's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
really need it but other than that it's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
really need it but other than that it's
not<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> difficult<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> goes

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
not really that difficult and it goes

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
not really that difficult and it goes
pretty<00:00:45.510> fast<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.710> anyways<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.670> gonna

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
pretty fast so anyways you're just gonna

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
pretty fast so anyways you're just gonna
simply<00:00:48.230> skin<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.530> mobs<00:00:49.920> once<00:00:50.190> they're

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
simply skin all the mobs once they're

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
simply skin all the mobs once they're
all<00:00:50.460> dead<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
all dead and this is actually the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
all dead and this is actually the
longest<00:00:52.559> part<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.270> we're

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
longest part of it as you can see we're

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
longest part of it as you can see we're
at<00:00:54.719> about<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> minute<00:00:55.410> 30<00:00:55.980> seconds<00:00:56.550> i<00:00:56.640> believe

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
at about a minute 30 seconds i believe

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
at about a minute 30 seconds i believe
it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.809> finally<00:00:58.140> killed<00:00:58.440> them<00:00:58.590> all

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it was when we finally killed them all

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
it was when we finally killed them all
and<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.949> takes<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.910> minutes<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.449> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and it takes about two minutes to just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
and it takes about two minutes to just
get<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:02.010> crazy<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
get them all so it's pretty crazy so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
get them all so it's pretty crazy so
anyways<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.049> right<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.320> my<00:01:04.860> run<00:01:05.159> time<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
anyways as of right now my run time is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.460 
anyways as of right now my run time is
right<00:01:05.820> around<00:01:05.970> 3<00:01:06.390> minutes<00:01:06.570> 30<00:01:06.930> seconds<00:01:07.409> I'm

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
right around 3 minutes 30 seconds I'm

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
right around 3 minutes 30 seconds I'm
trying<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.549> bit

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
trying to get that down a little bit

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.340 
trying to get that down a little bit
lower<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.510> sure<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.930> much<00:01:10.049> quicker

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
lower but I'm not sure how much quicker

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.399 
lower but I'm not sure how much quicker
I<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.530> actually<00:01:10.890> make<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> take<00:01:12.900> 60

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
I can actually make it so if you take 60

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
I can actually make it so if you take 60
and<00:01:13.530> divide<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:14.130> 3.5<00:01:14.760> you'll<00:01:15.000> get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and divide that by 3.5 you'll get

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.350 
and divide that by 3.5 you'll get
roughly<00:01:15.630> 17<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> amount<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> runs

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
roughly 17 which is the amount of runs

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
roughly 17 which is the amount of runs
that<00:01:18.540> you'd<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.869> able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.229> per<00:01:19.470> hour<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that you'd be able to do per hour and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
that you'd be able to do per hour and
once<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:20.909> done<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> run<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.479> simply

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
once you're done with a run just simply

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
once you're done with a run just simply
step<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> reset<00:01:23.189> instances<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
step out and do the reset instances and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
step out and do the reset instances and
it<00:01:24.180> should<00:01:24.390> reset<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> mobs<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.590> anyways

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it should reset all the mobs but anyways

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.050 
it should reset all the mobs but anyways
here<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> let's<00:01:26.490> take<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.030> our

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here we go and let's take a look at our

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
here we go and let's take a look at our
