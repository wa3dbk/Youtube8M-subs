00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.840

 this video even if you do not even want 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 it's not work when you have five 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.159
 thousand subscribers focus in beach and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.979
 when we have a hundred thousand subscribers 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.160
 we have something pretty cool it's 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.710
 attention you have occasion unheard 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.270
 good for people in quebec and not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 think you have a lot more of that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 because about every player who 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.900

 ccco citic morning in city hall office not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.750
 it's really small it may seem 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 really nothing at all for some 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.820
 people but me it's downright 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.650
 representative 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090

 more numerous if we end up 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.060
 today it's mostly to react to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.830
 my very first video that was posted 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.210
 that very day there is a name of that when 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.660
 you found I have tremendously 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 changed that at the level of the voice or the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.820
 physical at the voice level I believe 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 not because they believe me right now and 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.800
 of saving I want my hair there is a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.730
 I did not have that disgusting mouth and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.140
 it was a little bit that's not it 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 that I'm ashamed of this video but when 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.350

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.900

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.570
 very first video is too small so 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.310
 for those who do not know and I hope 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.380

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.799

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.810
 fault 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.940

 oh no no why I decided to do 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.840
 debauve jokes like that is what 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.590
 you realize what I have 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 says one of the tea time bras it's like a 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:43.850
 giant Belgian you always have never said 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.850

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 a convoy at m 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.520
 okay it's a big deal then but 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.130
 these same jokes look at how this 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.290
 kind I force myself to not say big word 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:04.050
 all right, I 'm still doing xmb 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 title in almost in fact this is a small 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.720
 little background 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.050
 so it would not bother to take it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:17.880
 and we can 2004 the value to the episode 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.320
 end at 376 or literally what is it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.930
 had to head 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:30.290
 and that's why I'm recording my 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.550
 his mayor 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.590

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.720
 stay in your place stay in your video 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.070
 to be small never comes back so 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
 this is my first reaction 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.760
 video on this youtube channel 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.020
 I do not spit any suspense 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.770
 without it I would not be here 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.880
 today so here is even if I 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.680
 crazy a bit of my mouth at the time 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.360
 here I am adept at self-mockery 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.370
 I remember that I still had 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.750
 enough worked on it even if it's not 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.980
 I was not necessarily comfortable 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.440
 in front of the camera but here I am 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.910
 still proud of what I did 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.160
 especially for this video for all 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.160
 a year that I spent with you ever 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.180
 regretted just one thing I did 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.500
 thank you so much for being here every 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.420
 days so like what you can see 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.260
 that even when one is young when one has 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.330
 a young physique 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.160
 we can still win on youtube 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.660
 I do not say I'm a star 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.180
 just people who like to do what we do 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.770
 does who likes to make videos and that's it 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.480
 so you do not stop doing 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.070
 videos because you're scared of a south 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.610
 and critical of what he will say about this 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.660
 that she will say what do you like that I 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.360
 do not say I'm the example to follow 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.740
 but I am a good good example for 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.840
 show that here we are young people 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.070
 is never taken seriously 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.020
 is not kicks or we are not 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.070
 already made a minimum of maturity 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.170
 launch you if you want to do some 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 videos whether for anything 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.200
 launch you are not afraid to tell you 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.430
 that you are too young that you are 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.810
 also that you are too that and nobody 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.090

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.390
 you do not care are you saying that precisely 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.100
 if these people there who have not done 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.140
 what would they want to 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.880
 do it because of people's eyes and 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.930

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.640
 you and all that stuff 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.770
