carrying him another way this would take

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.590 
carrying him another way this would take
more<00:03:37.110> than<00:03:37.320> split-second<00:03:38.040> timing<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:39.480> can

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
more than split-second timing as you can

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.630 
more than split-second timing as you can
see<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.230> gets<00:03:40.560> deflected<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.370> going

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
see it gets deflected and it's going

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.540 
see it gets deflected and it's going
down<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> goes<00:03:43.080> back<00:03:43.140> up<00:03:43.590> 85<00:03:44.310> is
