you<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.630> see<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.780> went<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.170> little<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
you can see I went a little over the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.110 
you can see I went a little over the
line<00:02:34.160> right<00:02:34.900> right<00:02:35.900> there<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.940> can<00:02:38.060> go

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
line right right there but you can go

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.000 
line right right there but you can go
ahead<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.270> touch<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.720> up<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:39.260> some<00:02:39.590> black

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010

paint<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:41.000> you'll<00:02:41.150> want<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.450> do<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.780> after

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
paint but you'll want to do that after

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.820
