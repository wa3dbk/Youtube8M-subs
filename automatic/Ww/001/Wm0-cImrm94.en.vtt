to let myself get carried away I have
been<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:47.630> position<00:01:47.869> before

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
been in this position before

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.740 
been in this position before
in<00:01:48.710> fact<00:01:49.250> I've<00:01:49.460> almost<00:01:49.640> I've<00:01:49.970> been<00:01:50.149> nine<00:01:50.420> laps

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
in fact I've almost I've been nine laps

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.109 
in fact I've almost I've been nine laps
from<00:01:51.020> winning<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.440> damn<00:01:52.039> thing<00:01:52.399> he<00:01:52.880> said<00:01:53.060> I'm

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
from winning this damn thing he said I'm

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.700 
from winning this damn thing he said I'm
not<00:01:53.270> going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:53.690> excited<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:54.380> yet

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
not going to get excited just yet

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.990 
not going to get excited just yet
well<00:01:54.950> he's<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.100> tenth<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.520> second<00:01:55.850> slower

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
well he's a tenth of a second slower

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.400 
well he's a tenth of a second slower
than<00:01:56.330> long<00:01:56.479> has<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.929> top<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.259> hill

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
than long has to the top of the hill

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.250 
than long has to the top of the hill
then<00:01:57.530> puts<00:01:57.709> it<00:01:57.800> 410<00:01:58.310> slower<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.880> sky

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
then puts it 410 slower the sky

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.050 
then puts it 410 slower the sky
the<00:01:59.410> same<00:01:59.590> point<00:01:59.830> this<00:02:00.520> guy<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.820> looking

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
the same point this guy is looking

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.910 
the same point this guy is looking
pretty<00:02:01.210> safe<00:02:01.540> on<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:01.810> benzene<00:02:02.350> has<00:02:02.770> been

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
pretty safe on this benzene has been

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.320 
pretty safe on this benzene has been
able<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.130> make<00:02:03.280> up<00:02:03.400> an<00:02:03.550> enormous<00:02:03.970> amount<00:02:04.210> of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
able to make up an enormous amount of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.550 
able to make up an enormous amount of
straight-line<00:02:04.750> speed<00:02:04.930> let's<00:02:05.290> see<00:02:05.440> how<00:02:05.500> he

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
straight-line speed let's see how he

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.359 
straight-line speed let's see how he
goes<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.990> run<00:02:08.229> out<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> Caltex<00:02:09.070> chase

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
goes good run out of the Caltex chase

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.080 
goes good run out of the Caltex chase
the<00:02:10.240> run<00:02:10.479> down<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.899> Murray's<00:02:11.370> 209<00:02:12.370> 8<00:02:12.640> 9<00:02:12.880> and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the run down to Murray's 209 8 9 and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
the run down to Murray's 209 8 9 and
escapes<00:02:13.420> time<00:02:13.750> wonders<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.980> 210<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:15.820> four

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
escapes time wonders of 210 for four

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.120 
escapes time wonders of 210 for four
we'll<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:16.990> lens<00:02:17.260> leaking<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.740> split<00:02:18.100> that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
we'll see if lens leaking can split that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
we'll see if lens leaking can split that
I<00:02:18.460> don't<00:02:18.730> think<00:02:18.940> he's<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.210> beat<00:02:19.390> escapes

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
I don't think he's going to beat escapes

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.230 
I don't think he's going to beat escapes
time<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.350> ran<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.860> line<00:02:21.040> across<00:02:21.850> cuts

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
time the ran to the line across cuts

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.950 
time the ran to the line across cuts
let's<00:02:22.510> see

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
let's see

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.869 
let's see
at<00:02:23.230> 2:10<00:02:24.010> 8/8

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.699 

what<00:02:31.879> I'm<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.299> ten<00:02:32.810> eight<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.319> third

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
what I'm going to ten eight that's third

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.800 
what I'm going to ten eight that's third
quickest<00:02:34.189> if<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.609> a<00:02:34.879> second<00:02:35.359> slower<00:02:35.569> than

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
quickest if it's a second slower than

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.470 
quickest if it's a second slower than
scaping<00:02:36.290> yeah<00:02:37.069> max<00:02:37.400> done<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.640> sensational<00:02:37.879> time
