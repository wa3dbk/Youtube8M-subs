00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
it really was the worst game I've ever

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.930 
it really was the worst game I've ever
played<00:05:01.080> but<00:05:01.920> overall<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.370> team<00:05:02.700> is

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
played but overall this team is

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.030 
played but overall this team is
absolutely<00:05:03.750> great<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.230> defense<00:05:04.500> midfield<00:05:04.920> is

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
absolutely great in defense midfield is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.490 
absolutely great in defense midfield is
very<00:05:05.220> strong<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:06.090> strike<00:05:06.360> attack<00:05:06.540> is<00:05:06.930> i'd

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
very strong and the strike attack is i'd

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.450 
very strong and the strike attack is i'd
say<00:05:08.780> at<00:05:09.780> least<00:05:09.840> adequate<00:05:10.260> there<00:05:10.950> sometimes<00:05:11.340> it

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
say at least adequate there sometimes it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.560 
say at least adequate there sometimes it
can<00:05:11.550> be<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.670> little<00:05:11.790> bit<00:05:11.940> touch-and-go<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
can be a little bit touch-and-go but the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.090 
can be a little bit touch-and-go but the
left<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.930> right<00:05:12.960> forward<00:05:13.260> outstanding<00:05:13.920> man<00:05:14.070> a
