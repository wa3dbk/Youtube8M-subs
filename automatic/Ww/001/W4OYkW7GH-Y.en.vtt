00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.360
 ah 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.450
 Y 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.190
 How are you welcoming? 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.960
 to a videoblog over his tony friend 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.970
 santitos as we have already done to 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.160
 throughout these tutorials continue 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.410
 teaching nursing techniques to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.560
 that you can do your tasks share 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.059
 with your friends get out better at school 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.910
 do the techniques in your hospital or 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.320
 clinic and also because you can not 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.840
 share here in the bottom 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.879
 tricks that you know or topics that you 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 like to change today will be like 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.620
 make collars for your hospital 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.650
 we know that many times the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.780
 patients to the emergency department and not 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.449
 we have a collar to protect 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.129
 your cervical area many times in the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.769
 hospital does not even count on them 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 we as nurses should know 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.490
 make them and here are the steps 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.219
 The material that we will occupy is very 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.570
 simple let's occupy two bands of 10 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:19.320
 centimeters a little bit of adhesive cloth 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 tubular mesh your ballpoint pen and a cardboard 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 something that is not very thick that any 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.679
 cardboard box that you must have 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.770
 measure approximately 50 or 60 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.929
 centimeters the ideal size will be the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 Your patient's neck plus 10 centimeters 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.630
 extras once you have all the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 material we'll start with step 1 we'll 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.240
 to take the cardboard and exactly to the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.479
 half let's make a mark with back 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.140
 a semicircle a half circle so 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 say it 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 in this way 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.230
 my pen but it remained marked and is what 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 what does it matter 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.940
 this is going to work because here it's going to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 support the patient's chin the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.790
 next step is that approximately 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.070
 almost at the end of your cardboard you go to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.280
 immediate patient and you are going to make a 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.260
 very similar line so that there recharge 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.410
 on the shoulders the collar is not 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.410
 completely straight on both sides 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.239
 the color 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.939
 up to 1 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.350
 let's cut 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.050
 well already trimmed is going to be like this the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.710
 The objective is precisely to free the area 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.190
 of the chin and what 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.740
 to molds on the shoulders remember that 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.600
 The cervical spine is a place when 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.430
 we suspect an injury 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.040
 the immediate indication is the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 immobilization once we have 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.920
 this is the armor the framework of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.890
 our collar we must proceed to 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.410
 have added one consistency the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.819
 let's cover it with the two is ideal 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.359
 is to give it first two turns along 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.359
 a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.920
 cover everything 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.800
 and 2 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.370
 Now we will start to do 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.370
 on the opposite side is to say 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.370
 horizontally 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.730
 once lined the result is this 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.910
 see how good it looks we're going to try it 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.610
 again we feel comfortable 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.440
 have a space remember that he said 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.070
 that you have to leave 10 centimeters more 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.680
 this is to be able to join the one with the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.860
 another and be able to use it well in our 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 patient the third step the last step 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.790
 is going to be put this tubular mesh here 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.390
 for that we are going to need the help of 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.950
 ready ale this tubular mesh will prevent 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.200
 the bandage is moving through the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.680
 patient's movement and this will last us 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.090
 plus the collar, well remember that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.370
 I told them that the size of the cardboard 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.040
 It should be 10 centimeters more than 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.530
 Approximate neck of the patient this is 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.560
 so that when we place it 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.090
 do this thrust there is where 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.960
 let's occupy our adhesive fabric 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.020
 let's paste the end of our 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.730
 collar so that it is totally 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.129
 secured and then we have a 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.349
 Patient with cervical spine 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.119
 well my beloved white shakes 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.949
 up to here the tutorial of today 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.080
 it was a very small very short tutorial 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.119
 put down here in comments what 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.729
 They would like us to discuss what 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.949
 techniques they would like us to see 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.409
 share what you like and well 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.179
 that's all on my part we see each other until 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.179
 the following country tutorial
