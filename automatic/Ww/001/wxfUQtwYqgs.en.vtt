00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.469 
okay because they're going to work your
right<00:01:55.200> brain<00:01:55.439> mitchell<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.219> sick<00:01:56.579> again<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
right brain mitchell is sick again and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
right brain mitchell is sick again and
he<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.840> started<00:01:58.409> motor<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.040> sensory

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
he also started motor and sensory

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520 
he also started motor and sensory
therapy<00:02:00.000> after<00:02:00.329> cognitive<00:02:00.869> tests<00:02:01.140> revealed

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
therapy after cognitive tests revealed

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
therapy after cognitive tests revealed
that<00:02:01.619> his<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:02.130> brain<00:02:02.430> skills<00:02:02.790> were<00:02:03.119> behind

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that his right brain skills were behind

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
that his right brain skills were behind
for<00:02:03.930> his<00:02:04.020> age<00:02:04.259> making<00:02:05.070> him<00:02:05.189> appear<00:02:05.280> immature

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for his age making him appear immature

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.719 
for his age making him appear immature
so<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> left<00:02:07.799> brain<00:02:08.009> skills

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so we look at the left brain skills

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
so we look at the left brain skills
versus<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.539> brain<00:02:09.720> skills<00:02:09.989> let's<00:02:10.470> say

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
versus the right brain skills let's say

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.750 
versus the right brain skills let's say
when<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:12.629> put<00:02:12.810> him<00:02:12.930> through<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> 12-week

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
