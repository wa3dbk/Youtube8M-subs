00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
of it there won't be no mid-engine

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
of it there won't be no mid-engine
layout<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> guys<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.689> hoping<00:00:21.960> for

layout so if you guys were hoping for

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
layout so if you guys were hoping for
mid-engine<00:00:22.710> layout<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.369> elsewhere<00:00:23.760> for

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910

today just the rearward the rearview
visibility<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.720> just<00:01:21.720> negate<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.710> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
visibility in just negate that that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
visibility in just negate that that's
why<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.430> taken<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> rearview

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
why I was taken out because the rearview

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
into the decklid second it looks as

into the decklid second it looks as
though<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> rest<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> rumors

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

the<00:01:37.890> mid-engine<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.610> said<00:01:38.820> earlier

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
the mid-engine which I said earlier

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.240 
the mid-engine which I said earlier
seems<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.590> I'll<00:01:40.740> stick<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
seems that I'll stick with the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
seems that I'll stick with the
front-engine<00:01:41.640> design<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:44.479> transmission<00:01:45.479> now

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
front-engine design the transmission now

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
front-engine design the transmission now
for<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.799> looks<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.430> they're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
for them it looks like they're going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
for them it looks like they're going to
go<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> 7-speed<00:01:48.630> manual<00:01:48.659> transmission

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
go with a 7-speed manual transmission

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
go with a 7-speed manual transmission
just<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> Porsche<00:01:50.220> 911<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.540> also

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
just like the Porsche 911 and it also

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
just like the Porsche 911 and it also
they<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> possibility<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> dct

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they could be a possibility of a dct

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.109 
they could be a possibility of a dct
7-speed<00:01:54.170> DCT<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> money

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
7-speed DCT which if I have the money

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
7-speed DCT which if I have the money
and<00:01:57.350> if<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> choose<00:01:58.979> between<00:01:59.159> a

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
go with the cct probably get the best
lap<00:02:04.320> times<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.040> guys<00:02:05.159> hit<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> track<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
lap times if you guys hit the track a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
lap times if you guys hit the track a
lot<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.600> probably<00:02:07.079> pretty<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
lot would be probably pretty good and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.880 
lot would be probably pretty good and
also<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.580> looks<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> wheelbase<00:02:09.890> has

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
also it looks like the wheelbase has

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.050 
also it looks like the wheelbase has
been<00:02:11.190> increased<00:02:11.610> by<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.849> little<00:02:12.150> bit

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
been increased by a little bit

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.390 
been increased by a little bit
it's<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.440> longer<00:02:14.770> than<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.190> current

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it's a little longer than the current

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.040 
it's a little longer than the current
one<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:16.030> it'll<00:02:16.239> probably<00:02:16.270> offer<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> little

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
one so it'll probably offer a little

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.380 
one so it'll probably offer a little
more<00:02:17.200> trunk<00:02:17.560> room<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:17.920> interior<00:02:18.670> room<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.150> know

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
more trunk room in interior room I know

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.449 
more trunk room in interior room I know
for<00:02:19.510> bigger<00:02:19.900> people<00:02:20.170> sometimes<00:02:20.950> they<00:02:21.190> turned

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
for bigger people sometimes they turned

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.760 
for bigger people sometimes they turned
off<00:02:21.640> by<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.150> Porsche<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.380> hard<00:02:23.590> to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
off by the Porsche because it's hard to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.390 
off by the Porsche because it's hard to
get<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.160> because<00:02:24.760> they<00:02:25.060> are<00:02:25.209> kind<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> small

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
get in because they are kind of small

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.370 
get in because they are kind of small
Corvettes<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.489> little<00:02:27.670> bigger<00:02:27.849> but<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.209> think

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
Corvettes a little bigger but just think

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.350 
Corvettes a little bigger but just think
it'll<00:02:29.380> be<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.530> bigger<00:02:29.800> area<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.239> be

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it'll be a bigger area to get in and be

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.660 
it'll be a bigger area to get in and be
pretty<00:02:31.630> easy<00:02:31.860> comfortable<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.340> ride

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
pretty easy comfortable to the ride

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.600 
pretty easy comfortable to the ride
quality<00:02:34.110> probably<00:02:35.110> be<00:02:35.230> even<00:02:35.769> better<00:02:36.099> than<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
quality probably be even better than the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.860 
quality probably be even better than the
current<00:02:36.940> c6<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> weight<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.840> weight

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
current c6 now for the weight the weight

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
current c6 now for the weight the weight
of<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.260> car<00:02:41.530> will<00:02:41.800> probably<00:02:42.569> be<00:02:43.569> around

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
of this car will probably be around

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.410 
of this car will probably be around
3,000<00:02:44.650> pounds<00:02:45.040> maybe<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.580> higher<00:02:45.819> up<00:02:46.090> models

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
3,000 pounds maybe the higher up models

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.990 
3,000 pounds maybe the higher up models
like<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.690> rail<00:02:47.019> zo6<00:02:47.440> maybe<00:02:48.010> zr1<00:02:48.580> variance

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
like this rail zo6 maybe zr1 variance

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.150 
like this rail zo6 maybe zr1 variance
will<00:02:49.150> be<00:02:49.239> below<00:02:49.540> 3000<00:02:50.170> which<00:02:50.260> we'd<00:02:50.530> awesome

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
will be below 3000 which we'd awesome

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.610 
will be below 3000 which we'd awesome
with<00:02:51.340> how<00:02:51.730> much<00:02:51.880> power<00:02:52.150> they're<00:02:52.420> packing<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
with how much power they're packing this

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.410 
with how much power they're packing this
current<00:02:54.069> mom<00:02:54.220> will<00:02:54.430> probably<00:02:54.610> pack<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.330> in

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
current mom will probably pack it in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.670 
current mom will probably pack it in
about<00:02:56.069> 470<00:02:57.069> 485<00:02:58.030> horse<00:02:58.330> around<00:02:58.690> there<00:02:58.959> that's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
about 470 485 horse around there that's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.339 
about 470 485 horse around there that's
probably<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.130> estimation<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:03.690> finally<00:03:04.690> it

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
probably my estimation and finally it

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.650 
probably my estimation and finally it
looks<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.670> suspension<00:03:07.299> will<00:03:07.390> be<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
looks like the suspension will be the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.020 
looks like the suspension will be the
same<00:03:07.930> they're<00:03:08.410> not<00:03:08.530> changing<00:03:08.950> too<00:03:09.069> much<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
same they're not changing too much the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
same they're not changing too much the
only<00:03:10.120> thing<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.480> think<00:03:10.569> they'll<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:10.959> changing

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
only thing I think they'll be changing

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.949 
only thing I think they'll be changing
is<00:03:11.709> probably<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.430> steering<00:03:12.910> feel<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:13.720> I

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
is probably the steering feel because I

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.680 
is probably the steering feel because I
know<00:03:14.019> novice<00:03:14.920> drivers<00:03:15.370> they<00:03:16.120> can't<00:03:16.420> really

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
know novice drivers they can't really

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.140 
know novice drivers they can't really
take<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.170> Corvette<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.920> its<00:03:18.100> limits<00:03:18.549> or<00:03:18.730> get

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
take the Corvette to its limits or get

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
take the Corvette to its limits or get
up<00:03:19.299> there<00:03:19.570> because<00:03:19.959> it's<00:03:20.230> too<00:03:20.440> hard<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.739> drive

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
up there because it's too hard to drive

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.590 
up there because it's too hard to drive
a<00:03:21.040> racecar<00:03:21.370> driver<00:03:21.609> could<00:03:22.090> because<00:03:22.359> they're

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
a racecar driver could because they're

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.990 
a racecar driver could because they're
professionals<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.980> that's<00:03:24.549> probably<00:03:24.850> where

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
professionals but that's probably where

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.789 
professionals but that's probably where
a<00:03:25.030> lot<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.269> engineering<00:03:25.540> you'll<00:03:26.109> see<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.470> going

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
a lot of engineering you'll see is going

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.470 
a lot of engineering you'll see is going
into<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> steering<00:03:27.820> feel<00:03:28.690> how<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.260> feels<00:03:29.319> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
into the steering feel how it feels and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930 
into the steering feel how it feels and
I'd<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.930> say<00:03:32.170> thanks<00:03:32.829> for<00:03:32.890> watching<00:03:33.489> hope

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
I'd like to say thanks for watching hope
