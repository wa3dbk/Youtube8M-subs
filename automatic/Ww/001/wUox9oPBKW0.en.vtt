00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello girls a very special greeting the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.460
 video is super cortico but super 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 Effective as removing puffs after 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.880
 that we have not slept very well 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 or we are very tired this we can 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
 do at any time of the day and then 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.650
 we just have to rinse the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.330
 face is based on green tea laces 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 obviously it is the tea you take it and the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.910
 little leaves is what we are going to use and what 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.710
 We will do as follows 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 well, we only need leaves of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.759
 green tea obviously we make green tea 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.950
 we do not take it and when the leaves are 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.980
 cool we're going to take a little house like this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.570
 or cotton or just the leaves the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 we are going to open and we are going to form 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 packages to put the eyes 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.390
 We can put the amount we want and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.970
 then simply because we closed it and it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 we will apply a little water so that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.500
 we stayed a little more on the skin and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.890
 we can have a little more as of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.920
 the tea urn in the eyes the green tea 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 it is very very beneficial for many 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.540
 things 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.450
 in studies they have done they say that it is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.630
 well as proven the effects of tea 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.850
 green against mouth cancer is good 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.360
 for vision is good against 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 insomnia improves circulation is good 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.420
 to prevent prostate cancer to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.729
 lung cancer regulate the weight in order 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.259
 a lot of things that later on if 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.690
 want I can make you a video about 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.390
 that and the only thing we're going to do is 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.539
 place the green tea bag of this 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.690
 shape in the eye and we lie down or the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.960
 We hold by hand or as we want 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.429
 for a minimum of five minutes maximum 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.320
 as long as you want and then 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.000
 obviously we only do the face 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.170
 so that we do not stay in sheets in the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.479
 face and look like madremonte 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.220
 it's something very simple that they will see the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.680
 difference so big that it does is like 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.930
 when one is placed under the little 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.700
 cucumber is very large full of 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.130
 antioxidants so it's super good 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.820
 for the eyes and this was like a super 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.470
