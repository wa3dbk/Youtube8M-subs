00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
hi I'm Tory from a media and this is our

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.520 
hi I'm Tory from a media and this is our
latest<00:00:32.449> application<00:00:33.449> building<00:00:34.079> HD<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> what

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
latest application building HD so what

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.890 
latest application building HD so what
you're<00:00:37.800> seeing<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.610> called<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.150> I<00:00:39.300> agree

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
you're seeing here is called the I agree

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.729 
you're seeing here is called the I agree
concept<00:00:40.559> basically<00:00:41.339> we<00:00:42.269> have<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> scale<00:00:42.809> which

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
concept basically we have a scale which

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.939 
concept basically we have a scale which
will<00:00:43.949> never<00:00:44.220> let<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.580> play<00:00:44.790> bad<00:00:45.059> notes<00:00:45.949> what

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
will never let you play bad notes what

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.220 
will never let you play bad notes what
differs<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> agreed<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.449> similar<00:00:48.900> scale

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
differs I agreed from similar scale

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
differs I agreed from similar scale
based<00:00:49.559> concepts<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.420> scale<00:00:51.720> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
based concepts is that the scale is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
based concepts is that the scale is
split<00:00:52.409> up<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.829> parts<00:00:53.339> odd<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.539> even<00:00:55.699> this<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
split up into parts odd and even this is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:07.300 
split up into parts odd and even this is
the<00:00:56.910> odd<00:00:57.149> part<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> even<00:01:05.630> and

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
the odd part and this is the even and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.200 
the odd part and this is the even and
this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> play<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.330> full<00:01:09.630> scale<00:01:09.960> up

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
this is how you play the full scale up

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.190 
this is how you play the full scale up
and<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:16.610> by<00:01:17.610> combining<00:01:18.119> left<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.899> right

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and down by combining left and right

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.169 
and down by combining left and right
hands<00:01:19.679> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.640> impressive

the<00:02:07.739> combined<00:02:08.190> pitch<00:02:08.759> vibrate<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.629> joystick

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the combined pitch vibrate or joystick

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.000 
the combined pitch vibrate or joystick
it<00:02:10.950> bands<00:02:11.580> two<00:02:11.819> semitones<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:13.020> down<00:02:13.440> and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it bands two semitones up or down and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.030 
it bands two semitones up or down and
adds<00:02:14.670> some<00:02:15.120> vibrates<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:16.650> if

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
adds some vibrates of this out if

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
adds some vibrates of this out if
dragged<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> sides

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.320 

these<00:02:26.440> nailed<00:02:26.800> shift<00:02:27.130> buttons<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:27.910> quite

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
these nailed shift buttons are quite

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.290 
these nailed shift buttons are quite
important<00:02:29.370> imagine<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:30.760> holding<00:02:31.150> a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
important imagine that you are holding a

important imagine that you are holding a
melt<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.810> want<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> go<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:33.010> note<00:02:33.280> up<00:02:33.640> or<00:02:33.910> down

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
melt and want to go one note up or down

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.080 
melt and want to go one note up or down
the<00:02:34.240> scale<00:02:35.069> basically<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.730> tap<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the scale basically you can tap the

shift up or down button while holding a
note<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.660> achieve<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.320> same<00:02:41.470> effect<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.270> can

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
note to achieve the same effect you can

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.660 
note to achieve the same effect you can
also<00:02:43.540> use<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.290> create<00:02:44.530> easy<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.400> cool

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
also use this to create easy and cool

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.250 
also use this to create easy and cool

sounding trills the attack joysticks are

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
sounding trills the attack joysticks are
used<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.709> modify<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.160> time<00:02:51.610> or<00:02:51.880> the
