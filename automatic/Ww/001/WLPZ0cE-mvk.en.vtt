it's a great question and to eliminate

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
it's a great question and to eliminate
any<00:00:28.650> moisture<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.220> crawlspace<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
any moisture from your crawlspace the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
any moisture from your crawlspace the
first<00:00:30.300> thing<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> find

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
first thing you do is you have to find

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
first thing you do is you have to find
the<00:00:32.219> source<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> moisture<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the source of the moisture so that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
the source of the moisture so that
involves<00:00:34.050> having<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.380> inspection<00:00:34.710> done<00:00:34.980> or

involves having an inspection done or
some<00:00:35.280> type<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> evaluation<00:00:35.760> whether<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.600> by

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
some type of evaluation whether it's by

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.709 
some type of evaluation whether it's by
professional<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> yourself<00:00:38.719> now

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
professional or you do it yourself now

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
professional or you do it yourself now
if<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.230> crawlspace<00:00:40.500> looks<00:00:41.040> anything<00:00:41.460> like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
if your crawlspace looks anything like

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
if your crawlspace looks anything like
this<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.840> crawl<00:00:42.989> spaces<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.530> see

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this like a lot of crawl spaces we see

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
this like a lot of crawl spaces we see
it's<00:00:44.610> probably<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> place<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's probably not a place you want to

over a couple of things to look for to
find<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> source<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> moisture

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
find out what the source of the moisture

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
find out what the source of the moisture
in<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:04.830> crawlspace<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.720> first<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> all

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
in your crawlspace is first of all

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.480 
in your crawlspace is first of all
realize<00:01:07.110> there's<00:01:07.530> three<00:01:07.830> sources<00:01:08.130> where

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
realize there's three sources where

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.800 
realize there's three sources where
moisture<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:09.000> come<00:01:09.180> come<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:09.720> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
moisture can come come into your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
moisture can come come into your
crawlspace<00:01:10.049> from<00:01:10.580> there<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
crawlspace from there first one is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.109 
crawlspace from there first one is
moisture<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.780> outside<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.650> crawlspace

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
moisture from outside of your crawlspace

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
moisture from outside of your crawlspace
for<00:01:15.119> example<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> rains<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> snow

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for example when it rains we have a snow

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
for example when it rains we have a snow
that<00:01:17.009> melts<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.970> ground<00:01:18.270> becomes<00:01:18.540> saturated

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that melts the ground becomes saturated

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
that melts the ground becomes saturated
with<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:20.250> table<00:01:20.580> Rises<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
with water the water table Rises and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
with water the water table Rises and
water<00:01:22.200> comes<00:01:22.409> into<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:22.710> crawlspace<00:01:22.950> from

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
water comes into your crawlspace from

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
water comes into your crawlspace from
that<00:01:23.490> source<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> great<00:01:24.630> picture<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> show

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that source it's a great picture to show

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.020 
that source it's a great picture to show
you<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> great<00:01:25.710> example<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> crawlspace

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you a great example where the crawlspace

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
you a great example where the crawlspace
is<00:01:27.450> flooded<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.860> moisture

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is flooded and this is from moisture

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
is flooded and this is from moisture
from<00:01:29.280> groundwater<00:01:30.320> another<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> look

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
from groundwater another thing to look

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
from groundwater another thing to look
for<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.250> crawlspace<00:01:32.520> door<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.299> the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.649 
start to rot and fall down and hang it's
because<00:03:29.699> it's<00:03:29.849> getting<00:03:30.030> wet<00:03:30.269> from<00:03:30.479> moisture

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659

the<00:03:38.669> first<00:03:38.909> thing<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.449> find<00:03:39.870> out<00:03:39.989> what<00:03:40.199> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
the first thing is to find out what the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.839 
the first thing is to find out what the
source<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.919> moisture<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.639> in<00:03:41.759> your

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
source of the moisture is in your

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.059 
source of the moisture is in your
crawlspace<00:03:42.139> once<00:03:43.139> you<00:03:43.259> know<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.530> source<00:03:43.799> then

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
crawlspace once you know the source then

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.309 
crawlspace once you know the source then
you<00:03:44.099> can<00:03:44.280> stop<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.819> source<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.689> you<00:03:45.750> do<00:03:46.169> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
you can stop the source and you do the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.409 
you can stop the source and you do the
same<00:03:46.560> way<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.859> we<00:03:46.949> inspect<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.459> first<00:03:48.239> thing

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
same way that we inspect it first thing

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.699 
same way that we inspect it first thing
we<00:03:48.509> do<00:03:48.629> is<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:48.810> stop<00:03:49.049> any<00:03:49.319> type<00:03:49.439> of<00:03:49.530> outside

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
we do is we stop any type of outside

secondly we stop any type of inside

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.959 
secondly we stop any type of inside
moisture<00:03:54.959> leaks<00:03:55.139> from<00:03:55.319> happening<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.969> third

moisture leaks from happening and third

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.270 
moisture leaks from happening and third
we<00:03:57.689> control<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.259> humidity<00:03:58.500> levels<00:03:58.979> in<00:03:59.159> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
we control the humidity levels in the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.729 
we control the humidity levels in the
air<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.579> your<00:03:59.699> crawlspace<00:04:00.139> we<00:04:01.139> do<00:04:01.319> all<00:04:01.469> three

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
air in your crawlspace we do all three

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.259 
air in your crawlspace we do all three
of<00:04:01.769> these<00:04:01.979> we've<00:04:02.280> created<00:04:02.609> a<00:04:02.759> conditioned

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
of these we've created a conditioned

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.259 
of these we've created a conditioned
crawl<00:04:03.449> space<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.650> will<00:04:04.739> be<00:04:04.799> dry<00:04:05.189> healthy<00:04:06.030> and

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
crawl space that will be dry healthy and

pick up added storage space on your

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.559 
pick up added storage space on your
crawlspace<00:04:11.180> because<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.239> have<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:12.389> condition

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
crawlspace because you have a condition

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.050 
crawlspace because you have a condition
that<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.959> can<00:04:13.019> store<00:04:13.259> your<00:04:13.439> belongings<00:04:13.919> in<00:04:14.489> so
