into<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.470> hole<00:03:17.740> yes<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.340> said<00:03:18.520> across<00:03:18.850> not

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
into this hole yes I said across not

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.470 
into this hole yes I said across not
across<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> tee<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.280> don't<00:03:21.550> know<00:03:21.700> why<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> say

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.710 
and try to keep your laces from getting
twisted<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.620> when<00:03:51.070> you're<00:03:51.250> doing<00:03:51.820> these<00:03:52.450> lace

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
twisted up when you're doing these lace

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.170 
twisted up when you're doing these lace
patterns<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.380> just<00:03:53.560> looks<00:03:54.430> really<00:03:54.610> good<00:03:54.970> if

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
patterns it just looks really good if

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.720 
patterns it just looks really good if
they're<00:03:55.420> not<00:03:55.540> all<00:03:55.720> twisted<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.460> can<00:03:57.580> see

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
they're not all twisted so you can see

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.520 
they're not all twisted so you can see
I've<00:03:57.820> got<00:03:57.970> them<00:03:58.150> both<00:03:58.300> pulled<00:03:58.810> out<00:03:58.960> now<00:03:59.200> and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
I've got them both pulled out now and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.170 
I've got them both pulled out now and
I'm<00:03:59.800> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.100> take<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.430> into<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.910> holes

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
I'm going to take it into the holes

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.230 
I'm going to take it into the holes
right<00:04:01.660> above<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:05.940> same<00:04:06.940> thing<00:04:07.120> on

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
right above just like that same thing on

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:15.070 
right above just like that same thing on
this<00:04:07.420> side<00:04:09.840> straight<00:04:10.840> into

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.420 

so<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.140> should<00:04:16.320> look<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.890> at<00:04:17.340> that

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so it should look like this at that

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.710 
so it should look like this at that
point<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:19.130> now<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.670> can<00:04:21.000> there's<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.540> couple

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
point and now you can there's a couple

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.410 
point and now you can there's a couple
different<00:04:21.810> options<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.530> since<00:04:22.890> I'm<00:04:23.100> using

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
different options here since I'm using

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.720 
different options here since I'm using
the<00:04:24.420> ink<00:04:24.630> tip<00:04:24.960> laces<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.160> kind<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.430> want<00:04:26.640> to

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
the ink tip laces and I kind of want to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060 
the ink tip laces and I kind of want to
see<00:04:27.270> them<00:04:27.480> just<00:04:27.990> well<00:04:28.410> I'm<00:04:28.590> not<00:04:28.740> wearing<00:04:28.980> these

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
see them just well I'm not wearing these

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.340 
see them just well I'm not wearing these
shoes<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.640> was<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.300> can<00:04:30.420> just<00:04:30.570> tie<00:04:30.810> your

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
shoes but if I was you can just tie your

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.530 
shoes but if I was you can just tie your
bow<00:04:31.560> or<00:04:31.740> not<00:04:31.890> now<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> purple

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
bow or not now and you have the purple

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.090 
bow or not now and you have the purple
tips<00:04:33.870> which<00:04:34.200> kind<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.650> looks<00:04:34.800> good<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.040> two

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
tips which kind of looks good in two

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.000 
tips which kind of looks good in two
pops<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:35.580> if<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.910> don't<00:04:36.090> like<00:04:36.560> having<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.830> bow

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
pops but if you don't like having a bow

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.230 
pops but if you don't like having a bow
on<00:04:38.250> top<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.550> your<00:04:38.640> vans<00:04:38.820> which<00:04:39.060> I'd<00:04:39.210> say

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
on top of your vans which I'd say

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.620 
on top of your vans which I'd say
majority<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.020> people<00:04:40.800> don't<00:04:41.420> just<00:04:42.420> take

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
majority of the people don't just take

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.320 
majority of the people don't just take
it<00:04:42.690> into<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.380> hole<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.860> side<00:04:44.300> take<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it into the hole on this side take it

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.550 
it into the hole on this side take it
into<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> hole<00:04:46.230> on<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:47.100> opposite<00:04:47.580> side<00:04:48.560> and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
into the hole on the opposite side and

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.470

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
this is what I did on this shoe over

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.220 
this is what I did on this shoe over

them<00:04:55.320> nice<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.530> straight<00:04:56.100> now<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:56.700> can<00:04:56.820> tie

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
going to use the lace anchors you're

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.580 
going to use the lace anchors you're
going<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.450> install<00:05:00.750> them<00:05:00.900> directly<00:05:01.380> behind

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
all this extra lacing but obviously it'd

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.020 
all this extra lacing but obviously it'd
be<00:05:06.810> kind<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:06.990> pointless<00:05:07.140> if<00:05:07.470> you're<00:05:07.590> doing<00:05:07.860> the
