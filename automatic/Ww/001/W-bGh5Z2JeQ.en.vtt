there<00:00:50.830> was<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:50.980> lot<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.250> really<00:00:51.580> awkward<00:00:52.150> moment

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
there was a lot of really awkward moment

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.630 
there was a lot of really awkward moment
so<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.990> was<00:00:53.020> just<00:00:53.110> like<00:00:53.410> funny<00:00:54.070> when<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.490> should

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
so it was just like funny when it should

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.630 
so it was just like funny when it should
have<00:00:54.670> been<00:00:54.790> sad<00:00:55.150> but<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.960> overall<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:57.490> was

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640

have been sad but I overall it was
amazing<00:00:58.060> I<00:00:58.660> think<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.410> was<00:00:59.890> definitely<00:01:00.130> the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
amazing I think this was definitely the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.410 
amazing I think this was definitely the
film<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.780> they<00:01:02.080> stuck<00:01:03.040> closest<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.210> book
