that's<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.040> intro<00:02:22.400> alright<00:02:23.239> now<00:02:23.510> we'll<00:02:23.930> do

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
that's the intro alright now we'll do

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.750 
that's the intro alright now we'll do
the<00:02:25.150> verse<00:02:26.620> I'll<00:02:27.620> play<00:02:28.099> it<00:02:28.219> through<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.670> then

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the verse I'll play it through and then

00:02:28.760 --> 00:03:09.559 
the verse I'll play it through and then
I'll<00:02:28.849> show<00:02:28.969> you<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.239> doing

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.670 

all<00:03:10.569> right<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.140> whole<00:03:11.319> verse<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.909> quartz

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
all right so that whole verse is quartz

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.679 
all right so that whole verse is quartz
there's<00:03:14.680> no<00:03:14.920> real<00:03:15.189> leaf<00:03:15.489> for<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.909> so<00:03:16.329> basically

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
there's no real leaf for it so basically

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.089 
there's no real leaf for it so basically
it's<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.200> G<00:03:19.019> B<00:03:20.019> minor

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
it's just G B minor

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:37.690 
it's just G B minor
see<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:28.420> B<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:31.900> C<00:03:32.900> again<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.920> now<00:03:37.519> we'll

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
see a B and C again that's it now we'll

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.209 
see a B and C again that's it now we'll
go<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.030> course<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.719> I'll<00:03:39.709> play<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.099> and
