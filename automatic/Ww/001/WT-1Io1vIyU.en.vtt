00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
weird and confusing and it's actually

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.410 
weird and confusing and it's actually
happened<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> few<00:00:35.250> times<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.880> hosts<00:00:36.149> with

you is if you guys have all those

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.800 
you is if you guys have all those
options<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:53.940> stuff<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.450> your<00:02:54.480> house

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
options for stuff you can at your house

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.020 
options for stuff you can at your house
don't<00:02:55.410> click<00:02:55.650> them<00:02:55.800> all<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.100> once<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.790> very

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
don't click them all at once be very

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.420 
don't click them all at once be very
careful<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.750> slow<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.260> choosing<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.220> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
careful and slow with choosing them and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.340 
careful and slow with choosing them and
then<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.360> get<00:03:00.540> them<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.050> you're

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
then if you can get them all then you're

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.770 
then if you can get them all then you're
good<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.820> think<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.120> could<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.630> I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
good but I don't think I could because I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.090 
good but I don't think I could because I
I<00:03:04.019> messed<00:03:04.440> something<00:03:04.530> up

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
I messed something up

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.250 
I messed something up
anyway<00:03:05.820> long<00:03:06.239> story<00:03:06.360> short<00:03:06.660> look<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.110> got

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
anyway long story short look we got

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.940 
anyway long story short look we got
microbes<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.890> wall<00:03:08.040> um<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.320> think<00:03:10.440> one

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
microbes on the wall um so I think one

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
microbes on the wall um so I think one
of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> reasons<00:03:11.459> why<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.670> was<00:03:11.880> kind<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.360> weird

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of the reasons why it was kind of weird

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.020 
of the reasons why it was kind of weird
and<00:03:13.019> glitchy<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.470> house<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:14.030> actually

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and glitchy in the house is actually

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.430 
and glitchy in the house is actually

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
for money instead of using resources and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.870 
for money instead of using resources and
they<00:03:29.100> decorated<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.850> lot<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.840> oh<00:03:31.230> its<00:03:31.590> Rhea

they decorated a lot but basically when

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.180 
they decorated a lot but basically when
