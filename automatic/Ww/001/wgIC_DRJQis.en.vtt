00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.200
 Lewis and welcome to another new lead 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 him tutorial of and and projects 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.970
 check to my site www point and one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.040
 piece of project point nl 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.650
 I apologize for a while no longer 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.390
 it seems like a theory I have uploaded 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.280
 I've been pretty busy but that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 busy periods now with 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.110
 all kinds of test weeks and that is a hassle 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 and now I go for one again every week 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.960
 tutorial 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 upload also am not subscribed question 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 I also press young people button 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 and so you can watch every video i make 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.200
 and it 's free 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 well and today i'm going to talk about one 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 heikki portrait 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.700
 how you should shoot that I have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.790
 written and typed out and in the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.369
 text and the text thereof is in the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.729
 description I'm going to talk about now 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 really editing the portrait 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.000
 so this is step two well first 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.740
 you must import I did 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 and then your library. I'll check you out 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.149
 develop well he creeper ted is one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.860
 reasonably overexposed photo 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.390
 you also see here but the histogram was 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.660
 that's going to pay attention 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 you see such a whole peak on the right 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.440
 well those are the white ones 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.970
 highlights say and 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.740
 means that this photo is already reasonable 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.300
 He is not completely overexposed 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.250
 the side 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.560
 as soon as we turn up the exposure 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 here more and more that more and more 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.289
 goes to the right 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 the white background is actually hair 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.569
 without the business where he looked 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.220
 photography 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.130
 you should actually have as much white as possible 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.800
 find in this photo use this girl 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 he has a kind of shirt on that is 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.740
 actually not useful my heikki 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.330
 photography 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.539
 so there is a cut off a week than sjors 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.390
 until around here that scarves are reasonable 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.610
 soft not completely white 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 so my solution for that is i go him 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.870
 actually doing it in black and white too 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.280
 perhaps nicer 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.569
 well we have scammed up 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.219
 could still be slightly higher 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.049
 now you can see the face of her 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.549
 a bit of bad luck than that 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.670
 appearance 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.670
 click with contas a little more up to 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:33.569
 roughly so still a bit of the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.019
 high is a little more up than 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.639
 we separate a little more downwards 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.219
 and white tents which him high I go 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.219
 lie well this way 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.430
 then a little less 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.629
 zadkine play a little whatever you like 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.120
 can do is go to the qwerty 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.859
 clarity and if you can here 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.659
 especially when you see that very much 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.500
 Soft is often up to him here 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.389
 becomes very hard 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.459
 well i here portrait is generally 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.540
 very soft or what I often used with 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.389
 image with babies and things like that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.939
 I am expressing wholeness 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:16.000
 a little more down it becomes one 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.349
 bit of a dreamy soft soft photo 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.849
 from 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:25.359
 now we go the details of course 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:27.159
 briefly sharp and effects well with one 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.840
 vignette I do actually always so 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.090
 where the vignette fik normally finds that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.459
 much beautiful but by law law is correct 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.909
 in there I'm just your white fini 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.909
 to indicate 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.379
 just about you see it here that white 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.049
 there is no difference here because you see 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.819
 the background is actually just fit 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.129
 now you really put the focus on 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.919
 her face 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.419
 well what else you can do is one 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:58.239
 little brush and then the brightness that 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.340
 then put it down then you go like that 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.239
 for a moment on the house on the right a nice 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.239
 are the skin of 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.849
 you can actually go with all portrait photos 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.370
 do see the pimples also less 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:18.630
 got them on nice even skin times you 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.630
 see what you have missed 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.949
 I was just quick 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.669
 so 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.169
 can still lift it up here and to it 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.710
 below that you see it it is not 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.250
 nice little bit down right 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.389
 still a soft skin of a bit 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.729
 zoom in to see if there is anything else 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.330
 spots see it yes your mustache spot 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.330
 we clone away 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.259
 spot here 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.300
 press the space bar 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.080
 if your client wants to say so 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.840
 you can tick on the space bar 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.470
 and then times in such a mine you have 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.210
 the hand now so that you might want so over 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.879
 to go 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:22.419
 just scroll smaller and smaller 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.419
 space bar 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.539
 so you can just leave the fore 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.539
 see 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.409
