00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.389
 presentation of this new series of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 videos 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.119
 today I am going to introduce you a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.789
 new type of video that will be present 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.100
 on my channel I hope so soon Kim 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.010
 was advised by a reader of leiria 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 the block on which I write my articles 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.269
 that I invite you to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 consult frequently so this new 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.860
 kind of videos these are the ones in some 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 sort of videos debate about 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.670
 different classes of dofus who 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 could also be generalized on 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 other official activities outside 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 classes so these videos debates that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.039
 have value both presentation of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 the presentation class of his 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.090
 evolution since its creation and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 obviously future evolution that she 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 could have come soon redesign or 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.579
 via just a few improvements that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.649
 could do that class 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 will become in perfect quotation marks 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 all this obviously in order to arrive 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.020
 to a perfect balancing news 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.290
 quote quotes which 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 will of course be impossible since the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 classes are far too diverse and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.060
 so unless it's all clones 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.490
 can never be balanced 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 perfectly 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.369
 note, however, that the old 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.619
 players will surely have noticed 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.799
 the current balancing class is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.290
 the best we've had since 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.020
 since creation the game's release the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.390
 bigger at sight have been erased and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.439
 all classes are absolutely 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.119
 not at the same level we agree 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.210
 but all classes have or have had 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.439
 the utility and can annoy the team 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 adversary who was not the case 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.420
 the time and some purpose is really 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.890
 far too much present I think 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 especially for older players 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 as bordering could be 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.860
 invisible see a little delirium or the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 tram could be melee without 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.250
 become visible again for young people 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 players who scream at the scandal over 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.710
 little abuse that's what we've known 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.259
 so balancing hakem is polluted by 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.310
 happily with time so these 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.190
 bass videos are of course 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.050
 subject to answers from you and has 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.370
 also gave your opinion I will give 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.500
 my opinion trying to him more 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.940
 possible goal of course I do not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.770
 will not be since it will remain my point 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.260
 of view but I tightened all the same 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.550
 to have an objective point of view 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.360
 I also specify that I do not 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.580
 will look at the classes that pvp thl 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.290
 so when jvp I'm talking about 3v 3 4 and 4 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.269
 and 5 drawings that are the three modes the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.620
 played even more than the cad 4 v is 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.730
 very exceptional way during the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.880
 goultarminator so the rvr is no longer 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.700
 the whole studio does not take care of it anymore 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.019
 so it's useless to discuss it and he 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.150
 turns out to be otherwise small 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.470
 parenthesis one comes is better in 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.900
 better balanced when one is he is 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.400
 of 3 v 3 see mark currently the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.000
 wine is much more balanced than there is 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.019
 a few years 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.250
 so in the end everyone is happy 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.650
 so I will study the classes under this 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.660
 angle there I will speak very rarely pvm 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.220
 is really a lot more grandpa 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.470
 sorry for those who would like me 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.019
 talk about the average pib level the brooms 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.450
 want I do not have the knowledge on 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.459
 cpdp there so I really could not 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.709
 you talk about it neither staffs nor 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.109
 ways of playing I could not 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.350
 tell you about that so I will stay fixed 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.590
 on pvp thl with classes 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.540
 obviously at the top of their optimization 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.269
 I did not talk to you about pvp with 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.480
 players in deep and at 5pm you doubt 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.549
 well 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.079
 I'm going to talk about classes at the most 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.390
 their abilities at the same level 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.190
 optimization is this class 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.540
 is more viable than another or what 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.470
 what is it that has the advantage that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.030
 does it have the disadvantage 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.000
 what could we possibly do 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.100
 to improve it without giving birth 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.540
 new abuses often that's it with 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.680
 a redesign of a class we have 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.989
 new abuses that appear and that's 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.299
 that the danger is in removing abuses 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.329
 we create it again that's where the whole 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.370
 difficulty to evolve a game that's 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.100
 so these videos obviously its about to 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.200
 debate you can answer I hope that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.319
 you will also give me your opinion in the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.010
 purpose a little to see what the community 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.569
 satan during character redesigns 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.210
 can speak certainly a lot more 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.950
 late, from the beginning of the event, to whom 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.840
 characters who will be in the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.140
 redesign will be carried out within a few 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.620
 month we hope I'll start with the 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.880
 peacock dawa since it's my class it's 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.820
 that I want to start with 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.280
 take it to me so we'll start with the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.200
 panda during episode 1 where I hope 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.000
 that he will come out soon enough and I tell you 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.980
 to very quickly for episode 20 of this 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.980
 new series by everyone
