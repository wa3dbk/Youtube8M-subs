the<00:01:38.179> way<00:01:38.299> we've<00:01:38.569> designed<00:01:38.929> it<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.530> back

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the way we've designed it is in the back

grass if they get all the nutrients from

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.949 
grass if they get all the nutrients from
the<00:01:51.439> grass<00:01:51.619> itself<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.369> vitamin<00:01:52.789> usage<00:01:53.179> they

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
the grass itself the vitamin usage they

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.349 
the grass itself the vitamin usage they
get<00:01:54.140> more<00:01:54.380> protein<00:01:54.679> from<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.099> bugs<00:01:55.369> they're

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.529 
out here by our garden so they help keep
the<00:01:59.479> pests<00:01:59.990> down<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.849> it's<00:02:01.849> just<00:02:02.030> an<00:02:02.359> all

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
the pests down and it's just an all

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.809 
the pests down and it's just an all
around<00:02:02.569> a<00:02:02.959> good<00:02:03.109> thing<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.219> I'll<00:02:04.429> show<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:04.579> as

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
around a good thing so I'll show you as

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.490 
around a good thing so I'll show you as
we<00:02:04.969> move<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.299> tips<00:02:05.539> watch<00:02:05.869> what<00:02:06.049> they<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.229> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
we move the tips watch what they do that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:42.580 
we move the tips watch what they do that
you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.740> instantly<00:02:07.340> eat<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.819> draft<00:02:41.590> okay

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you can instantly eat in the draft okay

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.199 
you can instantly eat in the draft okay
and<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:42.889> this<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.220> before<00:02:43.400> they<00:02:43.700> even<00:02:43.819> get<00:02:44.090> any

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
and so this is before they even get any

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.210 
and so this is before they even get any
feed<00:02:44.510> again<00:02:44.780> they<00:02:45.170> don't<00:02:45.349> have<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.799> pumped

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
feed again they don't have to be pumped

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.879 
feed again they don't have to be pumped
full<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.609> any<00:02:46.970> kind<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.680> steroids<00:02:48.680> or
