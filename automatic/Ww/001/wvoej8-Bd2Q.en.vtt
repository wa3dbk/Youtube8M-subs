00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.399 
it but nothing's going to come up
actually<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.389> that<00:03:38.900> didn't<00:03:39.200> work<00:03:39.379> for

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
actually here it is that didn't work for

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.170 
actually here it is that didn't work for
me<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.799> first<00:03:39.980> time<00:03:40.159> it<00:03:40.430> didn't<00:03:40.760> come<00:03:40.879> up<00:03:40.909> like

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
me the first time it didn't come up like

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.270 
me the first time it didn't come up like
this<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:41.750> if<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.930> does<00:03:42.109> come<00:03:42.349> up<00:03:42.379> for<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:43.040> you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
this so if it does come up for you you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.610 
this so if it does come up for you you
can<00:03:43.790> install<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.359> right<00:03:44.810> from<00:03:44.959> here<00:03:45.019> but<00:03:45.530> I'm

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
can install it right from here but I'm

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.629 
can install it right from here but I'm
going<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.799> show<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.159> other<00:03:46.280> way<00:03:46.459> because

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
going to show you the other way because

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.339 
going to show you the other way because
like<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:46.969> said<00:03:47.150> -<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.299> first<00:03:47.510> time<00:03:47.629> for<00:03:47.840> me<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
like I said - the first time for me it

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.569 
like I said - the first time for me it
didn't<00:03:48.620> come<00:03:48.739> up<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.010> list<00:03:49.219> here<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.519> I

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
didn't come up in the list here and I

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.770 
didn't come up in the list here and I
think<00:03:49.790> some<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.180> might<00:03:50.359> run<00:03:50.450> into<00:03:50.510> that

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
think some of you might run into that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.869 
think some of you might run into that
problem<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.590> again<00:03:52.189> you<00:03:52.280> can<00:03:52.370> install<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:52.730> from

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
problem so again you can install it from

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.339 
problem so again you can install it from
here<00:03:53.060> if<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.209> comes<00:03:53.359> up<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.569> your<00:03:53.629> list<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:54.049> not

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349

that's<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.610> number<00:05:11.850> I'd<00:05:11.940> like<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.180> use

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
that's the number I'd like to use

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.530 
that's the number I'd like to use
so<00:05:14.600> what<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.080> found<00:05:15.380> out<00:05:15.650> is<00:05:15.920> that<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.550> SMS<00:05:17.210> part

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
so what I found out is that the SMS part

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.330 
so what I found out is that the SMS part
of<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:17.870> doesn't<00:05:18.230> work<00:05:18.620> because<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.190> will

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
of this doesn't work because it will

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.710 
of this doesn't work because it will
send<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.790> text<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.330> don't<00:05:20.480> have<00:05:20.570> any

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
place to enter it on the screen here so

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.250 
place to enter it on the screen here so
you're<00:05:22.850> going<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.030> get<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.150> text<00:05:23.600> but<00:05:24.110> you're

going to kind of ignore that and you

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.950 
going to kind of ignore that and you
have<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.640> wait<00:05:25.760> for<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.030> to<00:05:26.090> timeout<00:05:26.570> here<00:05:26.840> and
