 the railway works ottbergen here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.319
 beats the heart of the model bundesbahn 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.040
 as Dreesh old berta once said 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.769
 willi with me it's always about his 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 only 20 5 meter long turntable bÃ¼hler 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.039
 is actually too small for the 2200 62 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.039
 centimeter measuring series 44 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.910
 while turning poland already look 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 Locomotive driver beyond the turntable 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 Elmar says well I have to stop there 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 A closer look at the model 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 takes a fail-safe block and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 light more technology the exact right one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 Positioning taken 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 3 mm are left to model bundesbahnen im

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.820
 a man and his cheery franz lutz 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.269
 should with 44 6 69 a passage 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.489
 later moved to Herzberg take over 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.129

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.229
 line over in the railway depot 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 may only ten kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.690
 be driven 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.270
 straight rolls 44 669 on 1965 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.840

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.259
 track 54 may elmar clear 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.660
