this<00:00:16.340> is<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.520> car<00:00:16.790> that<00:00:16.820> we're<00:00:17.119> going<00:00:17.210> to<00:00:17.270> be

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
this is a car that we're going to be

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.580 
this is a car that we're going to be
running<00:00:17.510> we're<00:00:17.810> going<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.080> building<00:00:18.290> and

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
running we're going to be building and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.900 
running we're going to be building and
running<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.890> Targa<00:00:19.279> Newfoundland<00:00:19.730> in

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910

running a Targa Newfoundland in
September<00:00:20.360> of<00:00:20.450> this<00:00:20.600> year<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.140> what<00:00:21.290> we're

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
September of this year so what we're

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.320 
September of this year so what we're
doing<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:21.800> just<00:00:21.860> you<00:00:22.100> can<00:00:22.250> see<00:00:22.460> here<00:00:22.700> we're

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
doing is just you can see here we're

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.000 
doing is just you can see here we're
stripping<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:23.750> car<00:00:23.990> we're<00:00:24.289> reducing<00:00:24.590> every

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
stripping the car we're reducing every

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.350 
stripping the car we're reducing every
bit<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.160> weight<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.400> we<00:00:25.640> possibly<00:00:26.060> can

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
bit of weight that we possibly can

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.630 
bit of weight that we possibly can
lighter<00:00:26.840> weight<00:00:27.050> panels<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:27.770> hood<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.340> going

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
lighter weight panels so hood is going

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.920 
lighter weight panels so hood is going
to<00:00:28.700> be<00:00:28.789> put<00:00:28.940> on<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.119> car<00:00:29.300> carbon<00:00:29.690> fiber

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
to be put on the car carbon fiber

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.560 
to be put on the car carbon fiber
decklid<00:00:30.590> lighter<00:00:31.039> weight<00:00:31.250> doors<00:00:31.550> licks<00:00:32.330> and

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
decklid lighter weight doors licks and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.420 
decklid lighter weight doors licks and
windows<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:33.559> then<00:00:33.710> as<00:00:33.860> well<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.129> have<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.309> put

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
windows but then as well we have to put

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.740 
windows but then as well we have to put
a<00:00:34.460> lot<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.580> safety<00:00:34.940> equipment<00:00:35.000> into<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.570> car

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
a lot of safety equipment into the car

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.210 
a lot of safety equipment into the car
like<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.140> roll<00:00:36.350> cage<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.830> it's<00:00:36.949> kind<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.100> a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
like the roll cage so it's kind of a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.850 
like the roll cage so it's kind of a
fool<00:00:37.570> chromoly<00:00:38.570> roll<00:00:38.900> cage<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:39.650> you<00:00:39.739> can

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
fool chromoly roll cage which you can

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.170 
fool chromoly roll cage which you can
see<00:00:39.890> we're<00:00:40.160> just<00:00:40.190> starting<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.820> right<00:00:41.030> now

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
see we're just starting to do right now

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.710 
see we're just starting to do right now
like<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.110> seats<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.390> reducing<00:00:44.390> weight<00:00:44.540> where

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
like the seats and reducing weight where

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.750 
like the seats and reducing weight where
we<00:00:44.899> can<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:45.590> that's<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.040> goal<00:00:46.220> more

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
we can because that's the goal more

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.240 
we can because that's the goal more
horsepower<00:00:47.020> better<00:00:48.020> brakes<00:00:48.320> AP<00:00:49.070> racing

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
horsepower better brakes AP racing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.270 
horsepower better brakes AP racing
brakes<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.970> car<00:00:50.000> different<00:00:50.899> suspension

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
brakes on the car different suspension

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.889 
brakes on the car different suspension
we<00:00:52.280> really<00:00:52.550> get<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.700> look<00:00:53.239> at<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.420> whole<00:00:53.600> car

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
we really get a look at the whole car

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.200 
we really get a look at the whole car
and<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:54.710> upgrade<00:00:55.130> it<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:55.760> carefully

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
and just upgrade it but but carefully

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.030 
and just upgrade it but but carefully
because<00:00:56.329> it's<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.719> 6<00:00:56.960> tie<00:00:57.110> rally<00:00:57.140> tarmac<00:00:57.860> rally

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
because it's a 6 tie rally tarmac rally

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.319 
because it's a 6 tie rally tarmac rally
and<00:00:58.750> endurance<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.079> main<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.829> main

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
and endurance is the main the main

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.679 
and endurance is the main the main
that<00:01:01.660> rally<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:03.210> we've<00:01:04.210> built<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.479> lot<00:01:04.600> of

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
that rally so we've built a lot of

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.149 
that rally so we've built a lot of
different<00:01:04.720> parts<00:01:05.229> like<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> exhaust<00:01:05.770> system

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
different parts like the exhaust system

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.980 
different parts like the exhaust system
the<00:01:06.580> aerodynamic<00:01:07.149> parts<00:01:07.509> like<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.780> front

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
the aerodynamic parts like the front

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.380 
the aerodynamic parts like the front
splitter<00:01:08.350> different<00:01:08.830> rockers<00:01:09.250> this<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
splitter different rockers this is the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.670 
splitter different rockers this is the
chrome<00:01:10.600> moly<00:01:10.810> tube<00:01:11.080> which<00:01:11.259> is<00:01:11.380> going<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.590> be

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
chrome moly tube which is going to be

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.490 
chrome moly tube which is going to be
the<00:01:11.799> a-pillar<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.460> then<00:01:13.110> we'll<00:01:14.110> have<00:01:14.229> cross

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the a-pillar and then we'll have cross

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.170 
the a-pillar and then we'll have cross
braces<00:01:14.950> across<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.430> door<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.030> on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
braces across the door and so on

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.399 
braces across the door and so on
lightweight<00:01:16.899> seats<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.810> really<00:01:20.110> make<00:01:20.289> the

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
lightweight seats really really make the

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.630 
lightweight seats really really make the
car<00:01:20.680> much<00:01:21.580> stronger<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.930> terms<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.350> safety<00:01:23.649> but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
car much stronger in terms of safety but

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.490 
car much stronger in terms of safety but
also<00:01:24.670> trying<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> do<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.689> as<00:01:25.780> like<00:01:25.960> as<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.259> can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
also trying to do it as like as we can

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.710 
also trying to do it as like as we can
because<00:01:26.740> way<00:01:27.070> does<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.460> EMA<00:01:28.179> this<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
because way does the EMA this is the

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.779 
because way does the EMA this is the
pile<00:01:29.049> of<00:01:29.229> parts<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.799> we<00:01:29.890> have<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.369> GTR

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
pile of parts that we have for the GTR

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.179 
pile of parts that we have for the GTR
race<00:01:31.030> car<00:01:31.270> when<00:01:32.140> we<00:01:32.259> went<00:01:32.470> through<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> car

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
race car when we went through that car

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.309 
race car when we went through that car
we<00:01:33.819> basically<00:01:34.090> had<00:01:34.569> it<00:01:34.720> sitting<00:01:34.899> right<00:01:35.140> here

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
we basically had it sitting right here

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.350 
we basically had it sitting right here
and<00:01:35.440> stripped<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.860> all<00:01:35.979> apart<00:01:36.360> took

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
and stripped it all apart took

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.749 
and stripped it all apart took
everything<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.020> seats<00:01:38.350> these<00:01:39.159> seats<00:01:39.520> way

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
everything out the seats these seats way

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.520 
everything out the seats these seats way
65<00:01:40.420> pounds<00:01:40.929> each<00:01:41.080> they're<00:01:41.770> really<00:01:42.610> heavy

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
65 pounds each they're really heavy

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.570 
65 pounds each they're really heavy
because<00:01:44.530> they<00:01:44.679> have<00:01:44.770> all<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.009> airbags<00:01:45.369> in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
because they have all the airbags in

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.859 
because they have all the airbags in
them<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.789> everything<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.240> all<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> motors
