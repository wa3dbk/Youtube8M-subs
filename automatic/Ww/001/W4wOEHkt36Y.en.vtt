00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 hi swami azik &amp; the black fly 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.799
 vlog about airplanes and helicopters 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.840
 parachute paragliders in one word about 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.840
 all that flies in the sky flew 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.369
 when i stumbled upon this video i'm honest 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.369
 saying was shocked 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 This toy is really a toy. 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.500
 Of course , the airport is not at all 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.719
 present 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.820
 but if you know how much was invested in 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.680
 his strength and money how much time was 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.140
 spent that in this all build a 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.489
 because in this earned a toy 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:48.129
 after that what happened to be called 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:49.750
 language does not turn imagine 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.040
 just what I build a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.689
 it took two years to design this miracle 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.080
 almost another five years after that 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.080
 built 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.710
 see everything as actually my 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.090
 report 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.850
 plane runway 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 the role of hp without St. Petersburg tower 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.500
 tanker cars and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 accompanying the shadows of the trail and even people you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 have seen 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 planes take off and sit down is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.370
 this airport in germany in hamburg and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 this is the biggest toy airport in 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:33.869
 the world and then after the plane 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.050
 hiding behind a screen he conducts it along 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.570
 circle and start landing by the way here 40 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.040
 airplane model with everything in livery 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 real rowe kampale 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.350
 the place and the Russian aeroflot Transaero 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.600
 count on wait volga days 363 a day 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 not every real report 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 can afford 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 and how do you like these little men there almost 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.210
 5000 imagine to melt and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.330
 Seat these people hopping time necessary 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.390
 It was well, and that you put on quite 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.910
 don't call this toy 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 commitment spent on this toy 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.430
 three and a half million euros 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.430
 no more toy up 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.610
 I want to discuss the second part of the issue 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.970
 the theme of delusions and myths about flights 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.060
 by the way sometimes doge and often flying 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.890
 passengers like experienced you are so well 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.080
 for example often hears that one 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.300
 the plane is comfortable another usually like that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 so in the gang fly much more convenient than in 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.180
 arbat boeing more legroom i'm not 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.360
 so noisy 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.400
 true verbose soft landing about wanga in 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 less shaking from 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.890
 In short, a whole set of nonsense do not believe 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 in fact all this is not so state 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.530
 between the seats does not depend on the model 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 it depends on the airline cabin any 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.700
 the aircraft is always packaged to order and to 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.220
 blood company will decide so line 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.410
 placed the chair most often if you fly 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.510
 close then on such flights place for 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.250
 legs will be copper on long-haul flights instead 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.530
 will be more even scrambled out 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.560
 and no matter what specifically they will dump 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.310
 hits in 3 about the noise usual boeing 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 737 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.800
 airbus a320 rustle about the same in 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.050
 hall and there is rather an important place where you 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.820
 sit on how close the engine feet 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.330
 for example in the front row of the cabin 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.250
 the pilot is always silence tough on 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.440
 hard landing on a soft landing 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.840
 really influence the weather conditions well and 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.820
 the pilot's skill with about the same 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.340
 order at the height of shaking blame 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.959
 weather or rather in the tour damn phenomenon 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.520
 which arises due to the fact that 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.770
 the atmosphere and only the pressure changes 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.120
 temperature direction and wind speed 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.790
 because of this 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.440
 air flow becomes uneven 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.989
 and the airplane 1000 in aeroflot roots tastier 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.400
 than in the whole way too quite true 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.200
 it depends more on 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.690
 from the kitchen of the airport in which to cook 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.550
 food for example there dressed there is a huge 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.470
 kitchen board meals on which 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.440
 do food for heap and dug up 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.530
 Well, the most important myth of the plane is very 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.180
 dangerous they often breaks here 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.800
 imagine how many airplanes are there 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.600
 in the air right now all over the world 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.880
 everybody go where they land 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.950
 another mat offended by disasters 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.379
 happening all over the world can be times 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.699
 per month around 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:22.650
 comparative example with a car only 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.750
 in Russia you are from accidents how many I will go 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.909
 happens people here also turns out if 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.340
 somewhere for a long time with a mole than that 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:32.780
 the most dangerous is the road to the airport is not 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.780
 be afraid to throw it great
