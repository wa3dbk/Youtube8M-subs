although I haven't played it in a while
lately<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.240> played<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.990> long<00:02:10.260> long<00:02:10.500> time<00:02:10.679> ago

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lately but I played a long long time ago

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.330 
lately but I played a long long time ago
and<00:02:12.200> over<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.380> years<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.709> know<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.010> kind<00:02:14.280> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and over the years you know you kind of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150 
and over the years you know you kind of
mix<00:02:14.550> things<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.270> little<00:02:15.420> bit<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.470> what<00:02:17.100> I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
mix things up a little bit so what I

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.010 
mix things up a little bit so what I
just<00:02:17.250> played<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:18.000> kind<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.480> reasonable

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
just played was kind of a reasonable

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.170 
just played was kind of a reasonable
facsimile<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:20.010> what's<00:02:20.340> written<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.030> what

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
facsimile of what's written out and what

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
facsimile of what's written out and what
we're<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> rehearse<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> doubt

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
we're going to rehearse but I doubt

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.880 
we're going to rehearse but I doubt
anyway<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:24.870> take<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.320> tune<00:02:25.620> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
anyway if you just take this tune and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
anyway if you just take this tune and
learn<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.250> note<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.520> note<00:02:27.020> remember<00:02:28.020> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
learn it note for note remember it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.949 
learn it note for note remember it
almost<00:02:29.190> sounds<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.570> we've<00:02:30.780> got

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
almost sounds like you know we've got

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.560 
almost sounds like you know we've got
two<00:02:31.290> independent<00:02:32.070> things<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.420> when

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
two independent things going on but when

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.100 
two independent things going on but when
you<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.900> an<00:02:34.110> alternate<00:02:35.070> bass<00:02:35.310> nut<00:02:35.820> line<00:02:36.240> you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you have an alternate bass nut line you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.390 
you have an alternate bass nut line you
know<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.410> either<00:02:37.560> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.890> have<00:02:37.950> notes

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
know you're either going to have notes

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
know you're either going to have notes
sounding<00:02:39.000> with<00:02:39.239> each<00:02:40.170> bathe<00:02:40.560> snow<00:02:41.220> or<00:02:41.519> on<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
sounding with each bathe snow or on the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.170 
sounding with each bathe snow or on the
upbeat<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.920> other<00:02:44.100> words<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:45.000> either

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
upbeat of it in other words it's either

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.020 
upbeat of it in other words it's either
going<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:46.670> or

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.020 

one<00:02:50.720> or<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> other<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:52.250> almost<00:02:52.550> sounds

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
one or the other so it almost sounds

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:07.790 
one or the other so it almost sounds
independent<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:54.230> really<00:02:54.440> not

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.010 

so<00:03:08.800> anyway<00:03:09.129> let's<00:03:10.120> get<00:03:10.390> into<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> we'll

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
so anyway let's get into it and we'll

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.270 
so anyway let's get into it and we'll
take<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.319> measure<00:03:11.500> by<00:03:11.739> measure<00:03:11.769> here<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.819> go

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
take it measure by measure here we go

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.559 
take it measure by measure here we go
we're<00:03:15.280> starting<00:03:15.700> our<00:03:15.790> introduction<00:03:16.450> on

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
we're starting our introduction on

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.530 
we're starting our introduction on
measure<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:17.140> with<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.370> dream<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.879> G<00:03:19.209> top

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
measure a with just a dream a G top

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.949 
measure a with just a dream a G top
triad<00:03:20.140> right<00:03:20.440> here

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.490 

and<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.160> I'm<00:03:24.519> on<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.450> tenth<00:03:25.959> fret<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and so I I'm on the tenth fret the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.640 
and so I I'm on the tenth fret the
little<00:03:26.680> finger<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:28.330> we<00:03:28.450> take<00:03:28.720> take<00:03:29.470> it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
little finger and then we take take it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.559 
little finger and then we take take it
moving<00:03:30.069> into<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> diminish<00:03:30.849> so<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> keep<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
moving into a diminish so I keep the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.160 
moving into a diminish so I keep the
root<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.410> pull<00:03:33.069> everything<00:03:33.220> down<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:34.209> half

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
root and pull everything down a half

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.589 
root and pull everything down a half
step<00:03:35.410> then<00:03:35.860> we're<00:03:36.610> taking<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.090> automatically

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
step then we're taking it automatically

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.080 
step then we're taking it automatically
down<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.080> F<00:03:38.260> sharp<00:03:38.290> diminished<00:03:38.880> F<00:03:39.880> diminish<00:03:42.090> he

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
down to F sharp diminished F diminish he

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.910 
down to F sharp diminished F diminish he
diminished<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:45.310> then<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.760> g6<00:03:46.709> which<00:03:47.709> is

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
diminished and then to a g6 which is

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.660 
diminished and then to a g6 which is
like<00:03:48.160> this

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
like this

00:03:48.670 --> 00:04:03.839 
like this
a<00:03:48.930> D<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.319> need<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.980> G<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.489> one

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.820 

and<00:04:04.420> then<00:04:05.049> we're<00:04:05.260> going<00:04:05.469> to<00:04:05.650> up<00:04:07.829> 13

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
and then we're going to up 13

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.340 

to<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.460> d13<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:14.360> as<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.420> baseline<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
to a d13 and then as a baseline so the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.750 
to a d13 and then as a baseline so the
first<00:04:16.560> two<00:04:16.709> measures<00:04:16.860> look<00:04:17.310> like<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.750> one
