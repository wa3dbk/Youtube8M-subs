00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
same goes for the crank pulley inspect

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
same goes for the crank pulley inspect
now<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.260> honey<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:11.460> Landrover

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
now this little honey they Landrover

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.109 
now this little honey they Landrover
call<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> static<00:01:13.380> adjuster<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> boa<00:01:14.549> gesture

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
call this static adjuster a boa gesture

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.469 
call this static adjuster a boa gesture
well<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:15.479> basically<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.990> idler<00:01:16.409> alright

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
well there's basically an idler alright

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.170 
well there's basically an idler alright
so<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> hear<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:20.909> noise

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so if you can hear that it's got noise

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.530 
so if you can hear that it's got noise
berries<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> noisy<00:01:22.729> these<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.880> sealed<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.420> can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
berries a noisy these are sealed you can

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
berries a noisy these are sealed you can
see<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> seal<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> other

see the seal in here and on the other

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.310 
see the seal in here and on the other
side<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> has<00:01:28.049> started<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> bleep<00:01:30.320> debris

side and it has started to bleep debris
in<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.400> replace<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in there but you replace it as a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.520 
in there but you replace it as a
magnitude<00:01:33.930> course<00:01:34.430> with<00:01:35.430> something<00:01:35.909> new<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
magnitude course with something new and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.420 
magnitude course with something new and
the<00:01:37.590> same<00:01:37.829> goes<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.579> adjustable<00:01:39.090> idler<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
the same goes for the adjustable idler I

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
the same goes for the adjustable idler I
mean<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.640> wouldn't<00:01:41.939> even<00:01:42.060> bother<00:01:42.270> you're

actually using a secondhand belt ride
this<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> new<00:02:16.239> one

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
this is a new one

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.089 
this is a new one
I<00:02:16.690> thought<00:02:17.230> roll<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.620> round<00:02:17.769> there's<00:02:18.010> no

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
I thought roll it round there's no

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.530 
I thought roll it round there's no
cracks<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.640> there<00:02:20.099> rubber<00:02:21.099> teeth<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.390> it's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
cracks in there rubber teeth and it's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.020 
cracks in there rubber teeth and it's
also<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:23.230> bird<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:24.250> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.489> look<00:02:24.640> at<00:02:24.760> this

example here this bow is had it it's
torn<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:28.930> no<00:02:29.080> good

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
torn it's no good
