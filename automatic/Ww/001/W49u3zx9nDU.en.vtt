00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.669
 Semifinal second game 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.469
 Yup 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.549
 1 to 4 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.570
 Content to throw out Chubu area full power

 Central area transmission or representative 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170

 In Nasdaq comment to keep track of Adobe 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 Say hello to you 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.120
 The next opponent picked up is Kanto but 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.050
 I had no idea at all before this last time 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.190
 I think that you can win that one if Mar 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 You can count on me 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.190
 But what has the General Assembly tax so far since the first Island Station 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.609
 But at that time 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.350
 So it was over there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 This time is more than that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
 I will support Yoshida 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 I will inform you that I think the other side is better 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.080
 smile 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.250
 If I tried to make a decision, this was bad. 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.999
 Underlying or in the middle team 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 I also try to the other party I do not think Kyoto 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.769
 Muffler s Ming 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.660
 A little bit of heart without having won so far with built-in dsp 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.660
 I am 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.349
 Cheer at the front row of two teammates and grandmother after the match 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.349
 I would like to do it for the best eight steps 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.639
 So take advantage of both teams 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.849
 Please stick to the stone
