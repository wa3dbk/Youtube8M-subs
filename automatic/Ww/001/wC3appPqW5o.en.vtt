00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
right now the car looks a bit like the

cheetah

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
cheetah

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.709 
cheetah
I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.130> false<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> adder<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
I think it's as false as the adder but I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
I think it's as false as the adder but I
will<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> test<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> few<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.340> time

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
will have to test this a few more time

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.590 
will have to test this a few more time
after<00:02:06.210> upgrading<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.140> even<00:02:07.500> faster<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
after upgrading it it's even faster and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.380 
after upgrading it it's even faster and
looks<00:02:08.870> insane<00:02:09.740> as<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.430> already<00:02:10.580> said<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.210> is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
