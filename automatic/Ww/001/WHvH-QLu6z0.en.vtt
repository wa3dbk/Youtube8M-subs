00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.439
 then this is our mouse mg 7208 bk 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.689
 it's a three tech model born 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:28.500
 it actually has seven keys at a time. 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 Mermaid propped up inside right? 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 I'm going to ask her to do it now. 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.970
 sensitivity adjustment 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.670
 you can see with the change in color are 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.309
 three colors 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.199
 his car a car made of ice 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.799
 The chubby rope is not 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.589
 easy to break the end of the mouse 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:54.000
 but some criticisms still have to be made 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:58.320
 the and here we have the point of it here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 Mobile tip and robust and not even 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.710
 It's so simple it 's breaking down 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.199
 usb contents 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.740
 he has these is to be right here in front 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.420
 and gave him a problem for me but I 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.150
 I think it was a great one that came 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 because I traded myself for another and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 other video the same problem the cable 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.490
 was broken 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.660
 so I do not have a good experience 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 musical ago here we have three two 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.260
 buttons or I come back I move if it is to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.300
 pages and the third page that the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.800
 group shot the dp and here the scroll lock aa 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.560
 people will also see here some 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.450
 details of him here we have a 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 triple shot of lytham would be three 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.650
 quick clicks right 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.710
 so here is our seven mouse 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.440
 buttons that his box I bought and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.360
 not so long ago i had to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.810
 changing a keyboard will also make a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.970
 video would answer at 59 reais not 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.229
 was expensive of the basket of three deques 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.030
 speed his movement had 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 32 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 There are also here we have some 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.659
 little details here in the box because of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 connection tpi resolution 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:15.840
 he is sensitive so he is a good mouse 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.029
 so as long as what I have pros 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.879
 and cons to talk while you are 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:23.360
 using it worked everything ok but it 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.880
 broke in two days it broke 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.940
 there I went there and traded for another mouse 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.950
 in another two days broke the mouse 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.680
 so really the experience that I 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.080
 I had this mouse was not very cool. 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.390
 so I ended up giving up another mouse 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.960
 here it only really gave I just did the video 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.410
 really to show is not a mouse 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.410
 bad until his seal of approval here 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.810
 it worked everything ok the buttons it 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.570
 It worked, I just really did not like it. 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.910
 this yarn toss of breaking very easy 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.440
 for who is trying to buy 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.930
 one and if I mouse here I would recommend 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.850
 buy powder it might be that you have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.780
 been something minimal as it says 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.450
 broke two mice twice of the wire 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.910
 so try not to be careful not to 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.020
 be breaking the film a wire in it is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.900
 very sensitive 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.940
 here we have the mouse so what? 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.070
 accompanying box in the mouse 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.780
 he does not have much in the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.980
 manual right 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.200
 the amanda donkey is a new user 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.700
 inside the manual there we will see 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.209
 here so little about the buttons on the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.209
 ensuring play is plug in the overview 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.090
 environmentally friendly mouse is a 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.010
 electronic device length 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.780
 free wire that I got wrong here is not good 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.209
 amount of the material of the buttons 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.370
 product lifetime 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.920
 so it's my life today he did not go 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.790
 very high and not only take care of this 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.180
 detail 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.180
 OK
