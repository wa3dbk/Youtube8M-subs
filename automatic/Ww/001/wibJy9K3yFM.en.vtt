by twisting the focus ring the lens is
quite<00:01:36.990> heavy<00:01:37.289> it's<00:01:37.709> comparable<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.609> my<00:01:38.789> 7200

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
quite heavy it's comparable to my 7200

quite heavy it's comparable to my 7200
2.8<00:01:40.819> even<00:01:41.819> though<00:01:41.969> it's<00:01:42.200> substantially

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
2.8 even though it's substantially

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.370 
2.8 even though it's substantially
smaller<00:01:44.359> there's<00:01:45.359> only<00:01:45.539> one<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.109> that<00:01:46.319> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
smaller there's only one thing that I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.309 
smaller there's only one thing that I
dislike<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.609> lens<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.539> really<00:01:49.139> kind

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
dislike about this lens that really kind

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.059 
dislike about this lens that really kind
of<00:01:49.380> bothers<00:01:49.740> me

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
of bothers me

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.969 
of bothers me
there<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> no<00:01:50.729> zoom<00:01:51.509> lock<00:01:51.810> anywhere<00:01:52.499> on<00:01:52.590> some

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there is no zoom lock anywhere on some

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.420 
there is no zoom lock anywhere on some
of<00:01:53.069> my

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
of my

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.070 
of my
so<00:01:55.430> when<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.670> keep<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.030> face<00:01:56.270> down<00:01:56.540> in<00:01:56.689> my<00:01:56.810> think

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
so when I keep it face down in my think

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.070 
so when I keep it face down in my think
tank<00:01:57.340> retrospective<00:01:58.340> 30<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.540> pull<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.990> out

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
tank retrospective 30 and I pull it out

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.170 
tank retrospective 30 and I pull it out
it<00:02:00.320> gets<00:02:00.830> stretched<00:02:01.369> because<00:02:01.580> it's<00:02:01.700> got<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.909> lot

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
it gets stretched because it's got a lot

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.149 
it gets stretched because it's got a lot
of<00:02:02.210> glass<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> lot<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.350> heavy<00:02:03.500> glass<00:02:03.710> up<00:02:03.979> there

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
of glass a lot of heavy glass up there

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.570 
of glass a lot of heavy glass up there
so<00:02:05.000> it's<00:02:05.479> always<00:02:05.900> getting<00:02:06.470> extended<00:02:07.310> by

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
so it's always getting extended by

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370 
so it's always getting extended by
itself<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.030> don't<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.479> or<00:02:08.959> if<00:02:09.259> I'm

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
itself I don't like that or if I'm

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.199 
itself I don't like that or if I'm
haven't<00:02:09.979> been<00:02:10.160> gleaned<00:02:10.369> by<00:02:10.550> my<00:02:10.700> side<00:02:10.940> for<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
haven't been gleaned by my side for a

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.370 
haven't been gleaned by my side for a
little<00:02:11.300> while<00:02:11.510> once<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> while<00:02:12.110> it'll

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
little while once in a while it'll

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.750 
little while once in a while it'll
extend<00:02:12.910> some<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.140> had<00:02:15.319> little<00:02:15.980> focus<00:02:16.580> lot

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
extend some it just had little focus lot

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.530 
extend some it just had little focus lot
that'd<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.120> perfect

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that'd be perfect

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.820 
that'd be perfect
okay<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.319> here's<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> closer<00:02:19.100> view<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:21.260> 24

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
okay so here's a closer view of the 24

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.970 
okay so here's a closer view of the 24

retracted<00:02:29.230> see<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:31.780> focus<00:02:32.780> speed<00:02:35.830> all<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
retracted see here focus speed all the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.979 
retracted see here focus speed all the
way<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.450> really<00:02:41.450> fast

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
way so really fast

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.920 
way so really fast

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
focus really really accurate focus also

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.520 
focus really really accurate focus also
lens<00:02:47.930> hood<00:02:48.200> like<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.530> said<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.860> metal<00:02:49.310> with

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
lens hood like I said it's metal with

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.309 
lens hood like I said it's metal with
velvet<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.799> inside<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.760> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> nice

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:04.030 

cause<00:02:57.319> ice<00:02:59.320> so<00:03:00.790> there<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.769> okay<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:03.829> now

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
cause ice so there it is okay so now

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.740 
cause ice so there it is okay so now
let's<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.579> some<00:03:04.790> sample<00:03:05.000> images<00:03:05.570> that

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
let's go through some sample images that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.410 
let's go through some sample images that
I've<00:03:05.840> taken<00:03:06.079> with<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> carl<00:03:06.950> zeiss<00:03:07.040> 24<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.000> 70

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
2.84 over the last year here just a few

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.819 
2.84 over the last year here just a few
start<00:03:14.359> with<00:03:14.540> like<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> studio<00:03:15.230> shot<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.769> a

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
start with like a studio shot of a

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.150 
start with like a studio shot of a
guitar<00:03:19.209> turned<00:03:20.209> out<00:03:20.359> kind<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.690> cool<00:03:21.160> another

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
guitar turned out kind of cool another

guitar turned out kind of cool another
studio<00:03:22.850> shot<00:03:24.970> labuda<00:03:28.600> snake<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:30.049> slithering

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
studio shot labuda snake just slithering

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.800 
studio shot labuda snake just slithering
across<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.459> lawn<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.940> was<00:03:32.120> able<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.359> run<00:03:32.720> out

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
across the lawn I was able to run out

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.310 
across the lawn I was able to run out
and<00:03:32.900> grab<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:34.030> was<00:03:35.030> at<00:03:35.150> 2.8<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.170> it's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
and grab it I was at 2.8 so it's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.550 
and grab it I was at 2.8 so it's
slightly<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.370> focus<00:03:37.750> there<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.200> slightly

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
slightly out of focus there and slightly

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.050 
slightly out of focus there and slightly
out<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.739> focus<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.730> as<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.150> body<00:03:41.359> slithered

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
out of focus here as the body slithered

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.880 
out of focus here as the body slithered
you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.180> also<00:03:44.329> see<00:03:44.630> how<00:03:44.780> shallow<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
you can also see how shallow that the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.590 
you can also see how shallow that the
depth<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.280> field<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.060> one<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.450> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
depth of field is on this one one of the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.780 
depth of field is on this one one of the
things<00:03:50.630> with<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.170> lens<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.859> bokeh<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.459> only

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
things with this lens the bokeh is only

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.509 
things with this lens the bokeh is only
okay<00:03:53.510> that's<00:03:54.200> good<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:54.769> it's<00:03:54.890> not<00:03:55.069> like

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
okay that's good but it's not like

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.360 
okay that's good but it's not like
beautiful<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:57.109> how<00:03:57.799> they're

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
beautiful you can see it how they're

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.270 
beautiful you can see it how they're
slightly<00:03:59.380> harsh<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.799> see<00:04:01.040> them<00:04:01.130> in

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
slightly harsh you can see them in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:10.360 
slightly harsh you can see them in
certain<00:04:01.760> circumstances<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:04.720> night<00:04:05.720> shot

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.560 

fireworks<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.400> all<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.550> really<00:04:15.030> like<00:04:15.180> this

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
fireworks all in all I really like this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
lens it's the in HDR shot I thought was

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.030 
lens it's the in HDR shot I thought was
kind<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.410> neat<00:04:20.959> here<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.110> kind<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.560> what<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.770> lens

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
kind of neat here is kind of what a lens

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.260 
kind of neat here is kind of what a lens
flare<00:04:23.280> will<00:04:23.610> look<00:04:23.790> like<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:26.610> picks<00:04:27.000> up<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.240> lot

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
flare will look like it picks up a lot

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.030 
flare will look like it picks up a lot
of<00:04:27.480> detail<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.110> usually<00:04:28.530> still<00:04:28.710> able<00:04:28.860> to

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
of detail and is usually still able to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.190 
of detail and is usually still able to
autofocus<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.790> pretty<00:04:30.240> strong<00:04:30.660> lens

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
autofocus with a pretty strong lens

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
really good detail comes out of this

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.010 
really good detail comes out of this
lens<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:56.370> can<00:04:56.550> shoot<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.850> at<00:04:56.970> 2.8<00:04:57.630> all<00:04:57.780> day

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
lens and you can shoot it at 2.8 all day

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:08.770 
lens and you can shoot it at 2.8 all day
long<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.620> looks<00:04:59.510> spectacular<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:02.660> souffle

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.810 

this<00:05:09.780> was<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> model<00:05:10.500> from<00:05:10.740> photowalk<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.790> I

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
this was a model from photowalk that I

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.130 
this was a model from photowalk that I
went<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:14.520> lens<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:15.420> able<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.900> pick<00:05:16.080> up

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
went on this lens is able to pick up

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.500 
went on this lens is able to pick up
detail<00:05:16.740> that's<00:05:16.950> just<00:05:17.160> incredible<00:05:17.610> I'm<00:05:17.730> at<00:05:17.880> 3.2

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
detail that's just incredible I'm at 3.2

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.270 
detail that's just incredible I'm at 3.2
right<00:05:18.900> here<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.320> depth<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.680> field<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:20.010> very

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
right here so the depth of field is very

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.510 
right here so the depth of field is very
shallow<00:05:20.700> but<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.090> locks<00:05:21.360> on<00:05:21.740> focus<00:05:22.740> every<00:05:23.280> time

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
shallow but it locks on focus every time

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.830 
shallow but it locks on focus every time
and<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:25.640> really<00:05:26.640> captures<00:05:26.850> amazing<00:05:27.510> stuff

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
and just really captures amazing stuff

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.630 
and just really captures amazing stuff
you<00:05:28.230> can<00:05:28.380> see<00:05:28.650> here<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.040> depth<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.340> field<00:05:29.520> is

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
you can see here the depth of field is

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.090 
you can see here the depth of field is
so<00:05:29.820> shallow<00:05:30.150> it's<00:05:30.480> out<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.890> starting<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.010> go

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
so shallow it's out of starting to go

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.470 
so shallow it's out of starting to go
out<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.280> focus<00:05:32.400> here<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.120> didn't<00:05:33.330> focus

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
out of focus here but it didn't focus

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480 
out of focus here but it didn't focus
there<00:05:33.930> just<00:05:34.470> because<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.740> focal<00:05:35.100> plane<00:05:35.220> is

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
there just because the focal plane is

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.550 
there just because the focal plane is
going<00:05:35.670> straight<00:05:35.970> down<00:05:36.030> her<00:05:36.270> face<00:05:39.560> eyelashes

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
going straight down her face eyelashes

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.480 
going straight down her face eyelashes
and<00:05:40.830> focus<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:45.330> one<00:05:45.630> she<00:05:46.530> was<00:05:46.650> very<00:05:47.010> strongly

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
and focus this one she was very strongly

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.550 
and focus this one she was very strongly
backlit<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.180> actually<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.140> little<00:05:49.290> bit<00:05:49.470> of

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
backlit and actually a little bit of

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.830 
backlit and actually a little bit of
difficulty<00:05:50.040> locking<00:05:50.850> on<00:05:50.970> focus<00:05:51.420> here<00:05:51.660> for

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
difficulty locking on focus here for

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.140 
difficulty locking on focus here for
some<00:05:51.990> reason<00:05:53.480> this<00:05:54.480> just<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:55.350> show<00:05:55.620> the

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
some reason this just to show the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.610 
some reason this just to show the
blurred<00:05:57.150> out<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.540> bokeh<00:05:57.840> but<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.110> looks<00:05:58.350> like

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
blurred out the bokeh but it looks like

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.940 
blurred out the bokeh but it looks like
focus<00:05:59.370> points<00:05:59.930> right<00:06:00.930> there<00:06:01.140> on<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.410> arm<00:06:01.680> and

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
focus points right there on the arm and

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.090 
focus points right there on the arm and
how<00:06:02.250> it<00:06:02.370> fades<00:06:03.030> off<00:06:04.460> we<00:06:05.460> are<00:06:06.920> detail<00:06:07.920> is

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
how it fades off we are detail is

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:17.560 
how it fades off we are detail is
incredible<00:06:09.920> another<00:06:10.920> one<00:06:11.190> eyes<00:06:12.650> beautiful

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.980
