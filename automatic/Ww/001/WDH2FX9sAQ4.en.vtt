00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 in general manga begins 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.599
 fun since came oh huh 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.200
 quantity 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 superstrong people who are capable 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.500
 return the island to heram to demolish and it is very 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 interesting because how loki will 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 fight him harder or luffy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.880
 them and in general what they will do if 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.349
 weaker for me so very interesting 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.739
 shows a new admiral who 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.980
 taken down easily cuts down the adviser 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 Bartholomew 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.440
 and throws it in the toilet washes his hands 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.059
 like everything and pontah so all with him 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.410
 done in just a couple of minutes 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:55.350
 toilet lying around beaten by himself 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 Bartholomew and you Che seems to me not to take 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.820
 for admirals are any wimps and I 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 I think that he was very strong 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.290
 stronger smoker example or cable or 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.409
 as strong as luffy but god cut 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 I do not know by force but he was lying in the end 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.330
 after a couple of minutes it says only the most 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 the fact that I do not know what power I will give 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.720
 was but it is very cruel 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.869
 as I used to say and the old man wears 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.750
 white clothes and look like a watch on 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.119
 maybe he's new shichibukai but no i 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 he was mistaken the new admiral even this 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 very interesting now his strength yet 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.210
 more interesting because he wants the whole 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.270
 crisis under the ground for herachit with all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.909
 us with the pirates the strongest because 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 what did he ask how many people are there 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.210
 commissions 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.790
 how much dung are you possible the whole island 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.689
 wants to sink herams because he 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.299
 said that the victims will be in any 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.729
 the case of the doctors look for all the things that is 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.940
 not that global mesilovo is possible 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.010
 just the whole island is destroyed on 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.240
 and it's kind of very interesting because he 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 you said correctly 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.730
 coupe and then I liked something and I 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.810
 Now we will call each other our names 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.950
 maybe it will end badly with a lupi 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 says a yamaha Novels for attendants not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 power in the comp starts and that would be 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:47.540
 cool could not put anything 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:52.610
 no one from admiral logia but now 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 to have the will of all three even plus 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.300
 fruit has improved abilities with 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.010
 more came up with new different and therefore 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.160
 is it possible that bows water no no 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.000
 interesting guys because not always 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.180
 did the pirate king run away 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.600
 roger he is always admirals and nothing 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:23.630
 terrible in general 03 appears to himself 09 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.310
 and myself 8764 they are divided as well as recession than 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.320
 the smaller the number the stronger 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.140
 the strongest squad appeared 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.040
 division on the island even he says 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.010
 that it sucks because if they 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 appeared here means either islands 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.840
 will pipets 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.140
 or something bad happens to him, I 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.620
 agrees also I said in the past 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.590
 led 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.150
 if there are too many people on the team 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.180
 we are the ends of him more than 20 characters 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.320
 we stupidly will not see for the head of all we 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.600
 we will not miss the characters 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 will have letters 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.890
 will have to come up with a lot of different 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.230
 plots 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.510
 many different types of plot discrepancy 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.630
 plot so they overlap select 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.480
 how it was connected and it would be stupid 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.190
 new draft will send 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.590
 this shows all the rules about by 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.250
 Liza practice shows and how he learns 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.960
 with this little man manual factory 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.530
 show the gaze that saw the fairy 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.900
 which nobody has ever seen yet your 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.990
 sanji who flirts with a girl couple 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.570
 snipe the sniper 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.200
 Pokemon shows that he was kidnapped 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.660
 well, or trying to steal the victory bridge 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.880
 some of which are inhabited by fish 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.880
 drown all the ships and kill everyone who 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.610
 it passes and on which island 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.950
 caused sea patrol reinforcements 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.570
 Which most likely you ointment and soot 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.910
 also everything seems to be northern 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.230
 any insertion until at least 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.570
 most and then characters and they like 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.720
 would not really affect the plot but but 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.330
 still showed almost the entire team and this 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.150
 cool in general it will be interesting to see and 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.340
 they all roughly seem to be like 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.160
 hotel king gonna show 100 taught them 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.520
 what happened what happened in general 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.710
 interesting to look at the total cost came 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.180
 as always interesting and this is only the beginning 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.550
 arches a in the middle and in the very epilogue 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.300
 completion of the battle will begin and I do not know 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.300
 which are strong and cool because how 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.320
 it always happens and I'm just sure that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:56.760
 will be the coolest chapter possible and the most 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:56.760
 I personally really do appreciate on 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.550
 that's all with you was Sasha see you and 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.550
 week all bye
