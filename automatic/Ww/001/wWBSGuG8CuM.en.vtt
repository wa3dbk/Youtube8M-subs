00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.329
 first notice that man-made 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.939
 subjects are suspiciously small in comparison 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.750
 with insects then stumble upon 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.180

 own society here's your grandmother and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.009
 Fallout per day while the game itself 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.920
 neatly fits into the framework of the genre 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.829
 johnny off-road classic pseudo 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.630

 well-deserved video and on in a circle 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:20.790
 It is worth noting that the decision is usually very 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700
 logical and the protagonist is always 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.370
