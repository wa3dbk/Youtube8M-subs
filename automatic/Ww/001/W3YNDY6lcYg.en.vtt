00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.710 
to tell you the retirement date right
right<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.740> next<00:00:17.160> inspection<00:00:17.520> date<00:00:17.850> right

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
right the next inspection date right

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.220 
right the next inspection date right
when<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> last<00:00:19.890> inspection<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.640> correct<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
when the last inspection was correct and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
when the last inspection was correct and
so<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.900> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> these

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
so what we have here is one of these

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.870 
so what we have here is one of these
reports<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.769> has<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.310> data<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reports this has all that data on it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
reports this has all that data on it
isn't<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:27.810> okay<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.250> why<00:00:29.369> don't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
isn't that right right okay so why don't

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.500 
isn't that right right okay so why don't
