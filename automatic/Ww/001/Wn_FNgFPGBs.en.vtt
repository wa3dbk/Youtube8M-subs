00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
soil we begin to think about how we're

going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.209> use<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.899> soil<00:01:49.109> may<00:01:49.319> say<00:01:49.530> well<00:01:49.709> for

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
going to use the soil may say well for

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.800 
going to use the soil may say well for
some<00:01:50.100> plants<00:01:50.459> I<00:01:50.609> want<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> potting<00:01:51.389> soil<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
some plants I want the potting soil the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.809 
some plants I want the potting soil the
way<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.139> is<00:01:52.350> perhaps<00:01:53.009> I've<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.520> something

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
way it is perhaps I've got something

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.219 
way it is perhaps I've got something
that<00:01:53.909> likes<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.209> lot<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> organic<00:01:54.719> matter<00:01:54.869> so

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that likes a lot of organic matter so

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.629 
that likes a lot of organic matter so
I'll<00:01:55.319> grow<00:01:55.499> it<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.679> straight<00:01:55.920> compost<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
I'll grow it in straight compost so

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.879 
I'll grow it in straight compost so
that's<00:01:56.819> not<00:01:56.969> always<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.359> good<00:01:57.539> idea<00:01:57.990> sometimes

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
that's not always a good idea sometimes

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.559 
that's not always a good idea sometimes
we'll<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.130> though<00:01:59.249> I<00:01:59.279> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> blend<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
we'll say though I want to blend it so

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.569 
we'll say though I want to blend it so
I'll<00:02:00.659> blend<00:02:00.929> it<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.170> soil<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.219> sharp

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
I'll blend it with soil or with sharp

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.239 
I'll blend it with soil or with sharp
sand<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.810> growing<00:02:04.079> cacti<00:02:04.319> or<00:02:04.889> other

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
plants which like well-drained soils

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.339 
plants which like well-drained soils
I'll<00:02:07.499> mix<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.889> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.159> sand<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> soil<00:02:09.349> if

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
I'll mix a lot of sand with the soil if

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.539 
I'll mix a lot of sand with the soil if
I'm<00:02:10.500> growing<00:02:10.769> something<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.250> needs<00:02:11.430> more

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
I'm growing something that needs more

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.390 
I'm growing something that needs more
moisture<00:02:11.790> I'll<00:02:12.150> put<00:02:12.360> less<00:02:12.599> sand<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
moisture I'll put less sand in it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.360 
moisture I'll put less sand in it
I<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.610> add<00:02:13.760> perlite<00:02:14.269> I<00:02:14.599> can<00:02:15.079> add<00:02:15.260> small<00:02:15.829> gravel

the soil to tailor that soil to my needs

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.059 
the soil to tailor that soil to my needs
and<00:02:20.360> once<00:02:20.900> I've<00:02:21.019> done<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.379> also<00:02:21.620> look<00:02:21.950> and

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
and once I've done that I also look and

say well what am I going to plant it in

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.390 
say well what am I going to plant it in
well<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.959> can<00:02:24.140> use<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.530> flower<00:02:24.709> pots<00:02:25.040> now<00:02:25.250> this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
well I can use the flower pots now this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.100 
well I can use the flower pots now this
is<00:02:25.549> one<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.909> has<00:02:25.970> been<00:02:26.090> used<00:02:26.239> before<00:02:26.599> it's

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
is one that has been used before it's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.380 
is one that has been used before it's
important<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.709> clean<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.159> wash<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.970> out<00:02:29.090> very

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
important to clean it wash it out very

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720 
important to clean it wash it out very
well<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.439> good<00:02:30.620> idea<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.220> rinse<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.579> with<00:02:31.700> a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
well and a good idea to rinse it with a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.580 
well and a good idea to rinse it with a
ten<00:02:32.000> percent<00:02:32.299> chlorine<00:02:32.720> bleach<00:02:32.989> solution

ten percent chlorine bleach solution

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.170 
ten percent chlorine bleach solution
which<00:02:33.769> means<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.129> take<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.609> part<00:02:34.849> chlorine

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
which means you take one part chlorine

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.179 
which means you take one part chlorine
bleach<00:02:35.420> nine<00:02:35.989> parts<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.500> water<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.980> make<00:02:37.159> a

device I found in a fast food store a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.700 
device I found in a fast food store a
hot<00:04:34.160> dog<00:04:34.370> came<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:34.850> one<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:36.380> use<00:04:36.560> this

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
hot dog came in this one I can use this

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.920 
hot dog came in this one I can use this
as<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:36.920> greenhouse<00:04:37.400> or<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.180> can<00:04:38.390> use<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.660> as<00:04:38.750> to

as a greenhouse or I can use it as to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.750 
as a greenhouse or I can use it as to
planting<00:04:39.290> trays<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.160> I've<00:04:40.310> got<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.520> lot<00:04:40.730> of

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
planting trays so I've got a lot of

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.150 
planting trays so I've got a lot of
flexibility<00:04:41.390> with<00:04:41.600> these<00:04:41.810> so<00:04:42.650> as<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:42.920> look

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
flexibility with these so as we look

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160 
flexibility with these so as we look
we've<00:04:43.340> got<00:04:43.520> soil<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.180> containers<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.990> work

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
we've got soil and containers to work

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.280 
we've got soil and containers to work
with<00:04:45.410> we<00:04:46.190> can<00:04:46.310> be<00:04:46.400> creative<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:47.360> can<00:04:47.630> reuse

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
with we can be creative we can reuse

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.110 
with we can be creative we can reuse
things<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.130> we<00:04:49.220> had<00:04:49.310> otherwise<00:04:49.580> throw<00:04:49.910> away

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
things that we had otherwise throw away

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.520 
things that we had otherwise throw away
so<00:04:50.180> we<00:04:50.390> can<00:04:50.480> get<00:04:50.540> extra<00:04:50.870> use<00:04:51.050> out<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.380> these

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
so we can get extra use out of these

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.500 
so we can get extra use out of these
things<00:04:51.740> now<00:04:52.610> let's<00:04:52.790> not<00:04:52.910> forget<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.270> we<00:04:53.480> need

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
things now let's not forget that we need
