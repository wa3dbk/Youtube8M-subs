if this game lasts longer than five or
six<00:02:18.489> minutes<00:02:18.760> sometimes<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.269> can<00:02:19.420> go<00:02:19.570> with<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
six minutes sometimes you can go with a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.550 
six minutes sometimes you can go with a
surprise<00:02:21.180> surprise<00:02:22.180> kill<00:02:22.750> if<00:02:23.079> you<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.350> like

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
surprise surprise kill if you have like

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.900 
surprise surprise kill if you have like
a<00:02:23.709> little<00:02:24.040> bit<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.310> higher<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.640> would<00:02:24.760> run

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
a little bit of higher but would run

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.729 
a little bit of higher but would run
because<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.150> won't<00:02:25.239> expect<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:26.049> it

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
because they won't expect that but it

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.349 
because they won't expect that but it
also<00:02:26.920> depends<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.340> which<00:02:27.489> side<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> think

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
also depends on which side here I think

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:28.660 
also depends on which side here I think
that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.339 
that
radiant<00:02:29.660> actually<00:02:29.959> has<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> slight

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
radiant actually has a slight

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.199 
radiant actually has a slight
disadvantage<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.250> matchup<00:02:31.910> because

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
disadvantage in this matchup because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.030 
disadvantage in this matchup because
you're<00:02:32.540> closer<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.080> trees<00:02:33.319> much<00:02:33.860> more

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
you're closer to the trees much more

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.339 
you're closer to the trees much more
likely<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.459> shot<00:02:34.520> yes<00:02:35.150> especially<00:02:36.020> from

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
likely to get shot yes especially from

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.199 
likely to get shot yes especially from
the<00:02:36.410> back<00:02:36.560> put<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.830> more<00:02:37.160> likely<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.580> run<00:02:37.940> into

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
the back put you more likely to run into

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.580 
the back put you more likely to run into
a<00:02:38.239> shuffle<00:02:38.840> shot<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.700> other<00:02:40.700> things

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
a shuffle shot there but other things

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.470 
a shuffle shot there but other things
I'm<00:02:42.590> looking<00:02:43.069> at<00:02:43.310> looking<00:02:43.520> at<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.300> other

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
I'm looking at looking at the the other

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.970 
I'm looking at looking at the the other
build<00:02:44.690> focus<00:02:45.080> fire<00:02:45.290> do<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.590> think<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:45.830> should

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
build focus fire do you think you should

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.440 
build focus fire do you think you should
be<00:02:46.040> looking<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.520> at<00:02:46.700> level<00:02:46.819> 6<00:02:47.209> it's

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
be looking to get that at level 6 it's

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.300 
be looking to get that at level 6 it's
75<00:02:47.930> minor<00:02:48.200> cost<00:02:48.410> now<00:02:48.590> at<00:02:48.650> level<00:02:48.920> 1<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
75 minor cost now at level 1 is a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.090 
75 minor cost now at level 1 is a
worthwhile<00:02:49.850> or<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> still<00:02:50.750> uh<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:51.770> quite

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
worthwhile or is it still uh not quite

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.490 
worthwhile or is it still uh not quite
I<00:02:52.370> don't<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.750> shackle<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.260> just

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I don't think so you shackle is just

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.140 
I don't think so you shackle is just
really<00:02:54.860> important<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.280> have<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.880> gives<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
really important to have it gives you a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.210 
really important to have it gives you a
lot<00:02:56.269> more<00:02:56.330> uptime<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.040> majority<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.130> your

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
lot more uptime and a majority of your

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.589 
lot more uptime and a majority of your
damage<00:02:58.519> will<00:02:58.670> be<00:02:58.700> from<00:02:58.940> power<00:02:59.120> shot<00:02:59.360> early

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
damage will be from power shot early

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.910 
damage will be from power shot early
because<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.380> win<00:03:00.560> running<00:03:00.769> up<00:03:00.860> they

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
because you can just win running up they

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.710 
because you can just win running up they
focus<00:03:01.250> fire<00:03:01.430> not<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> big<00:03:01.940> deal<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.450> full<00:03:02.630> with

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
region already spent that's one over

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.220 
region already spent that's one over
like<00:05:07.640> two<00:05:07.910> hundred<00:05:08.120> seventy-five<00:05:08.780> gold<00:05:09.050> right

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
like two hundred seventy-five gold right

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.710 
like two hundred seventy-five gold right
there<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.650> that's<00:05:10.190> not<00:05:10.910> quite<00:05:11.180> half<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.420> bottle

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
there and that's not quite half a bottle

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.180 
there and that's not quite half a bottle
but<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:12.170> still<00:05:12.290> pretty<00:05:12.410> close<00:05:12.680> look<00:05:12.950> at<00:05:13.040> the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
but it's still pretty close look at the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.650 
but it's still pretty close look at the
net<00:05:13.340> worth<00:05:13.520> difference<00:05:13.940> it's<00:05:14.090> like<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.270> three

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
net worth difference it's like a three

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.090 
net worth difference it's like a three
hundred<00:05:14.780> network<00:05:15.260> difference<00:05:15.680> even<00:05:16.040> though

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
there's one CS between them are very

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.930 
there's one CS between them are very
