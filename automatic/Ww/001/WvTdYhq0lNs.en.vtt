00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.840
 the dead I am air comet and welcome to 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 other weapons guides in GT this time 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.370
 Sincerely, we are facing 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.350
 the most beastly revelation in all to call 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.940
 of duty people are active of an idea 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.140
 of what it would be before trying it but 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.370
 we have been final must have 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 surprised even the very one 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.940
 treyarch and we go with the guide fall or sw 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.250
 the fn false his real name is the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 selective fire assault more 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.450
 story that you think of was 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.310
 designed in the late 40's by fn 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 herstal between energetic and published to 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.630
 from in 1953 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.280
 from the first model then with 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 hardly modifications are followed 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.360
 using the news and apparently 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.530
 in the future also good without more 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.530
 procrastination let's go with the fall 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.960
 the phallus sw is an assault rifle that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.280
 we can use once we reach the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 level 22 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 we will be had a mathematical position of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.720
 high damage and precision throughout the room 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.250
 Carlos cutiÃ±o but this was 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.600
 we will find it exclusively 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 different from the rest for a condition 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.090
 only we will see later 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.680
 at the moment their states are normal 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.970
 within this type of weapons with damage 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 high that will kill two shots of very 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 close just 17 meters and from there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 we will always kill three shots 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.620
 let's shoot where we will visit except if 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.540
 we point to the head that given its 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.910
 multiplier of 1.2 we will reduce the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.520
 shots needed in one the precision 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.870
 what I 'm going to say about her is nothing 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 exaggerated if we say that the detour is 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.280
 null completely or at least in the mode 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 semi-automatic in this type of shot 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.150
 the maximum cadence that we can 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
 get 625 shovels per minute but 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.690
 I do not think anyone has a finger 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.280
 pajillero the closer we will have to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680
 our disposition is 25 bullets 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.170
 although they are not the usual 30 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 being a weapon of so much damage besides the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.440
 recharge time is not bad of 2 with 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 15 seconds connected here there are no screams 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.770
 consists of the empty magazine but 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.180
 we emptied the spare charger and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.820
 really excellent recharging time 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.860
 so look with that data the pattern of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.170
 recoil, as you can see in 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.030
 our newtown wall is almost 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.760
 imperceptible in semiautomatic mode and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.380
 a tad more noticeable in automatic mode 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.450
 well let's see how to get the best out of the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.450
 fahl we can really get it out 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.709
 in the part of the accessories I think 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.990
 I'm going to say obviousness selector voltage 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.150
 of shooting that is surprise I do not think that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.260
 we all imagined the weapons 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.910
 semiautomatic devices have always been 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.410
 pretty good but sometimes not 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.270
 they could face the rest for this 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.860
 simple fact that the damage and accuracy 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.450
 that they have to turn them into automatic 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.700
 it's like having a turbo command and it's the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.709
 host 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.349
 it does not matter if the cadence is reduced 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.390
 this case 468 for das by minutes but 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.580
 you see that there are too many 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.140
 the recoil is barely existent they say 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.569
 that have gone up because before he was not moving 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.099
 but it's too light yet with this 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.380
 two will be goddesses in short and medium 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.819
 distances and a hard rival in long not 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.190
 you have to worry about nothing except 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.069
 the ammunition but that we will fix it 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.319
 in the advantages section 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.959
 if we really are good with the trigger 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.150
 Forget the shooting selector to choose 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.349
 running the muffler can that to 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.269
 At first sight, do not look like 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.400
 excessively effective but increase a 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.409
 all those that have already been few meters 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.689
 we will kill two shots we believe 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.920
 that is not a great sacrifice besides with 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.269
 the silencer will be murderers 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.859
 undercover and we will not have to 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.870
 worry about appearing on the radar 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.270
 enemy when firing a great accessory 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.340
 definitely 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.620
 The fast charger is our excellent 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.270
 although we already recharged very fast with this one 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.850
 but we will further reduce the time of 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.610
 recharge reaching the interesting 15 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.560
 seconds putting on speed to a 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.000
 really great damage we will get a 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.710
 beast that will work well in almost 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.910
 any situation as many friends 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.800
 that have 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.030
 since founded rapids something that will help 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.050
 very much at the time of reacting before 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.640
 enemies 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.990
 we will aim quicker which is 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.060
 really necessary considering 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.200
 that this weapon is based on his aim that 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.670
 Do not be afraid to spend a point of 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.010
 class in this accessory because it will come to you 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.780
 of pearls that I am combining with others 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.120
 is now better so we will multiply your 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.699
 effectiveness 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.560
 and well what little more to add here a 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.910
 peephole always comes very well to taste 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.320
 but I assure you that enhance the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.360
 accuracy of this very good weapon 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.590
 choice the average iron can disturb 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.100
 sometimes although it works 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.990
 efficient 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.090
 therefore any sight is recommended 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.620
 although if we had to choose us 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.289
 we would decant we go for the point look 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.210
 Red 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.680
 what else can you ask for is unlocked at 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.539
 principle and it's very clear and it has a zoom 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.020
 very light so as not to lose battles 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.020
 short distances 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.460
 as for the advantages in the first 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.020
 slot with which the best would be a 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.580
 bulletproof vest option as the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.050
 explosions should be the last thing we 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.210
 we must worry not to miss shot 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.000
 it goes well with this advantage we will leave this 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.250
 parked problem 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.520
 in the second section the master option 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.710
 study the precision must be spotless 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.150
 there is a failure can mean death in 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.040
 the automatic option may not have 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.529
 both weight but in semi-automatic mode 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.779
 it is something indispensable 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.579
 and as a third advantage tactical mask 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.019
 is the chosen option for some forces 

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:36.659
 with the advantage of bulletproof vest 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.579
 engineer is not bad but if it is not something 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.869
 that you care too much to the point 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:41.869
 in something that is really interested 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.240
 and here are our classes 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.590
 recommended with the fal really 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.389
 There are many combinations that 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.490
 they work perfectly but we highlight 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.870
 you are for your balance although you know 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.800
 that the best classes are the best 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.800
 they work for you 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:05.169
 and good the summary that is this that chito 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.280
 no change is expected as 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.539
 spectacular in weapons 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.909
 semi-automatic in this game 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.550
 especially in the fall since the smn 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.680
 like he has not had so much weight 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.150
 has almost real teacher great damage is 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.099
 unlocks a low level and is very 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.350
 manageable to the true experts 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.690
 among which includes 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.460
 we recommend you do not use the accessory 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.410
 rich shot selector for moss a lot the 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.289
 cadence and if we really are good with 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.059
 the trigger will not be able to stop us 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.279
 with all these compliments we let go 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:35.259
 to fal the only bad thing we can say 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:39.129
 it is already your charger a small between 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:40.779
 quotes of only 25 bullets so in the 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.349
 theory we put 9 and in practice 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:46.749
 another 9 because it's the one we studied 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:50.610
 what is to say with this it would be nice to miss 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:50.610
 more no more clear 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.220
 it does not seem to approximate with the skin 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.220
 skipper alone in the gp 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.769
 this
