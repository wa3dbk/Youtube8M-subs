range<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.760> I'm<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:48.940> great<00:00:49.239> believer<00:00:49.420> in<00:00:49.809> if<00:00:50.320> you

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
range and I'm a great believer in if you

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.349 
range and I'm a great believer in if you
get<00:00:50.710> used<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.190> pattern<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.699> float<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.179> get

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
get used to a pattern of a float you get

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.610 
get used to a pattern of a float you get
to<00:00:52.480> now<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.809> behaves<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:54.160> can<00:00:54.309> always<00:00:54.609> pick<00:00:54.879> up

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to now it behaves you can always pick up

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.740 
to now it behaves you can always pick up
so<00:00:56.620> many<00:00:57.280> more<00:00:57.370> fish<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.820> see<00:00:58.000> more<00:00:58.449> bites

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
so many more fish you see more bites

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.000 
so many more fish you see more bites
that<00:00:58.929> you<00:00:58.989> do<00:00:59.199> when<00:00:59.379> you're<00:00:59.440> familiar<00:00:59.620> with<00:00:59.890> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
that you do when you're familiar with a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.470 
that you do when you're familiar with a
float<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.489> if<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.670> keep<00:01:00.879> constantly

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
float that if you keep constantly

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.529 
float that if you keep constantly
changing<00:01:01.929> your<00:01:02.050> different<00:01:02.410> patterns<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
changing your different patterns of

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.450 
changing your different patterns of
course<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:04.899> use<00:01:05.259> a<00:01:05.289> very<00:01:05.500> strong<00:01:05.860> stable<00:01:06.100> float

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
course I use a very strong stable float

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.859 
course I use a very strong stable float
say<00:01:07.210> carbon<00:01:07.509> stem<00:01:07.929> sits<00:01:08.530> perfectly<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:10.570> with

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
say carbon stem sits perfectly with with

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.169 
say carbon stem sits perfectly with with
a<00:01:10.899> ripple<00:01:11.229> on<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.350> water<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.950> there<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.030> with

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
a ripple on the water and there and with

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.570 
a ripple on the water and there and with
that<00:01:13.330> hollow<00:01:13.539> tip<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.920> really<00:01:15.310> really

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
that hollow tip it's really really

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.180 
that hollow tip it's really really
visible<00:01:16.319> not<00:01:17.319> very<00:01:17.500> often<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.890> need<00:01:18.069> to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
visible not very often do I need to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.370 
visible not very often do I need to

black these out to be fair they do show

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.120 
black these out to be fair they do show

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
my shot in patterns this one actually

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.609 
my shot in patterns this one actually
he's<00:01:43.630> just<00:01:43.840> shot<00:01:43.990> he<00:01:44.110> didn't<00:01:44.320> just<00:01:44.439> like<00:01:44.590> a

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
nice spread bulk style which is then

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.289 
nice spread bulk style which is then
quite<00:01:47.560> easily<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.950> change<00:01:48.280> if<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.490> feel<00:01:48.729> it
