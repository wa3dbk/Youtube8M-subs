that's really kind of now making it as

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.250 
that's really kind of now making it as
just<00:04:00.550> because<00:04:00.760> I'm<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.090> more<00:04:01.360> traditional<00:04:02.050> I

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
just because I'm a more traditional I

mindset that it's not gonna be that and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.140 
mindset that it's not gonna be that and
for<00:04:12.070> me<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:12.250> very<00:04:12.490> hard<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.760> distinguish

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
for me it's very hard to distinguish

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.760 
for me it's very hard to distinguish
that<00:04:13.330> that's<00:04:13.870> why<00:04:13.990> I'm<00:04:14.320> probably<00:04:14.590> being

unfair on on this and that's why I'm

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320 
unfair on on this and that's why I'm
