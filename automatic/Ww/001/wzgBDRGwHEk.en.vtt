00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:12.200
 They too, but I'll say a little bit 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:15.320
 about glasses is and I got my 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.789
 performance today I'm loving it, it 's very 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.939
 cute example 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.800
 so I decided to do a makeup for 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.529
 girls who wear glasses 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.199
 thus to combine with frame and 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.499
 match with eye color and such 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.790
 so I decided to make good girls then 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.890
 Let's start what I'm going to do is 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.000
 a collective of the team that I won from 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.260
 my agenda 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.090
 the first thing we'll do 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.550
 you use s 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.190
 and if on the day maybe more clarinha like this is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.920
 a little saint laurent 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.990
 so we'll pick up this insel 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.470
 machine gun 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.100
 then stop was entire moving eyelid 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.100
 of the eye 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 now we get it, I think the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.429
 planet 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.289
 I'll get some of the black I'm going 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.289
 pass here just in the corner of the eye 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.710
 buy first we 'll smoke it 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 This is killing people but not smoking. 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 The orange I told you is wrong. 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.369
 okay is that in we inform all I 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280
 Tell him that you're going to smoke. 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 come out close know that this is with the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.000
 own finger 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:30.280
 Ahmed is following the team vane 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 I'm going to take this is a street here with 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.739
 avon brush 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.239
 I'm going to do it just like this, I'm going to hit 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.980
 This white is so clear here. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.579
 to take this effect more by feeling 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.579
 before him 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.439
 with the bevelled brush we'll hit 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.769
 here in black and goes around the line 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.840
 water to leave the eye cult well 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.590
 marked by paying attention 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.590
 under the eyes 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.420
 I want to do the same thing here in 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.340
 mobile eyelid close to eyelashes who 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.510
 you well in this region can also make 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.510
 anything else with it 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.579
 up to half the eyes 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:03.440
 then the same brush let's fight more 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.800
 and we'll do the other half of the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.800
 eye 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.930
 just the corner 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:22.239
 Let's get the brown that brushstrokes and 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.239
 let's go over white 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.190
 number since we had a 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.190
 scoundrel 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.550
 I thought of them 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:58.320
 to finish using the right river in 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:04.170
 singing is good I always use but not 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.450
 Let's abuse this time because in my 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.910
 If so, or if it is too large then 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.560
 When I put the frame he hits it. 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:16.020
 bell rings on the uncomfortable allende 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.960
 getting dirty is clear while it's time 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.140
 So it 's just a brushstroke up and down. 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.140
 low 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.399
 to finish the blush I also recorded that 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.360
 coming here 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:34.360
 light hand 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:55.759
 e and 12 of the level he as agent not 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.960
 warned the time we can abuse a 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.370
 little in the mouth 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.999
 he's a little coeli 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.999
 vermilion 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.539
 this boys with glasses 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.110
 Is it done that you can leave? 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.460
 It's a joker makeup. 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.340
 you can use both for the day and 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.810
 for the night and if you want to use it during 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.610
 Night you can change. 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.849
 the lipstick I passed a biological clock 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.039
 in red color and if you want you can 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.319
 pass the button itself and half with 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.169
 That song I 've already spent Christmas 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.840
 but pink is a makeup that combines with 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.629
 any type of button and also with 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.969
 any type of occasion 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.560

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.250
 Judge you may have if you did not like it and mouths in the 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.610
 moral of those who do not like to look 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.409
 girl thinking she says she's 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.319
