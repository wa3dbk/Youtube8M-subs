00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
totally guitars it's part of the target

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.670 
totally guitars it's part of the target
program<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.119> what<00:01:10.570> we<00:01:10.660> do<00:01:10.810> in<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.020> lesson<00:01:11.470> is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
program and what we do in the lesson is

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.520 
program and what we do in the lesson is
work<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.840> important<00:01:14.289> thing<00:01:14.410> and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
work on just the important thing and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.840 
work on just the important thing and
this<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.649> hitting<00:01:14.950> bass<00:01:15.190> notes<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.700> getting

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
this is hitting bass notes and getting

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.010 
this is hitting bass notes and getting
accurate<00:01:16.270> with<00:01:16.509> them<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:16.750> we<00:01:16.840> talked<00:01:16.990> about

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
accurate with them so we talked about

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.410 
accurate with them so we talked about
some<00:01:17.200> techniques<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.340> need<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:19.210> get

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
some techniques that you need to get

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.600 
some techniques that you need to get
clean<00:01:20.289> bass<00:01:20.560> notes<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.009> he'll<00:01:21.100> not<00:01:21.280> sound

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
clean bass notes and he'll not sound

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.870 
clean bass notes and he'll not sound
like<00:01:21.820> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.200 

that's<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.600> sound<00:01:26.780> little<00:01:27.460> soft<00:01:28.460> blue<00:01:28.790> grassy

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's the sound little soft blue grassy

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.030 
that's the sound little soft blue grassy
kind<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.720> picking<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.500> it's<00:01:30.650> important<00:01:30.979> that

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
kind of picking so it's important that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.550 
kind of picking so it's important that
to<00:01:31.400> angle<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.060> pick<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.570> certain<00:01:33.110> way<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.409> make

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
to angle the pick a certain way and make

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.170 
to angle the pick a certain way and make
sure<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.830> angle<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.400> up<00:01:34.580> generally<00:01:35.060> when

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
sure that angle it up generally when

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.520 
sure that angle it up generally when
you're<00:01:35.240> hitting<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.570> note<00:01:35.690> says<00:01:35.930> downs<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
you're hitting the note says downs and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.999 
you're hitting the note says downs and
that<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.640> get<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:38.960> come<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.200> wrist<00:01:39.590> on

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that you get that you come to wrist on

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.469 
that you get that you come to wrist on
the<00:01:40.040> next<00:01:40.369> string<00:01:40.610> using<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.030> string<00:01:41.299> in<00:01:41.390> this

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
the next string using the string in this

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.660 
the next string using the string in this
case<00:01:41.540> I'm<00:01:41.840> using<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.110> fifth<00:01:42.409> string<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.310> stop

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
case I'm using the fifth string to stop

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.389 
case I'm using the fifth string to stop
the<00:01:44.240> pick<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.530> hit<00:01:45.680> just<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.100> sixth

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
the pick so that I hit just the sixth

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.620 
the pick so that I hit just the sixth
string<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.700> don't<00:01:46.850> get<00:01:46.909> this<00:01:47.090> kind<00:01:47.390> of<00:01:47.479> sound

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
string and don't get this kind of sound

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.870 
string and don't get this kind of sound
where<00:01:48.110> I've<00:01:48.200> got<00:01:48.350> too<00:01:48.649> many<00:01:48.799> notes<00:01:49.039> sounding

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
where I've got too many notes sounding

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.580 
where I've got too many notes sounding
so<00:01:50.119> anyway<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:50.990> lesson<00:01:51.259> we<00:01:51.320> go<00:01:51.409> through

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
so anyway in the lesson we go through

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.469 
so anyway in the lesson we go through
the<00:01:51.649> chord<00:01:51.830> progression<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the chord progression and you the

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.999 
the chord progression and you the
beginning<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:54.049> very<00:01:54.289> easy<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.710> course<00:01:54.890> opens

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
beginning is very easy the course opens

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.789 
beginning is very easy the course opens
up<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.399> C<00:01:55.700> chord<00:01:56.000> slid<00:01:56.899> up<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.560> third

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
up with a C chord slid up to the third

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.580 
up with a C chord slid up to the third
fret<00:01:58.100> making<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.850> kind<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.869> exotic<00:02:00.319> member

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
fret making it a kind of exotic member

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.919

of the D family but we have a little bit

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.330 
of the D family but we have a little bit
of<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.050> theory<00:02:03.229> breakdown<00:02:03.679> of<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:03.860> too<00:02:04.159> or

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
of a theory breakdown of that too or

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.580 
of a theory breakdown of that too or
talk<00:02:04.640> about<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.970> as<00:02:05.119> well<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:06.380> if<00:02:06.500> you'd
