00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.250
 n8 htc name does not even go entirely 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.670
 but we have a port of sense 7 on roma skai 3 with just exit 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.810
 in the last few hours I show them all the news of this now 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.940
 implementation of the without 7. 0 meanwhile look at this screen 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.749

 uniforms for work casarano Sum we have the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 the classic new interface of the without 7. 0 2 is indeed possible of 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.400
 split skin folders various categories folders to come 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.729

 the source on the clock is not that we have a new possibility first of all vi 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.299
 I approach a little here, here it is 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.579
 as you can see now the notifications are divided with all the priorities 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.750
 and none 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.130
 a bit like we say on all android terminals 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.150
 look a little bit here we have the integration with 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 the new cisl soft keys 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.080
 how to smile when they go to form cribs I added the possibility of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.010
 pull down notifications with this is the key here how to do it 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.590
 very very simple it will be enough to enter the menu 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 settings 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.659
 settings menu that 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.579
 in the meantime you can see how it does not change compared to the without you though 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.580
 within customizations 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.259
 here we can meanwhile choose the new themes 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.670
 customizable themes as well as a photo 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.000
 the theme will adapt to labor dominance of color within our photo 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 we also have the ability to change navigation buttons 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.770
 never use navigation buttons can be changed up to 4 buttons 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.240
 as you can see I have added notifications 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.960
 no one forbids us to raise notifications by inserting a cave in these buildings 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.319
 quick as well as hd go to rearrange them via ip 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.459
 keys here 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.069
 on the right we wait for a little while back or we press as fine as we can 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.939
 see here we have the theme 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.030
 home default htc theme which as I told you can be changed 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.719
 can be changed 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.879
 or even created by us here we have 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.469
 a splendid integration is a splendid relationship with our themes 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.239
 also considering the possibility of creating new ones 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.489
 not that I also think there will also be the possibility of going there, here they are 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.500
 install inside the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.420
 in the various applications of bari claudio d htc as you can see 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.839
 there are so many I imagine then 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:59.599
 will be implemented also in the future and with the clear arrival of ours 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.059
 new m9 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.319
 multitasking ale and not change as you can see remains 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.309
 almost unchanged even with this version with this rome 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.720
 on clearly the keys 4 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.290
 you can go to add a screen or change your car from 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.189
 Grid card as it was in the past here in the Skype version snaps 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.999
 allen we also remove in the true look how our drue has been changed 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.500
 clearly angry at the possibility 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.210
 to have a slightly different view with this blue background I would also say a lot 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.739
 pleasant to the eye 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.550
 as you can see then there are apps because they are in the Rome skai dragona 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.999
 so don't worry 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.990
 calculator all defolt apps that don't change at all 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.669
 marty minando spa I open a message 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.139
 that changes the keyboard layout 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.840
 here it is you can't even see up close i've changed you 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.540
 completely 15 is much whiter within this new rome 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.970
 of home hdcd this sense 7 ep. 0 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.050
 to the camera clearly 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.499
 increases all the news that have been brought by htc 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.259
 on sense 7. 0 look 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.789
 nemo will do on white as you can see 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.860
 now change here we are totally changing the possibility of going to 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.020
 do measurable cases and in the menu and on the right here we have even the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.069
 possibility to calibrate there is our photo here in my world 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.520
 really lots of implementations 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.449
 especially when going for panoramic shots 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.110
 let's get add 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.780
 and here we clearly have all-round volley out and all the new function can 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 make a double sequence photo recording especially what it was 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.969
 and the symbol of m8 so all our implementation is what it is 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:55.860
 been up 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.889
 the feeling perfectly. 0 is also shown on the without seven. 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.300
 saranana improve 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.129
 nice things we have a new olympia finder 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.489
 or rather the unfaithful manual came even faster in my opinion 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:11.350
 upload all the contents 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.539
 perico this is a roma which is the first version then 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.650
 they are entirely bagasce 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.940
 certainly as you can see here in the main folder now covered 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.020
 some applications are included ah. inside the same book folder 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.819
 if it remains 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.210
 same if we see if some grid changes 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.550
 the grid size always remains the same we always have only stocklayout 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.920
 sum a something graphic that I think changes 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.340
 eeeh still makes you appreciate more look with a touch on the home there is the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.790
 possibility to change our entire screen with the possibility of 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.070
 edit theme add widget application or change 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.860
 our background also let them see the classic htc home backgrounds on 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.740
 sense 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.729
 seven. zero here we also have all the new backgrounds 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.970
 that is, but a lot of improvements for this software version u maronna that in 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.340
 first version so beware made a nice backup if you also want to go 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.729
 to install 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.710
 this version of this roma seems to me 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.760
 quite stable by the time we'll see in the next few days we'll see 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.830
 clearly, if 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.580
 other developers too 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.220
 they will move 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.260
 on ahahah this verolanuova platform without 7. 0 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.000
 the moment. dear girls as we always feel at the next video is a greeting 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.850
