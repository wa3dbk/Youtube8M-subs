00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
4034 and I don't have a lot of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
4034 and I don't have a lot of
experience<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.300> testing<00:00:51.840> under<00:00:51.960> harder

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
experience like testing under harder

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.090 
experience like testing under harder
extreme<00:00:53.219> conditions<00:00:53.960> but<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.949> know<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
extreme conditions but for you know my

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.400 
extreme conditions but for you know my
EDC<00:00:56.879> tasks<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.289> fine<00:00:58.590> um<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
EDC tasks it works just fine um the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.090 
EDC tasks it works just fine um the
blade<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:03.229> things<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.290> three<00:01:04.710> point<00:01:04.949> four

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
blade is things like three point four

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
blade is things like three point four
inches<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> safety<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
inches and it has a safety on it this is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
inches and it has a safety on it this is
a<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> spring<00:01:11.760> assisted<00:01:12.119> knife<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a this is a spring assisted knife but I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
a this is a spring assisted knife but I
never<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> safety<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> part<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
never really used the safety and part of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
never really used the safety and part of
the<00:01:15.600> reason<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.439> does<00:01:16.860> help<00:01:17.100> out

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the reason is because it does help out

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.109 
the reason is because it does help out
like<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.450> safety<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.900> but

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.620 

it's<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.240> definite<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.119> open<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it's not definite you still open and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.899 
it's not definite you still open and
close<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> blade<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> safety<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.720> and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
close the blade with the safety on and

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.490 
close the blade with the safety on and
it's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.150> knife<00:01:33.390> though<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> just

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it's a good knife though but I just

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120 
it's a good knife though but I just
never<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:34.979> used<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.920> you're

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
never really used that and if you're

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
never really used that and if you're
wondering<00:01:38.159> why<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.729> eye<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.570> doesn't<00:01:40.049> seem

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
wondering why my eye it doesn't seem

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230 
wondering why my eye it doesn't seem
very<00:01:40.229> spring<00:01:40.680> assistant<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.000> get

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
very spring assistant it's because I get

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
very spring assistant it's because I get
this<00:01:42.360> knife<00:01:42.570> completely<00:01:43.409> soaked<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.759> town

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this knife completely soaked one town

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
this knife completely soaked one town
because<00:01:45.329> some<00:01:45.750> idiots<00:01:46.170> pushed<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
because some idiots pushed me in a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.670 
because some idiots pushed me in a
freaking<00:01:47.040> pool<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> spring<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
freaking pool and so the spring on it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
freaking pool and so the spring on it
doesn't<00:01:50.040> work<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.369> well<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> takes<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
doesn't work as well and so it takes a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
doesn't work as well and so it takes a
little<00:01:52.079> longer<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> blade<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.100> out

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
little longer for the blade to get out

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.850 
little longer for the blade to get out
when<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> first<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> knife<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> would

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
when I first got the knife all I would

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.030 
when I first got the knife all I would
have<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.430> press<00:01:56.850> down<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.140> flipper

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
have to do is press down on the flipper

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.330 
have to do is press down on the flipper
and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> blade<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.880> completely<00:02:00.810> out

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
and the blade would be completely out

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
and the blade would be completely out
but<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.670> anymore<00:02:03.200> cause<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> couple

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
dollars I think which is a good deal in

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.430 
dollars I think which is a good deal in
my<00:04:57.250> opinion<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.849> think<00:04:57.879> it's<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.419> good<00:04:58.930> deal<00:04:59.169> but

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
my opinion I think it's a good deal but

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.939 
my opinion I think it's a good deal but
this<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.800> fairly<00:05:00.310> heavy<00:05:01.270> little<00:05:01.690> knife<00:05:01.949> cuz

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
this is a fairly heavy little knife cuz

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.980 
this is a fairly heavy little knife cuz
it's<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.340> heavy<00:05:03.550> duty<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.360> if<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.630> don't<00:05:04.810> like

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
it's so heavy duty so if you don't like

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.680 
it's so heavy duty so if you don't like
heavier<00:05:05.349> knives<00:05:05.650> then<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.400> wouldn't<00:05:07.270> get<00:05:07.389> I'm

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.950
