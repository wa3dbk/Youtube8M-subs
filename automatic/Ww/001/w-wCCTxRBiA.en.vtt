00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
nature and that type of thing and we

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.829 
nature and that type of thing and we
like<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.409> notion<00:00:36.769> that<00:00:36.850> development<00:00:37.850> here<00:00:38.210> is

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
like the notion that development here is

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.899 
like the notion that development here is
going<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.350> its<00:00:39.530> best<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.159> we<00:00:40.399> see<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.699> being

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
going to do its best and we see it being

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.090 
going to do its best and we see it being
done<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.780> not<00:00:41.930> need<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.680> know<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.800> heavy

and<00:00:46.190> having<00:00:46.489> walked<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.329> lot<00:00:47.540> that<00:00:47.570> we<00:00:47.930> put<00:00:48.199> at

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
and having walked the lot that we put at

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.350 
and having walked the lot that we put at
the<00:00:48.320> Parthenon<00:00:48.559> today<00:00:49.159> very<00:00:49.460> happy<00:00:49.970> but<00:00:50.180> what

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
the Parthenon today very happy but what

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.700 
the Parthenon today very happy but what
you<00:00:50.479> see<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:51.830> project<00:00:52.040> unlike<00:00:52.580> most<00:00:52.879> others

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
you see this project unlike most others

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.609 
you see this project unlike most others
the<00:00:54.710> environment<00:00:55.250> is<00:00:55.369> number<00:00:56.030> one<00:00:56.619> we're

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
the environment is number one we're

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.200 
the environment is number one we're
doing<00:00:57.799> a<00:00:57.860> lot<00:00:57.979> of<00:00:58.070> things<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.460> don't<00:00:58.879> want<00:00:59.119> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
doing a lot of things that don't want to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.570 
doing a lot of things that don't want to
get<00:00:59.390> done<00:00:59.629> with<00:00:59.659> the<00:01:00.170> typical<00:01:00.949> subdivision

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
get done with the typical subdivision

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.880 
get done with the typical subdivision
things<00:01:01.759> like<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.030> wetland<00:01:02.420> things<00:01:03.350> like<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
things like the wetland things like the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.210 
things like the wetland things like the
landscape<00:01:04.400> design<00:01:04.579> at<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.150> entryways<00:01:06.220> making

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
landscape design at the entryways making

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.460 
landscape design at the entryways making
sure<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:07.759> get<00:01:07.939> some<00:01:08.299> rain<00:01:08.630> gardens<00:01:09.200> and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
sure that we get some rain gardens and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.920 
sure that we get some rain gardens and
bio<00:01:09.650> soils<00:01:10.100> into<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.400> project<00:01:10.850> site<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.750> that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
bio soils into the project site so that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.740 
bio soils into the project site so that
we<00:01:12.049> capture<00:01:12.590> rainwater<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.509> allow<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:14.720> to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
we capture rainwater and allow it to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.840 
we capture rainwater and allow it to
infiltrate<00:01:15.350> back<00:01:15.799> into<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.250> site<00:01:16.460> that's<00:01:16.640> one

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
infiltrate back into the site that's one

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.280 
infiltrate back into the site that's one
of<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.000> key<00:01:17.210> things<00:01:17.420> about<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.750> development

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
of the key things about the development

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.359 
of the key things about the development
it's<00:01:18.439> very<00:01:18.619> different<00:01:18.890> from<00:01:19.159> other

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
it's very different from other

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.219 
it's very different from other
developments<00:01:19.970> with<00:01:20.299> conservation<00:01:20.810> design

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
developments with conservation design

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.830 
developments with conservation design
there's<00:01:21.620> several<00:01:22.550> aspects<00:01:23.120> that's<00:01:23.330> sort<00:01:23.810> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's several aspects that's sort of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.750 
there's several aspects that's sort of
living<00:01:24.080> with<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.650> environment<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.550> making

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
living with the environment and making

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.719 
living with the environment and making
use<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.380> best<00:01:27.560> way<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:27.830> can<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.070> making

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
use of it the best way we can and making

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.810 
use of it the best way we can and making
the<00:01:28.820> smallest<00:01:29.170> impact<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.580> we're

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the smallest impact on it and so we're

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.680 
the smallest impact on it and so we're
saving<00:01:32.560> 60%<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.920> land<00:01:33.950> 4ever<00:01:34.820> protected

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
saving 60% of the land 4ever protected

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.950 
saving 60% of the land 4ever protected
as<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.930> wildlife<00:01:36.710> reserve<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:38.659> we

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
as a wildlife reserve and then we

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.130 
as a wildlife reserve and then we
because<00:01:39.770> we've<00:01:39.979> got<00:01:40.190> 40%<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.180> land<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.930> put

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
because we've got 40% of the land to put

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.490 
because we've got 40% of the land to put
our<00:01:42.350> homes<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.190> our<00:01:43.310> infrastructure<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
our homes and our infrastructure in it

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.969 
our homes and our infrastructure in it
means<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.280> get<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.790> build<00:01:47.979> beautiful

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
means that we get to build beautiful

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.140 
means that we get to build beautiful
cohesive<00:01:49.540> villages<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.890> those<00:01:51.890> villages<00:01:52.520> are

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
cohesive villages and those villages are

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.690 
cohesive villages and those villages are
connected<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.890> nature<00:01:55.280> that's<00:01:55.460> around
