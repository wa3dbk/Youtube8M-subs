00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.519
 we are going to mount another type of decoy that goes very well with this 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.679
 technique 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.349
 we took out the salamander 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 salamanca 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.369
 we ride 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.279
 a curved hook 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.520
 as we said before we use two age types are the correct ones 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.489
 five robberies 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.399
 now let's change the rest method by one by one 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.589
 because we are going to use another vinyl 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.180
 which will be better 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.530
 this guy vans fire according 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.840
 we congratulate only remain 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.250
 and we passed 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.280
 to ride the curvón we will use the same place 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 in indifferent bikes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840
 for the two has forged dovecote 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 classic of all life 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 I was not in the mind 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.560
 leave the airport if your body 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.230
 we show 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 Montana 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.820
 we already have mounted launched madness 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.260
 with lead 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.170
 at a distance 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.010
 States parties 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 the field is ideal 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.790
 any vinyl 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.549
 that resigns even small fish complex madrid bathrobe 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 barbeito 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.420
 for example these maps houses 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 terrifying 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 both 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510
 It's a small fixed price 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.400
 then with the curved hook 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 it will go great 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.360
 ferrer superbly because 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.730
 next to jorge montava 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 linked it corroborates 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.730
 we have almost finished 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.920
 launched what I swear will be competitive 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.550
 10th with this extension that has 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.030
 the center of gravity of the Kurdish people 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.780
 exploded font observes hold this fish in a horizontal 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.090
 completely nature or for peace we return to forgive 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.830
 what exists 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 subtlety 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 and completely natural presentation 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.449
 and if he perceived 100 basis 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.649
 it would not be natural 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.049
 cpc cited 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.749
 and in it no way completely natural 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.129
 to which the article how are we going to take the issues of its kind 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.609
 massera the one that bobadilla 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.019
 to fool our friend centering he agreed 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.049
 all the games go great with any imitation of the psc these people 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.939
 he uses them indistinctly 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.449
 but I like to put each color 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.299
 subject and determines it 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.789
 both the curved 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.919
 super stupendous with the imitations 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.179
 of small fish more 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.059
 well let's ride another other pointed 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.390
 that also goes very well 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.069
 we imagine that we are already in the proposal 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.489
 the fish have put they have an incredible hunger 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.859
 finally dv 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.609

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.639
 for example 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.409
 the community 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.159
 well known to all of you 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.809
 a previous chapter 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.789
 per hundred already says that there are those of Lopez expensive 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.559
 it leaves us things like god 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.049
 purita is 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.539
 set jezbolá as look so tremendous 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:20.839

 for that time after the sunset according to peace 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.489
 all delegates 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.549
 Iran launched on himself 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.349
 as long as the vinyl is always natural 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.329
 while last year he played 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.139
 the current scheme 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.939
 look at this movement 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.939
 we already have the curvita in 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.049
 mounted 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.649
 the little lawn is not going to stay even two seconds when you see 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.529
 this deadly man 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.399
 he will think that he had breakfast of the day 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.649
 and without a doubt the battle 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.529
 finally decks 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.529
 special for after the sunset 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.519
