00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
you need to have that produce somewhere
in<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> usually<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.880> fridge<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> best

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
in it usually the fridge is not the best

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
in it usually the fridge is not the best
place<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.530> doesn't<00:00:34.770> ripen

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
place for because it doesn't ripen

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.069 
place for because it doesn't ripen
properly<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> sitting<00:00:36.780> out

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
properly so when you have it sitting out

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.830 
properly so when you have it sitting out
you<00:00:37.920> might<00:00:38.190> notice<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.940> swarms<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.600> fruit

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you might notice you get swarms of fruit

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
you might notice you get swarms of fruit
flies<00:00:39.989> moving<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.950> who<00:00:41.280> wants<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.850> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
flies moving in and who wants them right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.250 
flies moving in and who wants them right

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so if you are a dedicated vegan and do

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.430 
so if you are a dedicated vegan and do
not<00:00:46.440> believe<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.210> killing<00:00:48.210> flies<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
mosquitoes and such then this is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
mosquitoes and such then this is
probably<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> video<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.500> but

that caused the heart disease well fruit
flies<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> same<00:01:34.770> situation<00:01:34.950> you

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
flies are kind of the same situation you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
flies are kind of the same situation you
can<00:01:35.790> attack<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> symptom<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> attack

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
can attack the symptom or you can attack

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
can attack the symptom or you can attack
the<00:01:38.040> cause<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.180> attack<00:01:39.479> both<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the cause or you can attack both at the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.330 
the cause or you can attack both at the
same<00:01:40.680> time<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.920> what<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.040> actually

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
same time so what does that actually

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.929 
same time so what does that actually
mean<00:01:44.579> well<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.710> fruit<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.700> in

what<00:03:55.410> am<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.560> gonna<00:03:55.710> do<00:03:55.890> about<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:57.020> this<00:03:58.020> is

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
what am I gonna do about it well this is

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.980 
what am I gonna do about it well this is
pretty<00:03:58.350> much<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.580> out<00:03:59.730> Swift's<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.510> fruit

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
pretty much the out Swift's of fruit

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.900 
pretty much the out Swift's of fruit
flies<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.530> here<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:02.040> don't<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.580> how<00:04:02.730> well

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
flies right here I don't know how well

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.980 
flies right here I don't know how well
you<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:03.150> see<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:03.630> there's<00:04:03.870> probably<00:04:05.990> several

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
you can see but there's probably several

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.680 
you can see but there's probably several
hundred<00:04:07.290> fruit<00:04:08.130> flies<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.640> there<00:04:08.850> floating

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
hundred fruit flies in there floating

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.570 
hundred fruit flies in there floating
around<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.170> clump<00:04:12.020> so<00:04:13.020> this<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.250> very<00:04:14.459> much

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
around in clump so this is very much

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.870 
around in clump so this is very much
addressing<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:16.200> symptom<00:04:16.770> not<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.010> cause<00:04:17.459> but

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
addressing the symptom not the cause but

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.930 
addressing the symptom not the cause but
it<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.120> effective<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.930> what<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.979> do

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
it is effective and what you do

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.270 
it is effective and what you do
you<00:04:21.150> take<00:04:21.720> glass<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> fill<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.830> about<00:04:23.070> two

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you take glass and you fill it about two

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.390 
you take glass and you fill it about two
here<00:04:23.610> with<00:04:23.790> water<00:04:24.000> that's<00:04:24.540> what<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> did<00:04:25.400> about

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
here with water that's what I did about

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.030 
here with water that's what I did about
two<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.420> half<00:04:27.600> months<00:04:27.960> ago<00:04:28.020> maybe<00:04:28.350> maybe

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
two and a half months ago maybe maybe

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.570 
two and a half months ago maybe maybe
less<00:04:29.280> maybe<00:04:29.670> two<00:04:29.910> months<00:04:30.290> um<00:04:31.290> then<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.160> add<00:04:32.400> in

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
less maybe two months um then you add in

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.120 
less maybe two months um then you add in
one<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.540> one<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> half<00:04:33.920> tablespoons<00:04:34.920> of

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
one to one and a half tablespoons of

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.760 
one to one and a half tablespoons of
vinegar<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:36.540> tablespoon<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.350> sugar<00:04:37.560> and

vinegar and a tablespoon of sugar and
two<00:04:38.190> drops<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:39.380> juice<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.410> when<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.010> stir<00:04:41.310> it

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
two drops of juice so when you stir it

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.150 
two drops of juice so when you stir it
on<00:04:41.610> up<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.450> put<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.960> where<00:04:43.440> there<00:04:44.010> are

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
on up and you put it where there are

on up and you put it where there are
fruit<00:04:44.520> flies<00:04:44.790> now<00:04:46.010> this<00:04:47.010> will<00:04:47.220> not<00:04:47.400> get<00:04:47.580> rid<00:04:47.700> of

fruit fly situation by taking care of
what's<00:05:27.180> attracting<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.900> fruit<00:05:28.140> flies<00:05:28.700> so

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
what's attracting the fruit flies so

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.530 
what's attracting the fruit flies so
this<00:05:30.570> is<00:05:30.840> highly<00:05:31.080> effective<00:05:31.650> though<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.820> you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
this is highly effective though and you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.000 
this is highly effective though and you
can<00:05:33.690> leave<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:33.960> out<00:05:34.050> for<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.260> long<00:05:34.410> time<00:05:34.740> and

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
can leave it out for a long time and

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.220 
can leave it out for a long time and
unlike<00:05:35.310> beer<00:05:35.640> traps<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.360> doesn't<00:05:36.690> smell<00:05:37.110> it's
