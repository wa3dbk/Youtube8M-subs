00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
right and I form Pro also has the best

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
right and I form Pro also has the best
fullback<00:00:54.629> dive<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> game<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> reason

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
fullback dive in the game and the reason

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
fullback dive in the game and the reason
for<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> being<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:57.870> gets<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.230> boost

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
for that being is he gets a little boost

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.250 
for that being is he gets a little boost
and<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.789> top<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.809> notice<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and on top of that if you notice the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
and on top of that if you notice the
angle<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.829> he's<00:01:02.070> taking<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.969> top<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
angle that he's taking it's on top of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.140 
angle that he's taking it's on top of
the<00:01:03.719> offensive<00:01:04.170> guard<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> typically<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the offensive guard and typically in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.520 
the offensive guard and typically in
other<00:01:06.420> formations<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> be

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
other formations it's going to be

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
other formations it's going to be
between<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.040> center<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.340> offensive<00:01:08.790> guard

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
between the center and offensive guard

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
between the center and offensive guard
and<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.260> difference<00:01:10.770> makes<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and that little difference makes it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
and that little difference makes it
really<00:01:11.490> easy<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.939> cut<00:01:12.150> outside<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> can

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
really easy to cut outside as you can

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
really easy to cut outside as you can
see<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.830> Williams<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.250> only<00:01:14.430> about

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
see there and Williams is only about

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
see there and Williams is only about
eighty<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.119> speed<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> imagine<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> had<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
eighty one speed so imagine if you had a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.380 
eighty one speed so imagine if you had a
faster<00:01:16.860> guy<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.939> yeah<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.240> it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
faster guy there but yeah I mean it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
faster guy there but yeah I mean it's
it's<00:01:18.810> definitely<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> best<00:01:19.590> fullback<00:01:19.950> dive

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it's definitely the best fullback dive

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
it's definitely the best fullback dive
in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> game<00:01:21.060> hands<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.650> we're

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
in the game hands down and then we're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
in the game hands down and then we're
going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> twins<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.030> you'll<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:24.990> me
