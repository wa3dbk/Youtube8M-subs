00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.330
 Look guys here and sing me out for 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 another bang today not to top 7 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 movies that are made recommended to do 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 I think there's a month you know. 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 tuned time the channel so I'll do 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 today to start 97 seventh place goes 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 play I'm going to talk about a movie that is not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 that he is my favorite but always 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.579
 that he leaves and willingness to attend because 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 It's a subject I like in a subject. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 that I love but it 's a subject that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.449
 cares what it is about cars and those 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.149
 racing car stuff and also the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.120
 music style that touches the movie and the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.469
 actors then everything mixes I like the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 furious clock 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.250
 so whenever some harmful video comes out 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 Curious, I'm curious to watch. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.929
 but it was that movie that I want to go to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.719
 debut I always watch in 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.089
 sixth place and with a movie called put 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.150
 a friendship that came from the sea is not a 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.760
 movie film is an animation I think 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 Japanese anime style and talks about 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.230
 a little fish that is a girl is one thing 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 very complex, right? 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.960
 but it's a fish that saw the girl after 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 she looks like a human and her father is regal 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 that the sea is crazy not yet legal 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.450
 I really like the movies whenever I do 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 that she had 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.090
 I try to make people go and watch 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 This movie is cool so it will stay. 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.290
 in sixth place and fifth place will stay 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 A movie called June is a movie that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.660
 She was the one I like him, I think. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 that it is for the friendship he shows and for 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.070
 story itself where his brother 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 he does but I liked him 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.580
 I really liked it when I was younger 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.980
 school we were 15 years old he was mine 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.050
 film in fourth place and that the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.930
 Lord of the Rings The Lord 10 saga 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.780
 including the hobbit that I could 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.610
 put as a movie the most part since 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.890
 the rings 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.110
 The same story I put this as a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.660
 symbol the fourth favorite movie because 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 Why do you talk about things I like about 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 example the fantasy things of elf and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.880
 magician and all these things and I like 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.670
 much is a subject they would like to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.050
 fancy so he will stay in room 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.180
 place on this list 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.820
 in his place will be a son who is 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.650
 to this day I have organized it, which is the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.450
 I think the film is white. 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.340
 of yours in 2000 and something 2003/2006 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.530
 something like this and even today when 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.570
 I watch, I like this movie, I guess. 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.840
 grace you do not like this film look 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.090
 open those talks of two detectives not 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.340
 It's holy, many people they have. 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.620
 which protect the riches and beautiful river and 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.900
 ends up hurting her to be very 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.209
 patricinha they can not leave the house 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.489
 because it has scratches on so then 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.739
 they were with them in there is that 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.959
 I begins partially enjoyed the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.030
 movie so I highly recommend it 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.820
 second place will be another animation 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.030
 which is the movie paying wave that this fsap 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.239
 nóis is that Sanchez's father just a movie 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.980
 penguin and supa so you can notice it 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.459
 you want some penguin thing in the middle 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.190
 this whole story is the cadu in the translation 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.590
 Brazilian is the cable he is a surfer of 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.019
 a small island then a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.260
 I think he'll take him to a 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.110
 championship there he will send himself 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.930
 has that he has an example as 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.200
 surfer he knew until today 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.989
 and then there's a lot of surprise in the spirit 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.860
 never film where the demand is a 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.459
 animation and I recommend to finish 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.290
 first of all i leave the podium is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.989
 so from the first place with the fabulous 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.350
 fate of amélie poulan he is not a 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.360
 movie a lot of reaction and not action movie 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.340
 it is not a film your world ring 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.739
 are also football can not yet 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.049
 It's not a movie and it has a lot of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.650
 Such a thing , but it's a movie. 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.110
 many 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.060
 And I think this is what I liked 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.519
 a French film that shows the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.129
 simplicity of things to see 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.739
 This is really cool so I really liked it. 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.720
 this little movie is the way to be 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.060
 girl then if you can watch 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.160
 The film also watches is very 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.220
 It's very good, I think I know 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.560
