 is unique to percent the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 of course the wireless synchronization 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.590
 between the device and one 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.820
 Windows PC

 Percent which is very very very practical land 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.329

 I think it is 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.999
 except for this wireless synchronization between windows and 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.649
 May set 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.049
 percent 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.049

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.309

 now the covering is checked 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:25.209
 and there are only 128 MB here I do not think percent cool 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.279
 because if the marriage 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.519

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.019
 be yes 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.779

 Percent it has that way 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.509
 rather 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.779
