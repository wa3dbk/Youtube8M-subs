the<00:02:05.850> last<00:02:06.150> benefit<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:08.250> reduce<00:02:08.929> operating

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the last benefit is the reduce operating

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.000 
the last benefit is the reduce operating

costs linked to the other component like

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.860 
costs linked to the other component like
the<00:02:14.550> machine<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:14.970> more<00:02:15.180> controllable

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the machine is more controllable

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.110 
the machine is more controllable
you<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.890> retarding<00:02:17.340> capability<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you use the retarding capability of the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.500 
you use the retarding capability of the
engine<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.020> will<00:02:19.380> hit<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.610> brakes

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
engine so you will hit use the brakes

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.720 
engine so you will hit use the brakes
were<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.800> more<00:02:23.100> control<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
machine you will reduce the tire

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.150 
machine you will reduce the tire
slippage<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.910> increase<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> tire<00:02:27.750> life<00:02:28.160> the

slippage and increase the tire life the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.610 
slippage and increase the tire life the
machine<00:02:29.459> comes<00:02:29.700> also<00:02:29.910> with<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.660> new<00:02:30.900> oil<00:02:30.930> which

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
allowed double the maintenance interval

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.980 
allowed double the maintenance interval
again<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.130> reduce<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.820> past<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.480> last<00:02:36.840> but
