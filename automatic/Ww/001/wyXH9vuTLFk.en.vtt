00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.640
 the interventions of the Ministry of Public Health 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.410
 and the population 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.880
 it's one of those initiatives 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.950
 it was designed to disassemble it to give pregnant women 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.570

 and proceeds from an intelligent will of the debates to face certain 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.219

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.219
 which affects the national community 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.550
 unemployment figures 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.190
 with respect to reproductive health to challenge

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.190
 mother 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.720
 the vast majority of women who die during pregnancy or 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.200
 childbirth are among the poorest 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 and the most marginalized in society 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 so there is a situation to normal 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.450
 especially since eight situation is tense 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 Millennium Development Goal 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 which promotes universal access to health 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690
 reproductive 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.330
 all the more possible 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.579

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 giving life 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.699
 I'm waiting a little 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.059
 even if the husband yves boiret 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.079
 in Paris is totally at its greatest mix which weighs on our 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.539
 hearts and our consciences 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.979
 this program in the vth 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.069
 to bring the tournament level fairly comparable 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.259
 however 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:32.179
 6 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.319
 the responsible leader I am 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.499
 must preserve life 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.489
 as soon as it manifests itself 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.249
 the head of state does not have to lose sight of the growing population 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.389
 constitute these two major plagues of the modern world 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.089
 especially at the level of underdeveloped countries 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.759
 such as ours 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.469
 that's why 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.039
 I estimate 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.009
 that moment does he have healthy world 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.819

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
 it aims to empower sexual partners 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.749
 and to lead her to measure the obligations weighing in this plan what 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.649
 is buckled 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.009
 it only takes pregnancy 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.449
 the pregnancy be states suffered 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.769
 but that it presents itself the result of a reflected behavior 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.779
 who decided to assume the duties that flow from it 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.629
 I think I insist on this aspect of the question 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 how moirax and montserrat health and should be accompanied 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.049

 by bringing its beneficiaries to awareness 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.259
