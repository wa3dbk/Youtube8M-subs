00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
think but the English title which is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.280 
think but the English title which is
more<00:00:39.739> pronounced<00:00:40.070> for<00:00:40.520> me<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:40.910> football<00:00:41.629> so

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
more pronounced for me it's football so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.670 
more pronounced for me it's football so
we'll<00:00:42.920> go<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.280> title<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:45.230> ball<00:00:45.440> is

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
quite a lot of effort to get to 10

quite a lot of effort to get to 10
million<00:05:16.949> dollars<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:18.150> don't<00:05:18.840> think<00:05:18.900> she<00:05:19.259> had

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
million dollars I don't think she had

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.629 
million dollars I don't think she had
many<00:05:21.750> other<00:05:21.960> choices<00:05:22.259> that<00:05:22.740> make<00:05:22.800> this<00:05:23.129> movie

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
many other choices that make this movie

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.920 
many other choices that make this movie
within<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.539> 10<00:05:24.810> million<00:05:25.020> dollars<00:05:25.529> reach<00:05:26.930> but

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
within the 10 million dollars reach but

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.110 
within the 10 million dollars reach but
this<00:05:28.080> does<00:05:28.409> look<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:29.039> very<00:05:29.400> good<00:05:29.909> production
