 here we are going to cut a little bit 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.880
 so that we do not get too high 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.140

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.809
 they place it and they stick easily 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.500
 we hope we try to do it with all 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.740

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:02.699
 we can make little flowers and we are going to 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.699
