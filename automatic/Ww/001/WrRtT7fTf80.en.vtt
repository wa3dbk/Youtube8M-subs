00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.270
 today we'll take a look at it like two 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.400
 from our projects since then 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.020
 started spring he who goes to 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.879
 Calm down all of you 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.360
 maybe made about it 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.920
 to have 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.770
 you still remember ours 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.449
 Sowing machine about a month ago 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.060
 have a field with fodder beets 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.269
 sown they have now grown up 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 and now it looks like this unfortunately 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.430
 are also all sorts of other seeds 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.280
 but we have to work well 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.720
 with weed weeding ran 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.579
 we already suspect that the wild 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.579
 rabbits have served themselves 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.829
 while weÃ¤t we can the risen 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.020
 Thinning turnip immediately and have 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.760
 so much fresh salad green and know 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.920
 you still like us a piece of meadow with the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.420
 horses have plowed and the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.350
 potatoes directly under the stollen 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.440
 have planted 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.060
 that worked pretty well almost all of them 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.410
 have risen and we already have 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.410
 they started to pile up 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.659
 Now you see so soon after the plowing 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.340
 we do not have the field with the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.830
 corner worked and we had 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.990
 feared that the weeds and back 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.610
 Growing grass wants the potatoes 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.049
 but it does not overgrow that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.640
 have arrived have us one 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.210
 helped a bit with filming 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 Thank you very much 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.729
 The potatoes we have only with mist 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 fertilized but they are doing great soon 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.270
 the potato plants become too tall 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.189
 be to accumulate them even further 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.689
 can 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.670
 flora is now so far with her 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.979
 education that yourself with this 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.970
 for her new work easily clear 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.830
 comes so much to these two projects 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.539
 we will also try you over the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.659
 up to date with other projects 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.659
 hold 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.479
 if the day had more hours
