one<00:00:04.770> by<00:00:04.920> road<00:00:05.160> systems<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:06.029> something<00:00:06.359> that

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
one by road systems it's something that

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.480 
one by road systems it's something that
they<00:00:06.990> rolled<00:00:07.290> out<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.560> mountain<00:00:08.040> biking<00:00:08.340> quite

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
they rolled out on mountain biking quite

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.009 
they rolled out on mountain biking quite
a<00:00:08.550> few<00:00:08.700> seasons<00:00:09.030> ago<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.929> been

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
a few seasons ago and it's been

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
a few seasons ago and it's been
massively<00:00:10.469> successful<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.190> all<00:00:11.309> forms<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
massively successful in all forms of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.350 
massively successful in all forms of
mountain<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.330> racing<00:00:12.769> and<00:00:13.849> it<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.089> general

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
mountain but racing and it just general

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.240 
mountain but racing and it just general
matter<00:00:15.509> by<00:00:15.660> riding<00:00:15.839> then<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.440> 2014<00:00:17.039> they

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
matter by riding then in 2014 they

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
matter by riding then in 2014 they
brought<00:00:17.760> CX<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.480> which<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.410> by

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
brought CX one which is the one by

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.380 
brought CX one which is the one by
system<00:00:20.220> specifically<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.240> lacrosse

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
system specifically just like lacrosse

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.859 
system specifically just like lacrosse
and<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.650> 2015-2016<00:00:23.640> they're<00:00:24.570> rolling

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and now for 2015-2016 they're rolling

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.710 
and now for 2015-2016 they're rolling
out<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.080> system<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.590> used<00:00:25.980> across<00:00:26.720> many

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
out this system to be used across many

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.870 
out this system to be used across many
many<00:00:28.019> different<00:00:28.439> road<00:00:28.560> disciplines<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.519> Robin

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
many different road disciplines so Robin

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
many different road disciplines so Robin
here<00:00:30.150> has<00:00:30.240> been<00:00:30.380> riding<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.560> race<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.920> cxy<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
here has been riding and race in cxy for

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
here has been riding and race in cxy for
more<00:00:32.640> than<00:00:32.759> their<00:00:32.880> season<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
more than their season there and you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.090 
more than their season there and you
know<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.410> I've<00:00:34.469> been<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.680> experiences

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
know what I've been your experiences

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.170 
know what I've been your experiences
with<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> benefits<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with it and what the benefits of the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
with it and what the benefits of the
system<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.899> funny<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> way<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.710> muscle

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
system it's funny in a way that muscle

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
system it's funny in a way that muscle
addressing<00:00:38.790> cross<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> late<00:00:40.140> 80s<00:00:40.500> unable

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
addressing cross in the late 80s unable

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
addressing cross in the late 80s unable
and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.489> used<00:00:42.450> single<00:00:42.780> ring<00:00:42.930> setups<00:00:43.290> which

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and then used single ring setups which

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
and then used single ring setups which
was<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> north<00:00:44.820> since<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:45.930> we've

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
was kind of a north since then we've

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
was kind of a north since then we've
gone<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> double<00:00:46.800> rings<00:00:47.010> almost<00:00:47.280> universally

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
gone to double rings almost universally

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
gone to double rings almost universally
but<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> always<00:00:49.050> thought<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.860> several<00:00:50.250> seasons

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
but I always thought for several seasons

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.650 
but I always thought for several seasons
that<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:50.820> single<00:00:50.969> ring<00:00:51.149> might<00:00:51.360> suit<00:00:51.629> me

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that are single ring might suit me

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
that are single ring might suit me
better<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.379> CX<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.070> came<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
better and then CX one came around and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330 
better and then CX one came around and
it<00:00:54.180> seemed<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> ideal<00:00:54.629> solution<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.440> me

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it seemed like the ideal solution for me

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
it seemed like the ideal solution for me
the<00:00:56.610> cross<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> range<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.050> gearing

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the cross because the range of gearing

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
the cross because the range of gearing
for<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.980> majority<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.309> courses<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.760> when

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
for the majority of courses even when

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
for the majority of courses even when
they<00:01:00.090> are<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.480> hilly<00:01:00.980> isn't<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.129> wide<00:01:02.340> with

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they are very hilly isn't that wide with

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
they are very hilly isn't that wide with
the<00:01:03.379> technology<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> keeps<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> chain<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the technology that keeps the chain in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
the technology that keeps the chain in
place<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.630> having<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
place and not having to are about a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100 
place and not having to are about a
front<00:01:07.950> shifter<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.909> been<00:01:09.090> superb<00:01:09.479> all

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
front shifter it's been superb all

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.630 
front shifter it's been superb all
season<00:01:10.409> long<00:01:10.560> I've<00:01:10.740> met<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> single<00:01:11.310> problem

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
season long I've met a single problem

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.649 
season long I've met a single problem
with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> chain<00:01:12.000> coming<00:01:12.270> off<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.630> even

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
with the chain coming off or even

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.750 
with the chain coming off or even
getting<00:01:13.380> close<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.799> coming<00:01:13.979> off<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.549> never

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
getting close to coming off I've never

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.469 
getting close to coming off I've never
run<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:14.970> ideas<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> yeah<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.880> technology

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
run out ideas so yeah the technology

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
run out ideas so yeah the technology
they've<00:01:19.070> adapted<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> man<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.909> side<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
they've adapted from the man by side of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
they've adapted from the man by side of
things<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.540> refined<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.400> that's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
things and refined a little and that's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
things and refined a little and that's
basically<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> chain<00:01:24.630> ring<00:01:24.750> profile

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
basically this the chain ring profile

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
basically this the chain ring profile
and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:26.159> there's<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> clutch<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> rear

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and then there's a clutch on the rear

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
and then there's a clutch on the rear
met<00:01:27.150> yeah<00:01:27.689> yeah

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
met yeah yeah

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.520 
met yeah yeah
the<00:01:28.619> Xing<00:01:29.130> chain<00:01:29.430> ring<00:01:29.579> basically<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.530> what

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the Xing chain ring basically is a what

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
the Xing chain ring basically is a what
ceramic<00:01:31.829> cooling<00:01:32.100> wide<00:01:32.549> narrow<00:01:32.729> technology

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ceramic cooling wide narrow technology

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
ceramic cooling wide narrow technology
so<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.619> got<00:01:34.619> alternate<00:01:34.979> teeth<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.490> are

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
so you got alternate teeth which are

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
so you got alternate teeth which are
wider<00:01:35.880> than<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.299> are<00:01:36.329> were<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> between

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
wider than there are were and in between

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
wider than there are were and in between
there's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.340> ramp<00:01:38.759> section<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:39.659> has

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
there's a little ramp section which has

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's a little ramp section which has
if<00:01:40.079> any<00:01:40.409> mud<00:01:40.650> gets<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.159> chain<00:01:41.460> ring

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
if any mud gets on to the chain ring

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
if any mud gets on to the chain ring
from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> chain<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.990> presses<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
from the chain it just presses it out of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
from the chain it just presses it out of
the<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.369> doesn't<00:01:44.399> ever<00:01:44.759> build<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the way so it doesn't ever build up and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.950 
the way so it doesn't ever build up and
cause<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> chain<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> unship<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> chain

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
cause the chain to unship so the chain

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
cause the chain to unship so the chain
links<00:01:48.960> fit<00:01:49.229> perfectly<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.100> chain<00:01:50.310> ring

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
links fit perfectly over the chain ring

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
links fit perfectly over the chain ring
meaning<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> clutch<00:01:52.470> riemeck

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
meaning that with the clutch riemeck

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
meaning that with the clutch riemeck
which<00:01:53.670> prevents<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> chain<00:01:54.450> from<00:01:54.689> slapping

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
which prevents the chain from slapping

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
which prevents the chain from slapping
so<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:55.829> bumps<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
so when you're going over bumps and the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 
so when you're going over bumps and the
chain<00:01:56.909> usually<00:01:57.420> kicks<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> down

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
chain usually kicks up and down

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.999

it<00:01:59.460> isn't<00:01:59.670> able<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> found<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.009> massively

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it isn't able to so I found it massively

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.280 
it isn't able to so I found it massively
reliable<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> there's<00:02:03.450> obvious<00:02:03.810> opportunity

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
reliable and there's obvious opportunity

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
reliable and there's obvious opportunity
for<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> cross<00:02:05.130> over<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.479> now

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
for it to cross over as from have now

those another why do we need this there

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330

there's no rattle so you just kind of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
there's no rattle so you just kind of
you<00:03:14.040> run<00:03:14.160> along<00:03:14.250> again<00:03:14.459> my<00:03:14.760> publicist<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.569> is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
you run along again my publicist this is

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.420 
you run along again my publicist this is
ridiculous<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.860> type<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.190> thing

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
ridiculous and it's that type of a thing

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.349 
ridiculous and it's that type of a thing
when<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.609> get<00:03:17.730> back<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.060> look<00:03:18.180> at<00:03:18.269> your

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.879 
when you get back and you look at your
change<00:03:18.600> today<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.019> hasn't<00:03:19.380> got<00:03:19.530> paint<00:03:19.709> chips

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
change today and hasn't got paint chips

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.140 
change today and hasn't got paint chips
in<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.220> doesn't<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.489> splat<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.819> volume<00:03:21.030> on

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
in it and doesn't go splat the volume on

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.770 
in it and doesn't go splat the volume on
it<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.690> know<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.440> stage<00:03:22.709> smooth<00:03:23.069> it's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
it you know it's just stage smooth it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
it you know it's just stage smooth it's
it's<00:03:24.780> impressive<00:03:25.230> stuff<00:03:25.440> what<00:03:26.010> do<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.160> reckon

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
it's impressive stuff what do you reckon

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.610 
it's impressive stuff what do you reckon
on<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.850> there<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.750> now<00:03:27.930> been<00:03:28.109> rolled<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.560> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
on on there it now been rolled out on to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
on on there it now been rolled out on to
other<00:03:28.799> things<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.370> take<00:03:29.579> time<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.910> offer

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
other things you know take time to offer

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.910 
other things you know take time to offer
instant<00:03:30.359> I've<00:03:30.810> done<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> lot<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.230> time<00:03:31.709> toiling

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
instant I've done a lot of time toiling

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.949 
instant I've done a lot of time toiling
over<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.160> years<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.639> I<00:03:32.940> used<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.569> run<00:03:33.720> quite

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
over the years and I used to run quite

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.860 
over the years and I used to run quite
close<00:03:34.200> ratio<00:03:34.650> rings<00:03:35.340> anyway<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> 4853

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
close ratio rings anyway so like a 4853

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.650 
close ratio rings anyway so like a 4853
so<00:03:37.829> most<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.519> time<00:03:38.730> really<00:03:38.970> you'd<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.569> on

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
so most of the time really you'd be on

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.870 
so most of the time really you'd be on
the<00:03:39.690> big<00:03:39.870> ring<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.410> larger<00:03:40.709> end<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.980> chain

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the big ring in the larger end of chain

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.750 
the big ring in the larger end of chain
rings<00:03:42.090> above<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.870> original<00:03:43.200> 38<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.980> 46<00:03:44.519> range

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
rings above the original 38 to 46 range

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.539 
rings above the original 38 to 46 range
brought<00:03:45.510> out<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.900> CX<00:03:46.230> one<00:03:46.410> last<00:03:46.620> year<00:03:46.889> that

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
brought out for CX one last year that

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.089 
brought out for CX one last year that
now<00:03:47.669> extends<00:03:48.060> up<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.299> 54<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.079> two<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.620> two<00:03:49.769> jumps

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
now extends up to 54 in two to two jumps

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.400 
now extends up to 54 in two to two jumps
so<00:03:50.910> you've<00:03:51.030> got<00:03:51.209> an<00:03:51.299> option<00:03:51.540> with<00:03:51.630> say<00:03:51.720> 50<00:03:52.049> 52

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
so you've got an option with say 50 52

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.129 
so you've got an option with say 50 52
54<00:03:52.739> ring<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:54.060> any<00:03:54.180> cassette<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.599> choose<00:03:54.930> which

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
54 ring in any cassette you choose which

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.970 
54 ring in any cassette you choose which
could<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.349> from<00:03:55.500> 1125<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.650> 1042<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.859> you

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
could be from 1125 up to a 1042 of you

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.589 
could be from 1125 up to a 1042 of you
probably<00:03:59.340> wouldn't<00:03:59.639> wanna<00:03:59.760> use<00:03:59.880> out<00:04:00.060> for<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
probably wouldn't wanna use out for a

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.870 
probably wouldn't wanna use out for a
time<00:04:00.840> shot<00:04:01.079> but<00:04:01.319> there's<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.190> huge<00:04:02.609> amount<00:04:02.760> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
time shot but there's a huge amount of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.879 
time shot but there's a huge amount of
range<00:04:03.090> there<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.569> could<00:04:03.810> simplify<00:04:04.049> things

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
range there it could simplify things

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.860 
range there it could simplify things
enormously<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:06.510> don't<00:04:06.690> need<00:04:06.840> a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
enormously because you don't need a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.589 
enormously because you don't need a
front<00:04:07.049> shifter<00:04:07.470> there's<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:08.120> chance<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.450> might

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
front shifter there's a chance it might

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.089 
front shifter there's a chance it might
be<00:04:09.780> very<00:04:09.959> slightly<00:04:10.380> more<00:04:10.500> Aero<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:10.950> that's

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
be very slightly more Aero but that's

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.860 
be very slightly more Aero but that's
not<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.430> been<00:04:11.489> researched<00:04:11.940> yet<00:04:12.180> some<00:04:12.780> of

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
not really been researched yet some of

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.879 
not really been researched yet some of
the<00:04:12.930> guys<00:04:13.079> that<00:04:13.230> I've<00:04:13.349> been<00:04:13.440> talking<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.859> about

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
the guys that I've been talking to about

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.979 
the guys that I've been talking to about
it<00:04:14.160> are<00:04:14.849> getting<00:04:15.120> quite<00:04:15.359> excited<00:04:15.720> about<00:04:15.750> it

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
it are getting quite excited about it

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.810 
it are getting quite excited about it
are<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.289> more<00:04:16.530> kind<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.829> traditional<00:04:17.459> circuit

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
are you more kind of traditional circuit

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.270 
are you more kind of traditional circuit
or<00:04:17.940> or<00:04:18.299> quit<00:04:18.599> writers<00:04:18.900> who<00:04:19.530> are<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.190> know

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
or or quit writers who are you know

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.110 
or or quit writers who are you know
basically<00:04:20.519> well<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.789> never

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
basically well I never

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.300 
basically well I never
I<00:04:21.359> know<00:04:21.690> user<00:04:21.870> from<00:04:22.049> mark<00:04:22.260> anyway<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.770> having

I know user from mark anyway and having

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
that change security especially in that

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.150 
that change security especially in that
kind<00:04:25.830> of

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
kind of

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.950 
kind of
especially<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.670> crash<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.180> your<00:04:27.690> chain

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
especially a crash and your chain

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.810 
especially a crash and your chain
doesn't<00:04:28.350> come<00:04:28.470> off<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.580> give<00:04:29.730> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
doesn't come off it is going to give you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.610 
doesn't come off it is going to give you
a<00:04:29.850> significant<00:04:30.600> benefit<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.170> don't<00:04:31.500> think

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
a significant benefit I don't think

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.770 
a significant benefit I don't think
we're<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> see<00:04:32.130> one<00:04:33.120> by<00:04:33.240> systems<00:04:33.630> being

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
we're going to see one by systems being

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.650 
we're going to see one by systems being
used<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.170> in<00:04:34.380> Grand<00:04:34.920> Tours<00:04:35.160> or<00:04:35.520> or<00:04:35.910> major<00:04:36.180> races

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
used in in Grand Tours or or major races

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.410 
used in in Grand Tours or or major races
but<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.980> might<00:04:38.160> see<00:04:38.310> minute<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.700> top<00:04:38.880> yeah<00:04:39.210> a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
but you might see minute on top yeah a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.240 
but you might see minute on top yeah a
beauty<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.170> it's<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.740> niche<00:04:40.980> product

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
beauty of it is it's not a niche product

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.670 
beauty of it is it's not a niche product
but<00:04:41.520> it's<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.850> product<00:04:42.150> that's<00:04:42.270> quite<00:04:42.680> focused

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
but it's a product that's quite focused

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.880 
but it's a product that's quite focused
if<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:45.180> know<00:04:46.140> there's<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> writing<00:04:46.710> going<00:04:46.800> to

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
if you know there's a writing going to

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.520 
if you know there's a writing going to
be<00:04:46.950> doing<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:48.570> select<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.230> gears<00:04:49.470> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
be doing and you select the gears that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.280 
be doing and you select the gears that
will<00:04:50.010> suit<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:51.630> suit<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.990> sort<00:04:52.200> of

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
will suit you to suit that sort of

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.470

the back and beyond it could be great

really game alright we've got two sets
of<00:05:23.730> levers<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.630> have<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.810> use

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
of levers and you have to use

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.270 
of levers and you have to use
combinations<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.680> boat<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.040> be<00:05:26.100> able<00:05:26.220> to

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
combinations to the boat to be able to

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.100 
combinations to the boat to be able to
get<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> gear<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:26.760> actually<00:05:27.030> want<00:05:27.240> it's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
get the gear you actually want it's

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.660 
get the gear you actually want it's
quite<00:05:28.410> it's<00:05:28.830> quite<00:05:28.890> a<00:05:29.010> weird<00:05:29.220> thing<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.460> try

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
quite it's quite a weird thing to try

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.040 
quite it's quite a weird thing to try
and<00:05:29.700> understand<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.300> having<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.870> simple

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
and understand you having just a simple

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.480 
and understand you having just a simple
system<00:05:31.350> you<00:05:31.500> go<00:05:31.680> right<00:05:31.860> you've<00:05:32.010> got<00:05:32.130> one<00:05:32.280> lever

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
system you go right you've got one lever

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.100 
system you go right you've got one lever
that<00:05:32.820> one<00:05:32.970> up<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.480> makes<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.720> harder<00:05:33.960> that

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
that one up that makes it harder that

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.600 
that one up that makes it harder that
makes<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.350> easier<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:35.100> go<00:05:35.400> ahead<00:05:35.490> and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
makes it easier and you go ahead and

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.400 
makes it easier and you go ahead and
ride<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.450> maintenance<00:05:36.780> aspect<00:05:37.230> that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
ride and the maintenance aspect that

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.870 
ride and the maintenance aspect that
it's<00:05:37.950> going<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.220> take<00:05:38.400> some<00:05:38.550> either<00:05:38.760> it's

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
it's going to take some either it's

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.010 
it's going to take some either it's
going<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.060> be<00:05:39.150> quiet<00:05:39.360> -<00:05:39.540> it's<00:05:39.690> gonna<00:05:39.810> you're

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
going to be quiet - it's gonna you're

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
going to be quiet - it's gonna you're
not<00:05:40.110> going<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.290> worry<00:05:40.440> quite<00:05:40.590> as<00:05:40.710> much<00:05:40.860> about

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
not going to worry quite as much about

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.450 
not going to worry quite as much about
it

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.140 

because<00:05:45.460> there's<00:05:45.610> less<00:05:45.669> part<00:05:45.940> in<00:05:46.090> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
because there's less part in the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.760 
because there's less part in the
drivetrain<00:05:46.480> I<00:05:46.780> imagine<00:05:47.169> people<00:05:47.440> would<00:05:47.530> think

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
drivetrain I imagine people would think

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.710 
drivetrain I imagine people would think
that<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.310> you're<00:05:48.730> going<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.000> make<00:05:49.180> some<00:05:49.540> sort

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
that that you're going to make some sort

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.210 
that that you're going to make some sort
of<00:05:49.780> weight<00:05:49.900> saving<00:05:50.320> so<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.800> know<00:05:50.889> will<00:05:51.040> it<00:05:51.070> be

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
of weight saving so you know will it be

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.680 
of weight saving so you know will it be
a<00:05:51.250> group<00:05:51.460> set<00:05:51.669> look<00:05:51.820> that's<00:05:52.270> going<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:52.510> end<00:05:52.600> up

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
a group set look that's going to end up

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.780 
a group set look that's going to end up
with<00:05:52.900> all<00:05:53.290> your<00:05:53.440> weight<00:05:53.530> weenies<00:05:53.889> specking

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
with all your weight weenies specking

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.600 
with all your weight weenies specking
overall<00:05:55.510> it's<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:55.960> not<00:05:56.200> aimed<00:05:56.650> at<00:05:56.889> purely

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
overall it's it's not aimed at purely

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.090 
overall it's it's not aimed at purely
saving<00:05:57.910> weight<00:05:58.120> because<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.980> comparison<00:05:59.980> of

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
saving weight because a comparison of

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.900 
saving weight because a comparison of
strands<00:06:01.090> for<00:06:01.330> 22<00:06:02.080> row<00:06:02.230> group<00:06:02.440> set<00:06:02.820> compared<00:06:03.820> to

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
the force one group set you say the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.010 
the force one group set you say the
round<00:06:05.830> about<00:06:05.950> 50<00:06:06.190> grams<00:06:06.430> overall<00:06:07.060> for<00:06:07.960> the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
round about 50 grams overall for the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.450 
round about 50 grams overall for the
group's<00:06:08.230> that<00:06:08.380> weight<00:06:08.530> so<00:06:08.980> it's<00:06:09.100> not<00:06:09.250> about

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
group's that weight so it's not about

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.640 
group's that weight so it's not about
the<00:06:09.610> weight<00:06:09.760> saving<00:06:10.180> but<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.960> key<00:06:11.169> part<00:06:11.410> is

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
the weight saving but the key part is

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.950 
the weight saving but the key part is
because<00:06:12.370> you're<00:06:12.669> not<00:06:12.700> paying<00:06:13.000> for<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.630> front
