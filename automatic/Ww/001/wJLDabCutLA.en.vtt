00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 is 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.550
 one of the most important novelties in 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.610
 Haitian for 2014 is the birth of a 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.990
 new asylum the birth of macho 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.869
 this new style is the natural cycle 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.270
 360 ctr a boot that nate with the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.850
 same concept of your previous provides 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.199
 predecessor but that optimizes the boot 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.940
 with all the features that in 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.989
 Haitian has been incorporated during these 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.239
 last seasons you are 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.340
 technology the most technological boot of the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.410
 that until now was the hyper venom and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.930
 certain technologies of this boot has 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.589
 incorporated ctr360 becoming the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.589
 new macho 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.670
 the main technologies that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.100
 incorporates directly from the century 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.230
 hiper venom is a mesh that covers 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.880
 all the foot an elastic mesh on the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.130
 that the housing material sits 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.170
 the material the housing is kang alive and 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.330
 the internal mesh is the one that runs through 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.070
 our foot the second most influence 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.370
 important there but veil in this boot 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.380
 is the sole the sweat and predicted was not a 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.580
 sole with two plates of different 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.770
 density and especially that was 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.390
 forming formed by pepe bucks and nylon 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.580
 the fish bucks is a material that is going to 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.590
 provide reactivity and possibility of 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.810
 put flex points and the nylon is the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.670
 more perfect material with which to join the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 shell to the sole without forming 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 small fissures or small gaps 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 in addition to the mesh we 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 spoken directly from there but good 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.580
 the rest of the housing is a housing 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.860
 very similar to the ctr360 although in this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.510
 time has been removed foam 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.460
 resort and cover all the entire 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.080
 housing so the kanga light is the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.550
 material with which the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.440
 material that comes in contact with the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.660
 ball and that gives all the essence to 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.760
 this canga light boot is a material 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.020
 synthetic that what you want is to imitate 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.000
 all the properties of natural skin 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.920
 but eliminating the defects that it has 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.929
 this material is to say the excessive 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 water absorption or that the tedeshi boot 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 too much forming of small and 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.570
 annoying gaps we can see that in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.070
 all the area of â€‹â€‹the housing there is no 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.590
 Type of stitching only in the area 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.930
 of the heel presents the union of the two 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.130
 very important pieces also say that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.709
 like all high-end models 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.450
 presents the technology cc all 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.400
 condition control which is a treatment 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.020
 with which nike that waterproofs all 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.250
 the shell of the boot in such a way that 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.989
 Adverse weather conditions 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.250
 in no time they will affect 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.250
 during the practice of the game 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.340
 as for internal structure of magis 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.810
 neither should we say that both the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.460
 mesh that covers the foot like the kanga 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.050
 light are stable enough 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.380
 to provide the necessary stability 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.900
 to the boot only indicate that if 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.120
 we talked about the template we found 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.950
 an intermediate template is to say neither is 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.210
 as light and microperforated as that of 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.520
 the steam opening that what you are looking for 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.930
 is lightness or is it so padded with the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.370
 cell foam as is the model 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.900
 time that what you are looking for is maximum 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.220
 stability this would be a model 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.520
 intermediate that what you are looking for is 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.050
 the player bring a certain lightness and 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.800
 the time another feeling of stability 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.800
 when has put 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.390
 and perhaps the most important element and 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.290
 what is more different from the previous 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.910
 ctr360 is the sole here and to nike inherit 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.250
 all the technology that I had put in 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.140
 march in hyper venom and we met 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.600
 with two important characteristics 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.920
 one side the sole divided as in two 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.510
 sections in such a way that we're going to 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.130
 be always stable, let's load the foot 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.960
 over either of the two zones of the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.570
 boot and finally the studied 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.280
 combination of pemex and nylon te bucks 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.260
 as we said before is a material 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.120
 that forms the outer part of the sole 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.470
 that will allow you to play with different 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.300
 teachers and densities to create 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.910
 bending points and each time is a 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.140
 extremely reactive material by 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.790
 So much after each footstep we are going to 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.490
 quickly recover the position of 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.290
 foot the nylon is the one that is going to take care of 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.630
 the union between these plates that form 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.190
 the sole with the shell of the boot 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.630
 such a way that it's going to be a material that 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.400
 will give some elasticity a 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.140
 very resistant material and that will 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.100
 allow that with the different uses in 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.680
 no time are going to form 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.580
 clearances between the sole and the plate of the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.580
 Case
