00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 mini quicktipp today will be decided 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.850
 By the way, the market in front of the camera 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.020
 I keep saying that when you do 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.570
 there are and in front of the camera a bit 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.820
 see what i say i kinda like dr 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.019
 house so dr house anyway 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.460
 Such a funny cut of mag 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.080
 but he realized we wanted to go 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
 show how to do it right and have it 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.820
 so just in the short break 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 want to take a photo here in the photo studio 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.210
 have therefore also used one 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.670
 a compact flash still a Aufsteckblitz 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.530
 flash bracket I'll hold it up 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.270
 a reflector flashes with it 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.190
 gets very very big illumination 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.670
 because we have 24 mm zoom area here 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.170
 it covers about 10 to 10 o'clock 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.509
 rand here is a bit about the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.550
 The edge over here is in stock 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.560
 square meter exhibition area and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.110
 then get wonderfully wonderful 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.759
 beautiful portrait light for this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.650
 Covered here is the sparkling 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.659
 sun sound is very crisp 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.010
 ultra crisp but still has one 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.630
 small whale reinforcement and that's why 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.330
 the skin tone is so incredible 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.939
 interesting and that's why that too 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.189
 portrait much better than that of dr house 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.540
 and i would say a lot of fun with that 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.040
 results measure very simple setup 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.330
 just go over it 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.869
 maybe not five hours there would have 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.340
 let's see video filmer can suck 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.750
 slowly do not leave anymore 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.060
 I keep the camera steady 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.290
 shut up and say go after that is 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.259
 incredibly great portrait light as 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.770
 you look at the pictures of maxi us 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.770
 do it again a round
