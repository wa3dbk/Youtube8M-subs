pushed a little bit set at about 3/4 and
you'll<00:01:10.310> hear<00:01:10.670> how<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.240> amp<00:01:11.600> breaks<00:01:12.260> up

Swart<00:01:34.010> also<00:01:34.490> makes<00:01:34.729> an<00:01:35.030> atomic<00:01:35.600> boost<00:01:35.960> pedal

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
Swart also makes an atomic boost pedal

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.030 
Swart also makes an atomic boost pedal
to<00:01:37.640> complement<00:01:38.270> both<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.200> five<00:01:39.409> watt<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
to complement both the five watt and the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560 
to complement both the five watt and the
20<00:01:40.400> watt<00:01:40.549> amp<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:41.000> we're<00:01:41.119> playing<00:01:41.330> through

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
20 watt amp that we're playing through

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.420 
20 watt amp that we're playing through
now<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.650> gives<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.070> some<00:01:43.280> extra

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
now and it just gives you some extra

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.730 
now and it just gives you some extra
muscle<00:01:43.909> for<00:01:44.420> leap<00:01:44.720> tones<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.259> little<00:01:45.470> bit<00:01:45.590> more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
muscle for leap tones a little bit more

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.609 
muscle for leap tones a little bit more
sustain<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.630> we're<00:01:47.630> still<00:01:47.930> at<00:01:48.110> around<00:01:48.290> three

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
sustain and we're still at around three

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.499

quarters<00:01:48.890> on<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.280> amp<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.729> we've<00:01:50.390> been

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
quarters on the amp and we've been

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.499 
quarters on the amp and we've been
kicking<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.860> atomic<00:01:52.310> boost<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.880> we'll

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
kicking the the atomic boost and we'll

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:10.900 
kicking the the atomic boost and we'll
see<00:01:53.840> what<00:01:54.020> happens

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
input you have volume tone space which

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.880 
input you have volume tone space which
is<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:33.980> Swart<00:02:34.970> refers<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.350> reverb<00:02:36.680> as

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
is what Swart refers to the reverb as

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.460 
is what Swart refers to the reverb as
and<00:02:37.880> then<00:02:38.030> speed<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.600> depth<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.200> tremolo

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and then speed and depth for the tremolo

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.470 
and then speed and depth for the tremolo
there's<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.310> foot<00:02:40.550> switch<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.060> course<00:02:41.300> to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
control the trim and you have your power

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.070
