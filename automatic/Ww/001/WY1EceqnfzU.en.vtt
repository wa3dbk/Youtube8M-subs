00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
found a little bit well frankly off-put

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.160 
found a little bit well frankly off-put
is<00:00:58.309> when<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.339> was<00:00:59.550> ordering<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.170> windshield

combination<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> things<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
combination right one of the things that

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.020 
combination right one of the things that
I<00:01:03.930> frankly<00:01:04.470> didn't<00:01:04.769> realize<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
I frankly didn't realize you have to be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
I frankly didn't realize you have to be
very<00:01:06.270> careful<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.500> order<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.220> mounting

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
very careful to order the right mounting

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
very careful to order the right mounting
kit<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.380> windshield

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
kit with the right windshield

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.450 
kit with the right windshield
yep<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.500> tricky<00:01:13.530> sure

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
yep so that can be really tricky sure

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.889 
yep so that can be really tricky sure
and<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.210> things<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.659> bike

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
and that's because things are bike

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.020 
and that's because things are bike
specific<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.860> us<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.549> fitments

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
specific just like us are fitments

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
specific just like us are fitments
covers<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.570> many<00:01:18.690> different<00:01:19.200> popular<00:01:19.530> years

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
covers so many different popular years

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
covers so many different popular years
we<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.030> ensure<00:01:21.330> quality<00:01:21.509> fitment

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we have we ensure quality fitment

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.180 
we have we ensure quality fitment
because<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:22.530> saw<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> mount<00:01:23.009> kit

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
because we do saw the mount kit

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.889 
because we do saw the mount kit
separately<00:01:23.670> than<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.030> windshield<00:01:24.479> right

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
separately than the windshield right

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.050 
separately than the windshield right
because<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.500> bike<00:01:25.770> specific<00:01:26.009> yeah<00:01:26.670> but

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because they are bike specific yeah but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990 
because they are bike specific yeah but
you<00:01:27.179> guys<00:01:27.300> kind<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.750> simplified<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:29.000> with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you guys kind of simplified that with

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.820 
you guys kind of simplified that with
with<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> Switchblade<00:01:31.200> insource

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
with the Switchblade insource

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.770 
with the Switchblade insource
yeah<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.399> mean<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:33.179> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.330> windshields

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
yeah I mean the some of the windshields

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
yeah I mean the some of the windshields
fit<00:01:33.929> a<00:01:33.960> number<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> different<00:01:35.220> model<00:01:35.460> bikes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
fit a number of different model bikes

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
fit a number of different model bikes
but<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> mount<00:01:36.630> kits<00:01:36.840> also<00:01:37.470> fit<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.220> know

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but the mount kits also fit you know

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
but the mount kits also fit you know
different<00:01:38.700> model<00:01:38.909> bike<00:01:39.060> spending<00:01:39.569> on<00:01:39.690> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
different model bike spending on the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
different model bike spending on the
specifications<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> bike<00:01:41.220> yeah

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
specifications for the bike yeah

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
specifications for the bike yeah
and<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.020> another<00:01:43.259> thing<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
