 christian way of the kamelot dotcom 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 Today I'm going to talk about iso sensitivity and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.130
 What is this, after all, is the ability of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 our camera in observing a scene when 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 finish the brightness 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.990
 the greater the greater the use 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.609
 capacity of your camera 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 environments with low light 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.699
 and the smaller the iso the smaller the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 capacity 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.590
 this even today differentiates 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.880
 large cameras and great photographers 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 of the beginners or the most 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 limited to the capacity of a camera in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
 produce an image with natural light or 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.700
 a very dim light 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 is a differential but why do not we 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.129
 uses the same high for maresias 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.960
 occasions occasions good when 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.840
 we opted for a visual all happens to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 presence of noise in the image and what 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 that this conscious noise is a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.340
 determining the color or color dots 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.570
 especially when we approach image 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 this becomes evident 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.609
 I 'm here with my canon is a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.369
 compact a 2008 bed or two 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.280
 images with 80 that her and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.430
 another iso 1600 image will become evident 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 the presence of noise in the image 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.880
 Look, you notice that it points to the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 green and blue if we approach 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 of image 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.180
 another feature of the top is the grain 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 but in a certain way it becomes 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 turn a certain style into a certain texture 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 for the image 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.060
 if you commit color image that has 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.820
 noise and grain you to black and white 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.649
 you eliminate the noise that is present is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.619
 a feature of photography 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.700
 colored with that loud then the grain will turn 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.360
 a matter of style for some 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.860
 photographers 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.780
 It is important for you to try and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.149
 find out how much you like the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 until that until you accept 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 use for example photo 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.229
 commercial studio portfolio of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 sale is from images produced to 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.950
 non-advertising image bank 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.899
 accepted is in most cases not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.209
 accept this to be kept in is 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.360
 there are cases in which 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 they accept the smile 400 for example but 90 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 for every 90 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.190
 - if this without the ppi is required because 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.330
 you can control the power supply in the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 studio environment 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.319
 so that's the ability of your camera 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.019
 produced a photograph when 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.819
 the light is finished but within the 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.880
 we have the option of reducing this if 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.010
 It's an excuse to reduce the noise present and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 called noise reduction look at 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.550
 menu you the camera menu you will see 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.090
 I recommend that you leave the option 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.970
 normal because when we use the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 noise reduction the camera what it does 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.940
 she converts these points of noise she 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.980
 simulates the color for the colors that are 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.340
 close to noise often occurs 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.769
 that there is a loss of contrast to a loss 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.019
 a loss of sharpness of the 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.480
 image when there is a large application is 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.780
 the application of the noise reduction is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.819
 cool to use but not too much because that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.700
 can seriously compromise the quality and 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.250
 end result of your photo 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 an interesting aspect of the river there too 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.570
 when we use visual everything we go to 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.579
 a photograph and our camera one 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.370
 margin of options in terms of 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.530
 speed and openness but address these 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.180
 future issues in the next chapter 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.450
 Thank you so much, we have a next 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.450
 failure
