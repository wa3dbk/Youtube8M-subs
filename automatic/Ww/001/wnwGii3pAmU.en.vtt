compared<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:42.880> yy-you<00:01:43.880> don't<00:01:43.970> shoot<00:01:44.210> until

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
compared to the yy-you don't shoot until

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.060 
compared to the yy-you don't shoot until
you<00:01:44.479> hit<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.600> ground<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.620> just<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.040> little

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
through enough cancel the top it is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.469 
through enough cancel the top it is
possible<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.400> because<00:01:52.400> we<00:01:52.790> have<00:01:52.940> fast<00:01:53.210> hand

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
possible to do because we have fast hand

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.930 
possible to do because we have fast hand
and<00:01:53.690> we<00:01:53.780> can<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.100> now<00:01:55.250> here's<00:01:55.670> good
