00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.560
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.600
 to a new video this morning this afternoon 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.370
 when in the institute I published the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.050
 new video of the extinction game mode 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.780
 everything that is and everything that was known 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.009
 so far the filtered images 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.050
 speculations and so on so well 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.460
 the trailer came out I expected it to be 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.739
 Tuesday morning printed on all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.169
 trailers at about 7 6 in the afternoon 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.300
 I was hoping that I was bathed 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.529
 advance I have gone up this Monday like this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.210
 that as always we are going to do a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
 analysis we will analyze all 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.980
 important images and some some frame 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.630
 hidden that carries the trailer so 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.830
 nothing else we go there but first of all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 kids that I was forgetting 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.780
 I want you to open the image that I have just 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.880
 to leave in the description good in the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 image which 6 in link in the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.570
 description and it is for you to see the menu 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.990
 with the typical an uncle that already has 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.780
 the game 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.760
 on your twitter is publishing all the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.480
 images and a very curious one is this the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.980
 Ticos menu 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.170
 It is very important to tell you that in the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.270
 previous video I told you that the mode 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.440
 extinction was unlocked by completing the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.210
 campaign but you see that 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.400
 infinitive lunge update and 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.740
 Now, well, let's have what I 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.710
 that I believed it at first we're going to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 have squats and multiplayer campaign 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.980
 extinction that I think is the best 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 for 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.280
 in the menu for the way organization 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.230
 So there are more kids going there with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 the trailer well kids like always 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.160
 let's go analyzing fragment to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.230
 fragment and commenting what to me 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.520
 it seems more important in principle 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.110
 we see what appears to be the earth 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 totally destroyed and that has been 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 invaded by aliens with some 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 extraterrestrials we are going to put the image 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 right here in this that seems to be a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.320
 nest of aliens me this already commented 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.390
 in the previous video and is that looking at the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 trailer I usually think that it's me 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.620
 There remains a pretty clear idea of how 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.510
 will consist in that they will consist 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.730
 this game mode what will be your 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.170
 purpose how it will work and what it is 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.520
 what we have to do at a hundred 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 one hundred sure, but I think the base 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 yes we will know it through this 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.230
 trailer well this hive as I say it is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 a beehive of aliens this I know by the 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.680
 images that have leaked and going to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.950
 there are hives all over the map 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.900
 which are going to have to be drilled and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.420
 destroying the moment we place 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.610
 the drill that is the mechanism that we're going 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 to use to drill the hive 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.990
 destroy it will go the suns we go to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.130
 have to defend the drills with 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.260
 different 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.610
 objects and then we're going to have to go 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.230
 destroying the hives that there are by 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.600
 the whole map we're going to have a lot of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.460
 equipment and traps and this is going to be 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.470
 the mission protect the drill to be able 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.210
 destroy the hives well I have 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 summed up a general plan the trailer but 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.360
 Now let's go commenting on the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
 fragments to fragment as I say this is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.020
 a simple hive the nest of the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.000
 aliens and here we see the four 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.130
 soldiers that he says it can be four 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.720
 cooperative already preparing that as you 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.700
 I say is the drill that starts at 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.350
 pierce the hive there you see how 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.300
 begins to drill the and in the moment 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.280
 that we started to destroy it already appear 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 every alien is like there will be 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.050
 different types of aliens the most 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 powerful other specials and simply 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.860
 we with the equipment we have to 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.420
 defend the hive here you see a new 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.150
 four player game mode in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.010
 cooperative and such called extinction 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.360
 extinction miyagi you see the four 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.580
 soldiers around the hive 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.500
 turrets the drill and here you see how the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.290
 alien, they are going to throw themselves for the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.450
 Drills well here as this it goes well 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.400
 showing what we are going to have here 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.580
 as we see some binoculars that we are going to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.190
 have up gusts up missiles a sm and 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.470
 the aliens out there 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.180
 dying to protect the hive berries 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.460
 electrified and here you see how we have 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.130
 destroyed the hive it stops the trailer 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.050
 and we are going to see this this fragment because 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.630
 the truth seems to me something very interesting 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.100
 it is quite clear what is good 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.440
 let's see it in slow motion after 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.440
 that the hive is broken and we see an uncle 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.260
 running you see there how blinking with 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.880
 what looks like a turret looking 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
 down because it weighs a lot if 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.530
 we advance a few frames later we see 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.270
 to a titan here we see it good to a 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.770
 titan to a soldier is that to all the 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.190
 world that with a turret like that a suit 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.690
 so powerful I call it titan well it is 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.490
 the weapon that I think is equipped in 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.350
 the turret the friend is that added that 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.120
 it will cost money we will go giving money to 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.400
 as we go destroying hives and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.380
 we can not buy it and defend it from 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.480
 aliens well we advance in the trailer as 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.519
 we have that is quite powerful there we see 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.470
 the lights that come the aliens behind 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.990
 here he tells us that he is trespassing 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.360
 land we have to protect it this the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.770
 true that has given me the idea that goes 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.840
 to have different types of aliens 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.529
 because we've seen someone come 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.599
 the 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.669
 the points of the back of the body in 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.829
 general is yellow but this 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.809
 instead it has red and it comes out 

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.189
 from a different area than the others 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.409
 this gives me to think that there will be 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.839
 different types of aliens an alien boss 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.059
 I do not know but this good zombie this 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.319
 zombie not always with the idea of 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.509
 zombies but hey this someone has 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.309
 It seems to be more powerful than 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.979
 previous but good and kill him 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.749
 barrels traps fire a lot of 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.529
 ways to interact with the map things 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:03.809
 to manufacture to be able to defend ourselves and 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.089
 to be able to kill the aliens well here already 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.709
 You see how it is finally in the four 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:10.399
 soldiers running let's stop the 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:10.399
 picture right here 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.359
 and this has given me to think that perhaps 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.329
 this game mode 

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:23.519
 be for missions and have an end if 

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:25.529
 you remember the zombies because you rounds up 

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:27.149
 that in the end you're done with from here you see 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.739
 as the soldiers are running towards 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:30.689
 a helicopter to a point of 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:32.549
 encounter in which the other ico goes to 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.979
 collect and suppose that already after destroying 

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:37.930
 the beehives go to powers to be able 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.430
 get out alive and victorious from there 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.990
 then I do not know everyone who pulls their 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.850
 properties conclusions but it seems that 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.310
 the game mode can have an end 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.229
 with that last fragment here you have 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.660
 final themes with the cove with the 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.639
 face of the alien who is quite pretty and 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.740
 nothing more kids expectations 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.150
 I hope they make a lot of competition to the 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.850
 zombies make it a game mode 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.080
 Entertaining already said in the previous 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.669
 video to give me to upload 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.490
 enough videos and especially who you 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.930
 have to wait a lot of game I hope that 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.060
 do not be a failure as survival 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.100
 and nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.110
 full analysis of the trailer always 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.190
 leave me your suggestions in the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.720
 comments 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.860
 and nothing more kids a week for 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.860
 advisory goodbye
