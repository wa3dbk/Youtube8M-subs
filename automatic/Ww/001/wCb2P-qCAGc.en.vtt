00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.230
 the court by the name of pro talk and the gust of wind is from a cookbook with 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.329
 the title turkish vegetarian at the Real sum up to 10 euros 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.959
 a very nice book which already falls in the optical presentation 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.339
 the problem is that the normal ingredients 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.550
 nevertheless in the unusual combination if a guest one 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.929
 Taste revealed 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.259
 and is one of the cookbooks that is very beautiful in full-fledged 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.559
 Whole egg whites can be freely converted even though they were not thought of 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.300
 are Sibylle Scalzo so could continue to choose white but that can be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.580
 really easy to replace the recipes are very clearly described 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.940
 and there are still some small mistakes 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.930
 that's the amount of liquid you ever get the PREPARATION TIME Werner 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.240
 but this is 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 and on the whole, really nice to follow 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.380
 I have converted all this to a person's details in the cookbook 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.820
 for four persons 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.810
 that's just such a bar of leek about 250 grams a carrot about 70 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.730
 gram 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.660
 and then first 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.820
 I write something fresh tremendously so I do not shed the bowls 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 so much that I get about a teaspoon 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.910
 then a clove of garlic creeps up small that is not up in the basket 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 stated that was my ideas 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.659
 in the cookbook 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.280
 in front of something unusual remove the outer leaves and put in the ring 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 throw 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.090
 it's best to cut it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 before that gives off wooden rod in the piece where it is clean so I do not have that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.540
 completely done SC I have to open the here again and in the pond 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.540
 away 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 all 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.409
 I saved that one just did not look nice enough 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.849
 in the cookbook is the newly made that of course not 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 October 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:19.729
 and then he will continue to travel her prescribed in this recipe 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.729
 namely two tablespoons price for four people 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.729
 Of course, that's not really like Nel, he'll saturate his little one 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.310
 Beige because Brown Rice can not care in the specified time 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.699
 I made the recipe with millet 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.889
 now add 3 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.989
 as prescribed are 8 first early for the total amount 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.590
 but two tablespoons seemed to me too little 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.060
 I think that is a bit tailored to the German taste 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.089
 that he will take little oil 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.739
 now he does not see from the cookbook 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.349
 without stirring in a pot stir in Ingvar and then give sadly 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.349
 something else is about 10 minutes on low heat 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 Simmer 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.869
 I then asked for the garlic along with the team 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.949
 Waltraud Becker from Waltraud Becker had the city to let the whole cook 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:20.639
 CIF 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.919
 heated on a high flame that steam outlet and then on the smallest 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.930
 attitude 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.400
 the current 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 Cocott listed 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.139
 Now after these ten minutes she adds weight to some honey instead 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.159
 as prescribed 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.340
 salt pepper 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.849
 and then 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.830
 opposite to the cookbook, three tablespoons of water 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.780
 when I could not imagine that the millet tormented in the least 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.379
 If I did not give water as given before, price would not be 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:56.340
 complain 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.279
 I would even if I repeated again 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.559
 six testers missed out on eleventh to add 60 milliliters 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.110
 the authors tells her to season with salt and pepper and the dish very much 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.339
 simmer for about 20 minutes over medium heat 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.139
 I just started on medium heat 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.539
 but then, when steam was so strong under the lid, he was afraid 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.139
 I would have seared at the low skill amount I would have 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.870
 that again on the smallest flame 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.919
 As always, with other Beckhoff set back and that was also climate 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.839
 the total capital ratio and 30 minutes anyway I find something plentiful 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:39.839
 led vegetables 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.779
 then comes the juice of the lemon 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.139
 because that gives a great taste 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.490
 and the authors says lemon juice will develop finished cooled weight 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.809
 to give or to be separated 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.770
 I do not know if she expected it to be cold 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.360
 I thought it was deliciously warm 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 and also mixed with the lemon juice 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.229
 in front of the hotel is also a small explanation and also what you 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.229
 can still do it 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.139
 I have the court then too 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.860
 Copying with the rest area she lived in can really only be emulated 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.620
 I'm sure here's one or the other recipe that's good for you 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.620
 empathize 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.889
 As always, with 1 0 all those who want to move up now 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.379
 Enjoy your meal
