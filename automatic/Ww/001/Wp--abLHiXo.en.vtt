and Trunks but via the Patara earrings
this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.110> fusion<00:00:55.559> dance

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
this is not like the fusion dance

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
this is not like the fusion dance
apparently<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.930> tangs<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.039> use<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
apparently go tangs is going to use the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
apparently go tangs is going to use the
fusion<00:00:59.699> dance<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> third<00:01:00.510> episode<00:01:00.660> to

battle the Saiyans
but<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:02.940> assuming<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> be

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
but I'm assuming it's not going to be

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.920 
but I'm assuming it's not going to be
enough<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.760> know<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.540> keep<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
enough for them you know to keep on

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.109 
enough for them you know to keep on
going<00:01:07.350> towards<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> fight<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> next

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
going towards like to fight the next

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
going towards like to fight the next
villain<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> use<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
villain so they will have to use the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
villain so they will have to use the
Patara<00:01:11.760> earrings<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> question<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.350> what

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
true I'm pretty sure Troodon will not

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.360 
true I'm pretty sure Troodon will not
stand<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.810> chance<00:02:21.840> against<00:02:22.620> eggs<00:02:22.770> even<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
stand a chance against eggs even at the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.850 
stand a chance against eggs even at the
Super<00:02:23.670> Saiyan<00:02:23.850> 3<00:02:24.030> would<00:02:24.360> get<00:02:24.510> annihilated<00:02:24.900> he

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
Super Saiyan 3 would get annihilated he

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.309 
Super Saiyan 3 would get annihilated he
he<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.459> easily<00:02:26.819> get<00:02:27.240> obliterated<00:02:27.990> by<00:02:28.140> eggs

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
he would easily get obliterated by eggs

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.180 
he would easily get obliterated by eggs
in<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:28.650> opinion<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:31.290> go<00:02:31.860> tangs

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
in my opinion so I think that go tangs

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.760 
in my opinion so I think that go tangs
stands<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.390> chance<00:02:33.420> against<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> sands<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
stands a chance against the sands the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.330 
stands a chance against the sands the
evil<00:02:35.190> Saiyans<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.810> Troodon<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.680> would<00:02:38.100> say

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
evil Saiyans and as Troodon I would say

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.510 
evil Saiyans and as Troodon I would say
he<00:02:39.030> stands<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.569> chance<00:02:39.840> maybe<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.470> would<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.340> him

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
he stands a chance maybe I would go him

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.070 
he stands a chance maybe I would go him
as<00:02:41.610> far<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.970> legendary<00:02:42.330> Super<00:02:42.750> Saiyan<00:02:42.780> 3

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
as far as the legendary Super Saiyan 3

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.880 
as far as the legendary Super Saiyan 3

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.100 
Broly
but<00:02:44.520> that's<00:02:44.700> us<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.330> far<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.630> would<00:02:45.780> go

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
but that's us that's how far I would go

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.540 
but that's us that's how far I would go
him<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.380> don't<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.590> he's<00:02:47.160> able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:48.470> go<00:02:49.550> above

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
him I don't think he's able to go above

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.759 
him I don't think he's able to go above
levels<00:02:51.239> like<00:02:51.450> battle<00:02:51.930> legendary<00:02:52.440> super

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.040 
levels like battle legendary super
saiyan<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:53.280> brawling<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.209> think<00:02:54.450> he<00:02:54.870> can

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
saiyan for brawling I don't think he can

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.699 
saiyan for brawling I don't think he can
go<00:02:55.550> past<00:02:56.550> beyond<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.269> but<00:02:57.870> Vegeta<00:02:58.319> on<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
go past beyond that but Vegeta on the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.430 
go past beyond that but Vegeta on the
other<00:02:58.830> hand<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.550> do<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.810> he<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
other hand can do that because he is a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.590 
other hand can do that because he is a
fusion<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:02.010> Goku<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.580> Vegeta<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.269> most

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
Goten and Trunks and I didn't think that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.880 
Goten and Trunks and I didn't think that
was<00:03:32.700> going<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.000> happen<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.620> sure

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
was going to happen and I'm pretty sure

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.560 
was going to happen and I'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:35.040> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.370> pretty<00:03:35.700> awesome<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.360> see
