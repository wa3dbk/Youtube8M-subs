00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
maybe a little bit of a surprise at the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
bottom so let's go ahead and dim the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.399 
bottom so let's go ahead and dim the
lights<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> let's<00:00:59.610> fire<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> up

there it is the beginning at the end I
never<00:01:13.220> thought<00:01:13.490> they'd<00:01:13.700> get<00:01:13.850> distant
