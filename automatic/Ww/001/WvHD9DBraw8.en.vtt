tell you but I will tell you anyway I'm
probably<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.110> highway<00:02:25.620> overpass<00:02:25.950> right

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
probably do a highway overpass right

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.810 
probably do a highway overpass right
here<00:02:27.680> then<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.220> town<00:02:29.550> I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
here then going to make this a town I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 
here then going to make this a town I
might<00:02:30.180> leave<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.510> switch<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.200> put<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
might leave the switch in and put like a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.010 
might leave the switch in and put like a
little<00:02:31.650> Street<00:02:32.010> run<00:02:32.190> section<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.570> know

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
little Street run section in to know

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.740 
little Street run section in to know
where<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.950> ends<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.600> other

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
where this ends but if I get the other

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
where this ends but if I get the other
section<00:02:37.110> upright<00:02:37.350> continue<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
section upright continue it so you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
section upright continue it so you
actually<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> factory<00:02:39.930> or<00:02:39.990> something<00:02:40.050> else

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
actually put a factory or something else

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.280 
actually put a factory or something else
over<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> we'll<00:02:42.780> redo<00:02:43.050> all<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
over here but and we'll redo all the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740 
over here but and we'll redo all the
scenery<00:02:43.700> probably<00:02:44.700> try<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> redo<00:02:45.630> this

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
scenery probably try to redo this

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.210
