 It is one of the most beautiful monuments of the 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.890

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.790

 Widely recommended tapas and

 views of the Guadalquivir and where we 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.230
 proclaimed salmorejo ambassadors 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.099

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.090

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.209
 Y 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.170
 in Córdoba you can eat a lot and well 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.730
 and if there is an irreplaceable dish and 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.110
 representative is the us that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.769
 gazpacho 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.639
 fresh healthy and delicious we are going now like this 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.639
 with the recipe 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.490
 we have the previously washed tomatoes 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.110
 we take our hearts away with the help of a 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.479
 lace 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.910
 we cut in four pieces each tomato and 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.430
 we throw them into the bowl of the blender 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.230
 I use the thermomix but you can use 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.650
 an American glass or a blender 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.650
 arm 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.469
 We crush at full power for a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.310
 Minute the time will depend on your 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.350
 victor 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.600
 you can pass it by a Chinese to strain 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.130
 the nuggets if you want but the thermomix 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.150
 it leaves everything very crushed and makes me 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.730
 lack 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.470
 add the day - old bread 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.320
 Cordovan people use their bread 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.550
 but we do not have that bread so 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.550
 use the one that suits you 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.270
 salt and a garlic 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:19.120
 we add the oil and grind 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.949
 progressive speed from 5 to 10 or from 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.060
 medium to maximum until all the 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.550
 ingredients are well crushed 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.180
 I like espesito if you want more 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.370
 light 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.690
 it's a matter of adding less bread in 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.950
 this case I have made the traditional recipe 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.950
 of the brotherhood of salmorejo 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.110
 we give the special touch to salmorejo 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.770
 minced cooked egg and ham if it is 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.270
 Iberian 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.070
 much better 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.300
 a splash of virgin olive oil 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.300
 extra and ready 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.320
 Well, tell me what you think of me 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.870
 salmorejo are you at best 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.000
 as a Cordovan is effectively in 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.710
 I do not know if you know him but since 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.170
 then it's worth it in person it's more 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.910
 difficult because it is not in the whole world 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.710
 it is but it is worth it that you approach 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.060
 to see what he cooks especially his 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.620
 cakes are spectacular os 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.590
 I will leave the link by atiba that you can 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.340
 give him an ojito because nothing we are going to 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.340
 hit tomorrow we go until later
