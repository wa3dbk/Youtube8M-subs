when<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> show<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> screen<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.090> would

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
when you show it on the screen it would

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
when you show it on the screen it would
support<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.710> i<00:01:04.830> were<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> pause<00:01:05.519> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
support that so if i were to pause or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
support that so if i were to pause or
stop<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.240> movie<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.590> plug

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that unplug it and then plug it in would

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
that unplug it and then plug it in would

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
maps and blow that up for example or

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.080 
maps and blow that up for example or
