00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.540
 hello to all of you guys since I bow and 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.760
 I am built very short because I wanted to 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.650
 implement an idea of ​​another youtuber that 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.349
 was recommended to me by one of you 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.419
 registered lane that feels like it 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.850
 suggested and danilo thank him very much 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.800
 for this idea and the youtuber that 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.449
 let's say we had this idea I don't know if he has it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.650
 had he or anyone else based it on me 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.340
 anyway, however, the video I saw 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.790
 I to the right cocino which he makes a video 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.070
 a few minutes where you advise 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.050
 people to put in comments 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.550
 their data to play then everyone 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.440
 together and since it seems like an idea 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.120
 very pretty he wanted to implement it here too 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.550
 on my channel obviously on the world of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.739
 lol considering that the one of the section therefore 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.730
 very briefly you will see it now in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.309
 overlay 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.539
 all you have to do is put in 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 comments 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.680
 you believe your personal data is 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.930
 nickname of lol 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.020
 the division in which you are therefore can 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.830
 be bronze silver gold diamonds e 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.490
 what you want 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.410
 and what are you looking for if people with 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.009
 to which you simply play norm person 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.099
 on which to do much for two people per 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.720
 get away with team obviously so what I have 

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.729
 notice that they can be very useful 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.619
 that you can find both you and put 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.479
 data you are already witnessed 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.560
 want to add you can play 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.990
 all together 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.789
 it seemed very nice to me just because 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.399
 it can help you look for other people 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.679
 since I often get messages 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.569
 also on facebook where you ask me if I have 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.300
 friends you talk to play for 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.739
 then the lens and together well 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.720

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.069

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.899

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.720

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.530
 however you want 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.479

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.039
 division you are write your role 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.780
 preferred so as to help them more 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.489

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.140

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 chandler and so on then saying
