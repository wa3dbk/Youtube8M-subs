shuffling a little bit forward my back
foot<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:37.020> giving<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.400> propulsion<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
foot is giving me the propulsion this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.340 
foot is giving me the propulsion this
way<00:01:39.450> okay<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.350> basically

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
way okay and this is kind of basically

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
way okay and this is kind of basically
torquing<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.460> twisting<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
torquing or twisting a little bit in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
torquing or twisting a little bit in
this<00:01:45.840> era<00:01:46.049> okay<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.920> boom

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this era okay so it's like this boom

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.359 
this era okay so it's like this boom
boom<00:01:48.450> boom<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.680> generates<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.189> bit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
boom boom that generates a little bit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
boom boom that generates a little bit
more<00:01:50.520> power<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.149> than<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> real

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
more power than just than just a real

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.569 
more power than just than just a real
standard<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:54.229> mean<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.320> guess<00:01:55.500> maybe<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.399> could

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
standard I mean I guess maybe you could

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.899 
standard I mean I guess maybe you could
hurt<00:01:56.909> somebody<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.399> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
hurt somebody like this got it but you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.069 
hurt somebody like this got it but you
