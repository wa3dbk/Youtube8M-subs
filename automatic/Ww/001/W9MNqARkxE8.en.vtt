00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 was given 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.110
 What's up guys talking? 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.000
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.180
 today I bring it to you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.340
 marine play of a demigod playing black 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.130
 hole sun no playstation 3 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.470
 the guy is simply an absurd thing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 playing here hardcore mode 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.199
 understand hardcore and the guy takes 500 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.879
 thousand shots and practically did not die and a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.700
 another very interesting detail too 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.980
 that crazy guy he more or less knew 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 always where the opponent was looking 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
 he's going after the guy and he did not okay 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 looking like me op 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 he just did not kill the guy because 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.809
 kill him before he does so really 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.940
 this guy was very strange in 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 he died he was not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.829
 completely one of them let's say so he 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's say he 's a demigod for 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.550
 some things same pace had to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 take lots of shot for spanish led shot 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 too much 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 Look at grenade grenade in his faith . 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
 simply the guy does not die and a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 very curious detail is that hardcore and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.790
 hardcore for anyone who has played hardcore 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 for who plays and knows this modality 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.490
 practically you take two shots at the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 maximum 3 there 25 shots and the guy dies 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 It has virtually no time reaction 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.869
 none this guy who was taking shot 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.049
 to crooked and right he gave one of the pumas 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.420
 gated by the phase 11 apr acn a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.380
 capoeira and the guy managed to divert 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.110
 shots 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.329
 I managed to continue his is alive and he 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 knew where the opponents were 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.340
 finally it was a very strange situation 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 playing against this guy I would like to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 share with you there right? 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 This hack is happening on black. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 ops one these times I brought a hacker 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 of mortara article that was those 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.320
 those infinite bombs that stayed 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.470
 falling on the stage and I had spoken to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 You who had seen things a little 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.649
 different also in other matches b 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 that he thought very strange forever 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.990
 They knew that we were such, just not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.690
 had evidence only the registry destroyed the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.760
 barrel is explosive burst in his face 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.250
 simply does not die and one of the things 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.050
 more 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 absurd you will see at the end of 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.640
 video and how I was talking to you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.890
 I had seen something strange in the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 black ops one however i did not get to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.830
 to record I got to capture nothing to bring 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 for you guys 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.760
 and playing with my buddy yesterday is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.350
 what against this crazy 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 it was simply possible to see 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.150
 clearly that the guy was 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.100
 completely bugged right he is not imposing 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.250
 As I said, you could kill the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.590
 dude and a very interesting thing 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.450
 this was the only hard man to kill 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.120
 then theoretically he was 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.870
 with a strange thing do not know a few 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.520
 interesting things that is the following to the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.650
 sometimes it died easy 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.780
 for example practical half dyes the inter 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.730
 had an hour the guy did a tk on it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.989
 died super fast did not have any 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.239
 of difficulty 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.489
 so it 's kind of weird that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.190
 It was happening there I hope this 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.650
 not repeated and often in the field 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.660
 business is known as registrants 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.550
 of playstation 3 are hacked go 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.440
 post because so far there is little 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.230
 people using the hacker but for example the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.940
 module was 2 module was 3 fell in the river 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.340
 right before 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.040
 infested value was 2 is also super 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.810
 infested and it is very unpleasant to play a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
 online when you have people using 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.220
 That kind of cheating, I'll let you 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 this last stretch is simply a 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.080
 absurd you will see completely and 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.360
 that the guy is a professional demigod of 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.959
