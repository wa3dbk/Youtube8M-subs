and yeah so check it out alright so here
it<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.369> um<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.570> ended<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.500> getting<00:00:19.770> rid<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it is um I ended up getting rid of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210 
it is um I ended up getting rid of the
black<00:00:21.270> bars<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:22.020> right<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.039> just

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
black bars out right here and I just

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.779 
black bars out right here and I just
replaced<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.689> bad<00:00:25.050> boys

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
replaced them with these bad boys

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.330 
replaced them with these bad boys
because<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.050> metal<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:29.189> too

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
because the the metal was a little too

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.540 
because the the metal was a little too
thin<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.820> couldn't<00:00:30.179> weld<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.890> ya

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
thin and I couldn't weld it and so ya

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
thin and I couldn't weld it and so ya
changed<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.750> bet<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.469> pipe<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
changed it up a bit I bet some pipe that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.840 
changed it up a bit I bet some pipe that
I<00:00:34.980> found<00:00:35.690> outside<00:00:37.190> using<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.430> handy<00:00:38.820> dandy

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I found outside using my handy dandy

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:50.720 
I found outside using my handy dandy
pipe<00:00:39.780> bender

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.119 

so<00:00:51.730> yeah<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:52.030> was<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.149> lot<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.390> fun<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.040> be

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
so yeah that was a lot of fun but to be

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.910 
so yeah that was a lot of fun but to be
honest<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.460> think<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.760> turned<00:00:54.969> out<00:00:55.120> for<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
honest I think it turned out for the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.530 
honest I think it turned out for the
most<00:00:57.070> part<00:00:57.370> turned<00:00:57.610> out<00:00:57.730> pretty<00:00:57.910> good<00:00:58.210> there's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
most part turned out pretty good there's

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.209 
most part turned out pretty good there's
the<00:01:01.469> top<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.800> it

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
the top of it

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.010 
the top of it
the<00:01:03.640> only<00:01:03.850> issue<00:01:04.059> was<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:06.610> there<00:01:06.940> i<00:01:07.360> kinked

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
the only issue was right there i kinked

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.859 
the only issue was right there i kinked
it<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> little<00:01:08.470> bit<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:08.979> maybe<00:01:09.009> I'll<00:01:09.610> just<00:01:09.869> cut

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
it a little bit so maybe I'll just cut

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.300 
it a little bit so maybe I'll just cut
out<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.259> section<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> tube<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.220> then

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
out like a section of the tube and then

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.060 
out like a section of the tube and then
put<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.700> over<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.170> weld<00:01:14.409> it<00:01:14.530> on<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.860> make<00:01:14.950> it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
put it over and weld it on and make it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.039 
put it over and weld it on and make it
look<00:01:15.250> like<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.820> uh<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:17.800> didn't<00:01:18.190> kink<00:01:18.899> but<00:01:19.899> yeah

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
look like it uh it didn't kink but yeah

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.590 
look like it uh it didn't kink but yeah
I<00:01:20.080> think<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.409> looks<00:01:20.590> pretty<00:01:20.860> cool<00:01:21.330> gas<00:01:22.330> tank

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
I think it looks pretty cool gas tank

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.359 
I think it looks pretty cool gas tank
turned<00:01:22.869> out<00:01:22.990> quite<00:01:23.229> all<00:01:23.440> right<00:01:23.679> it's<00:01:24.220> gonna

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
turned out quite all right it's gonna

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.980 
turned out quite all right it's gonna
look<00:01:24.460> pretty<00:01:24.850> sweet<00:01:25.060> once<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:25.509> all<00:01:25.630> painted

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
look pretty sweet once it's all painted

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.400 
look pretty sweet once it's all painted
up

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
up

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.700 
up
so<00:01:27.100> one<00:01:27.310> drastic<00:01:27.970> change<00:01:28.300> that<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.690> made<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:29.500> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
so one drastic change that I made to the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.090 
so one drastic change that I made to the
design<00:01:29.860> was<00:01:30.780> getting<00:01:31.780> rid<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.080> this<00:01:32.320> thing<00:01:32.770> I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
design was getting rid of this thing I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.580 
design was getting rid of this thing I
was<00:01:33.850> kind<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.149> in<00:01:34.300> denial<00:01:34.659> about<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.409> thought

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
was kind of in denial about it I thought

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.690 
was kind of in denial about it I thought
it<00:01:35.770> would<00:01:35.860> work<00:01:35.890> great<00:01:36.539> but<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.950> end<00:01:39.100> it

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it would work great but in the end it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.389 
it would work great but in the end it
didn't<00:01:40.090> work<00:01:40.240> out<00:01:40.479> just<00:01:41.289> with<00:01:41.860> three<00:01:42.130> gears

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
didn't work out just with three gears

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.609 
didn't work out just with three gears
there's<00:01:42.610> way<00:01:42.819> too<00:01:42.880> much<00:01:43.149> friction<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
there's way too much friction on the

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.859 
there's way too much friction on the
engine<00:01:44.979> there's<00:01:45.550> also<00:01:45.729> not<00:01:46.000> enough<00:01:46.240> space<00:01:46.539> in

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
engine there's also not enough space in

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.130 
engine there's also not enough space in
between<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:49.119> properly<00:01:49.659> get<00:01:49.899> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
between here to just properly get the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.830 
between here to just properly get the
idler<00:01:51.130> pulleys<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.300> I'm<00:01:52.420> ditching<00:01:52.630> that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
idler pulleys in it so I'm ditching that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.160 
idler pulleys in it so I'm ditching that
idea<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.039> just<00:01:54.250> got<00:01:54.899> two<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> same

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
idea and I just got two of the same

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.229 
idea and I just got two of the same
sized<00:01:58.679> pulleys<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.979> I'm<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:00.940> going<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.119> do

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
sized pulleys and I'm just going to do

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.580 
sized pulleys and I'm just going to do
two<00:02:01.509> gears<00:02:01.899> instead<00:02:02.709> of<00:02:02.950> three<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.170> yeah<00:02:05.379> even

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
two gears instead of three so yeah even

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.160 
two gears instead of three so yeah even
with<00:02:05.920> even<00:02:06.910> with<00:02:07.060> two<00:02:07.360> pulleys<00:02:07.810> on<00:02:07.959> there

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
with even with two pulleys on there

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.449 
with even with two pulleys on there
there's<00:02:08.319> still<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> heck<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.129> lot<00:02:09.280> of

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
there's still a heck of a lot of

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
there's still a heck of a lot of
friction<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.560> whole<00:02:11.560> drag<00:02:11.830> system<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:12.610> I

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
friction on the whole drag system so I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.570 
friction on the whole drag system so I
had<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> find<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.330> way<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> make<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.430> that

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
had to find a way to make it so that

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.760 
had to find a way to make it so that
could<00:02:15.790> still<00:02:16.060> run<00:02:16.270> with<00:02:16.540> two<00:02:16.810> pulleys<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
could still run with two pulleys and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.240 
could still run with two pulleys and
idle<00:02:18.640> with<00:02:18.819> two<00:02:19.000> pulleys<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.260> made

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
idle with two pulleys on it so I made

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000 
idle with two pulleys on it so I made
this<00:02:21.459> little<00:02:21.849> thing<00:02:22.060> right<00:02:22.239> here<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.010> there's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
this little thing right here and there's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.770 
this little thing right here and there's
just<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.489> bracket<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.150> engine<00:02:25.629> back

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
just a little bracket on the engine back

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.010 
just a little bracket on the engine back
there<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.940> pulls<00:02:28.420> down<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.720> this

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
there and it just pulls down on this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.890 
there and it just pulls down on this
pulley<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.360> pushes<00:02:31.690> up

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
pulley so that it's it kind of pushes up

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.220 
pulley so that it's it kind of pushes up
off<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.340> drive<00:02:33.819> shaft<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.900> much<00:02:35.080> as

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
off of the drive shaft as much as

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.550 
off of the drive shaft as much as
possible<00:02:35.519> works<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.989> need<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> make<00:02:38.379> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
possible works I just need to make the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.100 
possible works I just need to make the
idler<00:02:39.010> pulley<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:40.000> pulls<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.660> on

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
idler pulley so that it pulls down on

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.869 
idler pulley so that it pulls down on
there<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.739> second<00:02:42.129> gear<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.550> know<00:02:42.670> as

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
there and we get second gear you know as

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.670 
there and we get second gear you know as
you<00:02:43.090> can<00:02:43.239> see<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.390> already<00:02:43.629> got<00:02:43.720> first<00:02:44.050> gear<00:02:44.379> put

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
you can see I already got first gear put

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.670 
you can see I already got first gear put
on<00:02:44.800> there<00:02:45.390> basically<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.110> stole<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.349> off

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
on there basically I just stole this off

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.240 
on there basically I just stole this off
of<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.010> chair<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.090> little<00:02:49.269> scroll<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
of a chair it's just a little scroll it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.620 
of a chair it's just a little scroll it
goes<00:02:51.459> down

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
goes down

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.150 
goes down
and<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.970> push<00:02:55.180> down<00:02:55.210> on<00:02:55.450> this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
and it's a you just push down on this

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.330 
and it's a you just push down on this
yeah

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
yeah

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.400 
yeah
the<00:02:57.910> old<00:02:58.090> pedal<00:02:58.420> there<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.170> should

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the old pedal there and it should

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.430 
the old pedal there and it should
tighten<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> belt<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:01.260> tested<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.350> out

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
tighten the belt I I tested it out

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.170 
tighten the belt I I tested it out
yesterday<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.430> first<00:03:03.700> gear<00:03:03.970> works

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
yesterday and the first gear works

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.510 
yesterday and the first gear works
really<00:03:04.420> well<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.960> didn't<00:03:05.920> try<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
really well I didn't try it with the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.760 
really well I didn't try it with the
other<00:03:06.550> pulley<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.210> there<00:03:07.450> though<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:07.960> we'll

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
other pulley on there though so we'll

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.280 
other pulley on there though so we'll
see<00:03:08.980> how<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.280> works<00:03:09.520> out<00:03:09.880> then<00:03:10.690> second<00:03:11.140> gear

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
see how that works out then second gear

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.780 
see how that works out then second gear
is<00:03:11.320> going<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> go<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> other<00:03:12.070> side<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.730> I'm

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
is going to go on the other side so I'm

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.890 
is going to go on the other side so I'm
just<00:03:12.910> going<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.090> flip<00:03:13.210> there's<00:03:13.510> gonna<00:03:13.660> put<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
just going to flip there's gonna put the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.150 
just going to flip there's gonna put the
other<00:03:14.050> pedal<00:03:14.760> right<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.120> thing<00:03:16.420> there

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
other pedal right on that thing there

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.290 
other pedal right on that thing there
yeah<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.340> thing<00:03:18.490> gets<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:18.940> goes<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
yeah this thing gets up and goes and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.140 
yeah this thing gets up and goes and
first<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.870> uh<00:03:20.370> let<00:03:21.370> me<00:03:21.430> show<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.970> really

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
first so uh let me show you that really

00:03:22.150 --> 00:04:29.440 
first so uh let me show you that really
quick

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.560 

so<00:04:30.080> there<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.440> have<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.860> was<00:04:30.980> um<00:04:31.570> that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
so there you have it that was um that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.780 
so there you have it that was um that
was<00:04:32.630> our<00:04:32.870> first<00:04:33.080> gear<00:04:33.410> test-drive<00:04:34.010> so

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
was our first gear test-drive so

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.310 
was our first gear test-drive so
unfortunately<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.390> bike<00:04:35.600> doesn't<00:04:35.990> want<00:04:36.230> to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
unfortunately the bike doesn't want to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.410 
unfortunately the bike doesn't want to
start<00:04:36.650> when<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> have<00:04:37.130> both<00:04:37.400> belts<00:04:37.940> on<00:04:38.090> there<00:04:38.240> so

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
start when I have both belts on there so

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.030 
start when I have both belts on there so
it's<00:04:38.540> still<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> little<00:04:39.110> bit<00:04:39.350> too<00:04:39.380> tight<00:04:39.800> you're

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
it's still a little bit too tight you're

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.950 
it's still a little bit too tight you're
just<00:04:40.190> thinking<00:04:40.400> what<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> should<00:04:41.090> do<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.780> don't

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
just thinking what I should do I don't

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.080 
just thinking what I should do I don't
know<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.530> guess<00:04:42.800> I'll<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:42.980> figure<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.490> out<00:04:43.610> so

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
know I guess I'll just figure it out so

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.310 
know I guess I'll just figure it out so
the<00:04:44.210> other<00:04:44.240> thing<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.630> have<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.750> work<00:04:44.960> on<00:04:45.170> is

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
the other thing I have to work on is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.740 
the other thing I have to work on is
this<00:04:45.500> thing<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:46.010> uh<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:47.000> has<00:04:47.180> way<00:04:47.420> too<00:04:47.450> much

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
this thing it's uh it has way too much

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.590 
this thing it's uh it has way too much
play<00:04:48.170> in<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.250> kind<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.460> slips<00:04:50.270> off<00:04:50.450> the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
play in it so it kind of slips off the

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.530 
play in it so it kind of slips off the
belt<00:04:50.810> every<00:04:51.050> once<00:04:51.230> in<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.410> while<00:04:51.700> like<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.970> and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
belt every once in a while like that and

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.860 
belt every once in a while like that and
then<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:55.300> also<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.600> find<00:04:56.990> make<00:04:57.830> away<00:04:58.100> so<00:04:58.160> it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
then I also have to find make away so it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.560 
then I also have to find make away so it
stops<00:04:59.870> before<00:05:00.230> this<00:05:01.130> thing<00:05:01.550> hits<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:02.270> thing

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
stops before this thing hits this thing

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.610 
stops before this thing hits this thing
and<00:05:02.960> then<00:05:03.950> maybe<00:05:04.640> make<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:04.940> spring-loaded<00:05:05.660> so

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
and then maybe make it spring-loaded so

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.530 
and then maybe make it spring-loaded so
yeah<00:05:06.860> that's<00:05:07.100> next<00:05:07.340> on<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.610> agenda<00:05:07.910> as<00:05:08.300> well

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
yeah that's next on the agenda as well

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.070 
yeah that's next on the agenda as well
as<00:05:08.840> setting<00:05:09.230> up<00:05:09.470> second<00:05:09.890> gear<00:05:10.780> maybe<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:11.900> should

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
as setting up second gear maybe I should

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.530 
as setting up second gear maybe I should
just<00:05:12.200> buy<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.550> bigger<00:05:13.550> belt<00:05:13.850> here<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.450> then

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
just buy a bigger belt here and then

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.600 
just buy a bigger belt here and then
maybe<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.810> bigger<00:05:15.050> belt<00:05:15.380> for<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.890> back<00:05:16.130> as<00:05:16.340> well

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
maybe a bigger belt for the back as well

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.730 
maybe a bigger belt for the back as well
I<00:05:17.740> don't<00:05:18.740> know<00:05:19.150> we'll<00:05:20.150> see<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:21.050> as<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.620> guys

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
I don't know we'll see and as you guys

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.650 
I don't know we'll see and as you guys
put<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:22.280> exhaust<00:05:22.880> on<00:05:23.180> there<00:05:23.360> just<00:05:23.540> like

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
put this exhaust on there just like

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.560 
put this exhaust on there just like
shoved<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.260> in<00:05:24.380> into<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.260> yeah<00:05:27.260> block<00:05:27.980> there

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
shoved it in into the yeah block there

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.000 
shoved it in into the yeah block there
but<00:05:29.570> that's<00:05:29.750> not<00:05:29.960> going<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.140> be<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.470> actual

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
but that's not going to be the actual

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.950 
but that's not going to be the actual
exhaust<00:05:32.770> just<00:05:33.770> temporary<00:05:34.540> I'm<00:05:35.540> really<00:05:35.840> eager

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
exhaust just temporary I'm really eager

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.860 
exhaust just temporary I'm really eager
to<00:05:36.110> see<00:05:36.380> how<00:05:36.500> well<00:05:36.740> shifts<00:05:37.250> gears<00:05:37.660> just<00:05:38.660> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
to see how well shifts gears just the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.410 
to see how well shifts gears just the
other<00:05:39.020> side<00:05:39.350> of<00:05:39.530> it

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.550 

so<00:05:44.420> yeah<00:05:44.540> hopefully<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.930> can<00:05:44.990> get<00:05:45.200> those<00:05:45.440> other

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
so yeah hopefully I can get those other

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.740 
so yeah hopefully I can get those other
belts<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:46.190> then<00:05:46.340> uh<00:05:46.370> maybe<00:05:47.210> that's<00:05:47.450> enough

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
belts and then uh maybe that's enough

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.530 
belts and then uh maybe that's enough
slack<00:05:48.110> that<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:49.220> gets<00:05:49.490> rid<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:49.880> most<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.420> the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
slack that it gets rid of most of the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.050 
slack that it gets rid of most of the
friction<00:05:51.080> but<00:05:51.500> all<00:05:51.710> we'll<00:05:51.980> see<00:05:52.220> doesn't<00:05:52.940> that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
friction but all we'll see doesn't that

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.670 
friction but all we'll see doesn't that
it<00:05:53.240> looks<00:05:53.390> really<00:05:53.720> cool<00:05:53.900> it<00:05:54.140> rides<00:05:54.380> really

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
it looks really cool it rides really

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.410 
it looks really cool it rides really
nice<00:05:54.920> as<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.280> saw<00:05:55.490> unfortunately<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:56.360> don't

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
nice as you saw unfortunately I don't

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.740 
nice as you saw unfortunately I don't
have<00:05:56.570> a<00:05:56.690> gas<00:05:57.080> cap<00:05:57.410> for<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.090> tank<00:05:59.090> yet<00:05:59.450> so<00:05:59.660> I'm

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
have a gas cap for this tank yet so I'm

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.620 
have a gas cap for this tank yet so I'm
just<00:06:00.010> kind<00:06:01.010> of<00:06:01.070> shoves<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.490> plastic<00:06:02.030> in<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.360> and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
just kind of shoves a plastic in it and

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.610 
just kind of shoves a plastic in it and
yeah<00:06:03.020> that's<00:06:03.470> for<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.800> gas<00:06:04.100> can<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:05.260> then<00:06:06.260> I<00:06:06.410> put

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
yeah that's for a gas can and then I put

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.880 
yeah that's for a gas can and then I put
the<00:06:06.740> seat<00:06:07.510> from<00:06:08.510> my<00:06:08.960> other<00:06:09.110> bike<00:06:09.380> on<00:06:09.650> there

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
the seat from my other bike on there

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.460 
the seat from my other bike on there
which<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.400> think<00:06:10.580> looks<00:06:10.790> pretty<00:06:11.060> sweet<00:06:11.470> so

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
which I think looks pretty sweet so

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.100 
which I think looks pretty sweet so
maybe<00:06:12.770> I'll<00:06:12.890> just<00:06:13.040> buy<00:06:13.190> another<00:06:13.220> one<00:06:13.580> and

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
maybe I'll just buy another one and

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.860 
maybe I'll just buy another one and
there's<00:06:15.110> how<00:06:15.230> I<00:06:15.290> attached<00:06:15.710> tank<00:06:16.220> um<00:06:16.730> I<00:06:17.150> still

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
there's how I attached tank um I still

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.560 
there's how I attached tank um I still
got<00:06:18.140> to<00:06:18.260> make<00:06:18.290> these<00:06:19.040> holes<00:06:19.430> there's<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.150> little

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
got to make these holes there's a little

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.750 
got to make these holes there's a little
hole<00:06:20.720> right<00:06:20.750> there<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:21.500> one<00:06:22.250> over<00:06:22.400> on<00:06:22.640> the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
hole right there and one over on the

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.180 
hole right there and one over on the
other<00:06:22.790> side<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.540> got<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.560> make<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.800> so<00:06:24.980> those

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
other side I got to make it so those

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.870 
other side I got to make it so those
screw<00:06:26.180> into<00:06:26.420> something<00:06:26.810> so<00:06:26.930> maybe<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.200> bracket

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
screw into something so maybe a bracket

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.580 
screw into something so maybe a bracket
coming<00:06:28.880> down<00:06:29.030> from<00:06:29.450> here<00:06:29.750> or<00:06:31.900> from<00:06:32.900> here<00:06:32.990> to

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
coming down from here or from here to

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.030 
coming down from here or from here to
here<00:06:34.480> then<00:06:35.480> I<00:06:35.540> just<00:06:35.690> welded<00:06:36.020> a<00:06:36.110> pipe<00:06:36.350> back

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
here then I just welded a pipe back

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.750 
here then I just welded a pipe back
there<00:06:37.490> and<00:06:38.710> drill<00:06:39.710> a<00:06:39.740> hole<00:06:40.010> right<00:06:40.040> through<00:06:40.280> it

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
there and drill a hole right through it

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.070 
there and drill a hole right through it
and<00:06:41.980> fed<00:06:42.980> some<00:06:43.280> sort<00:06:43.490> of<00:06:43.520> bolt<00:06:43.730> thing<00:06:44.080> through

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
and fed some sort of bolt thing through

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.710 
and fed some sort of bolt thing through
the<00:06:45.170> guest<00:06:45.700> and<00:06:46.700> that's<00:06:46.880> how<00:06:47.150> it's<00:06:47.330> mounted

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
the guest and that's how it's mounted

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.410 
the guest and that's how it's mounted
for<00:06:47.930> now<00:06:48.460> there<00:06:49.460> are<00:06:49.580> those<00:06:49.730> two<00:06:49.910> pulleys<00:06:50.210> that

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
for now there are those two pulleys that

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.240 
for now there are those two pulleys that
I<00:06:50.660> have<00:06:50.930> on<00:06:51.140> there<00:06:53.830> like<00:06:54.830> they're<00:06:55.040> both

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
I have on there like they're both

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.210 
I have on there like they're both
one-inch<00:06:55.760> or<00:06:56.180> something<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:57.080> one<00:06:57.710> 1/2<00:06:57.950> inch

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
one-inch or something and one 1/2 inch

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.640 
one-inch or something and one 1/2 inch
maybe<00:07:01.360> so<00:07:02.360> yeah<00:07:02.510> guys<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:02.840> guess<00:07:02.990> just<00:07:03.200> check<00:07:03.470> in

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
maybe so yeah guys I guess just check in

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.220 
maybe so yeah guys I guess just check in
with<00:07:03.680> me<00:07:03.830> in<00:07:04.190> part<00:07:04.430> 6<00:07:04.760> and<00:07:05.000> hopefully<00:07:05.840> I<00:07:05.870> have

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
with me in part 6 and hopefully I have

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.910 
with me in part 6 and hopefully I have
both<00:07:06.470> gear<00:07:06.830> setup<00:07:07.220> and<00:07:07.580> a<00:07:08.390> working<00:07:08.870> bike<00:07:09.260> all

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
both gear setup and a working bike all

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.670 
both gear setup and a working bike all
right<00:07:10.130> well<00:07:10.310> this<00:07:10.430> is<00:07:10.490> it<00:07:10.730> for<00:07:10.880> part<00:07:11.420> 5<00:07:11.780> I<00:07:12.170> hope
