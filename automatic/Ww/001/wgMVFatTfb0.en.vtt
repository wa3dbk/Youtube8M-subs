um so keep that in mind when I answer

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.189 
um so keep that in mind when I answer
this<00:00:14.910> question<00:00:14.969> I'll<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.570> try<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.109> an

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
this question I'll do try to do an

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.470 
this question I'll do try to do an
update<00:00:16.590> later<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.100> further<00:00:18.060> into<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
update later on further into the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.450 
update later on further into the
semester<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.800> difficulty<00:00:20.310> has

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
semester about if the difficulty has

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.870 
semester about if the difficulty has
changed<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:23.010> time<00:00:23.279> has<00:00:23.460> progressed

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
changed as I as like time has progressed

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
changed as I as like time has progressed
but<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.689> point<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.080> wouldn't<00:00:25.260> say<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
but at this point I wouldn't say that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
but at this point I wouldn't say that
any<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> concepts<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.699> been

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
any of the concepts have been

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.750 
any of the concepts have been
particularly<00:00:27.330> particularly<00:00:28.140> difficult<00:00:28.760> in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
particularly particularly difficult in

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.400 
particularly particularly difficult in
terms<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.840> been<00:00:30.990> learning<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
terms of what I have been learning in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.020 
terms of what I have been learning in
occupational<00:00:31.920> therapy<00:00:32.219> school<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> think

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
occupational therapy school now I think

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
occupational therapy school now I think
part<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.719> might<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.230> because<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
part of that might just be because of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.900 
part of that might just be because of
the<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.130> program<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> structured

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the way that my program is structured

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
the way that my program is structured
and<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.480> we're<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:37.079> getting<00:00:37.680> into<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and that we're not really getting into a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850 
and that we're not really getting into a
lot<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> interventions<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.559> in-depth<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
lot of the interventions or in-depth and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200 
lot of the interventions or in-depth and
we're<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.160> taking<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.670> anatomy<00:00:42.090> physiology

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we're not taking like anatomy physiology

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.200 
we're not taking like anatomy physiology
again<00:00:42.899> until<00:00:43.469> next<00:00:43.500> semester<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.969> amount

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
again until next semester this amount

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200 
again until next semester this amount
this<00:00:45.780> semester<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> mostly<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.399> basics

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this semester is mostly just the basics

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.930 
this semester is mostly just the basics
of<00:00:48.300> occupational<00:00:48.870> therapy<00:00:49.260> Theory<00:00:49.980> history

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of occupational therapy Theory history

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.330 
of occupational therapy Theory history
that<00:00:51.149> sort<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.960> part<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> reason

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that sort of thing so part of the reason

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
that sort of thing so part of the reason
it's<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.360> feel<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it's not I don't feel like it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's not I don't feel like it's
difficult<00:00:55.289> content-wise<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.250> probably<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
difficult content-wise is probably just

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080 
difficult content-wise is probably just
because<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.350> learning<00:00:58.649> um<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
because of what we are learning um and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.229 
because of what we are learning um and
then<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.109> might<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.670> just<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then also it might be just because of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
then also it might be just because of
having<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> experience<00:01:04.470> observing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
having the experience observing

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
having the experience observing
occupational<00:01:05.760> therapists<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> field

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
occupational therapists out in the field

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.109 
occupational therapists out in the field
um<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.060> easier

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
um that it might be a little bit easier

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
um that it might be a little bit easier
just<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.510> I've<00:01:09.990> witnessed<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
just because I've witnessed that and so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
just because I've witnessed that and so
have<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.210> classmates<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
have all my classmates because we had to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
have all my classmates because we had to
have<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.860> school<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
have that going into school so that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
have that going into school so that
might<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.210> part<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.720> why<00:01:15.930> occupational

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
might be part of why occupational

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.020 
might be part of why occupational
therapy<00:01:16.979> school<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.490> least<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.759> terms<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
therapy school at least in terms of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
therapy school at least in terms of
content<00:01:18.360> doesn't<00:01:18.509> seem<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> difficult<00:01:19.320> at

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
content doesn't seem that difficult at

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
content doesn't seem that difficult at
this<00:01:19.740> point<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> has<00:01:21.060> been

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
this point but one thing that has been

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
this point but one thing that has been
really<00:01:21.320> frustrating<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> frustrating

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
really frustrating or not frustrating

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
really frustrating or not frustrating
but<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.030> guess<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> difficult<00:01:24.869> aspect<00:01:25.229> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
but just I guess the difficult aspect of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
but just I guess the difficult aspect of
occupational<00:01:26.009> therapy<00:01:26.040> school<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:27.000> just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
occupational therapy school has just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
occupational therapy school has just
been<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> amount<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> takes<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
been the amount of time that it takes to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
been the amount of time that it takes to
complete<00:01:29.310> each<00:01:29.430> assignment<00:01:29.460> um<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.720> average<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
complete each assignment um on average I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
complete each assignment um on average I
would<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.400> point<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:33.030> having<00:01:33.479> two

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
would say at this point we're having two

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
would say at this point we're having two
to<00:01:34.170> three<00:01:34.549> assignments<00:01:35.549> due<00:01:35.820> each<00:01:36.060> week<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to three assignments due each week that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
to three assignments due each week that
we<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> turn<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.150> go

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we have to turn in and that will go

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
we have to turn in and that will go
towards<00:01:39.630> our<00:01:39.689> grade<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> those<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.670> for

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
towards our grade and those are just for

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630 
towards our grade and those are just for
some<00:01:42.150> reason<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:42.780> take<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.470> long<00:01:44.250> each

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
some reason they take so long each

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
some reason they take so long each
assignment<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.450> takes<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:45.899> insane<00:01:46.290> amount

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
assignment just takes an insane amount

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.120 
assignment just takes an insane amount
of<00:01:46.619> time<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:48.030> say<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.869> easier<00:01:49.320> ones<00:01:49.649> take

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of time I would say the easier ones take

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.639 
of time I would say the easier ones take
about<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.210> hours<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> take

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
about like two hours and they can take

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.819 
about like two hours and they can take
up<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.490> four<00:01:54.409> sometimes<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
up to like four sometimes I have you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
up to like four sometimes I have you
been<00:01:55.950> spent<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.430> many<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> six<00:01:57.329> hours<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
been spent as many as like six hours on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
been spent as many as like six hours on
a<00:01:57.899> single<00:01:58.170> assignment<00:01:58.530> um<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.610> not

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
a single assignment um and it's not

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
a single assignment um and it's not
we're<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.149> talking<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.659> big<00:02:01.049> project

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we're not talking like a big project

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.830 
we're not talking like a big project
that's<00:02:01.950> due<00:02:02.100> we're<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.149> talking<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that's due we're just talking about a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
that's due we're just talking about a
weekly<00:02:04.439> assignment<00:02:05.040> um

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
weekly assignment um

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.419 
weekly assignment um
now<00:02:06.210> keep<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.750> mind<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.140> definitely<00:02:07.890> work<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
now keep in mind I definitely work at a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
now keep in mind I definitely work at a
slower<00:02:08.729> pace<00:02:08.849> than<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.660> people<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
slower pace than some people and I

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
slower pace than some people and I
double-check<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.879> multiple<00:02:12.480> times

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
double-check what I do multiple times

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.270 
double-check what I do multiple times
and<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.830 
and so
definitely<00:02:13.700> slows<00:02:13.940> me<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.720> then

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
definitely slows me down and then

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.080 
definitely slows me down and then
sometimes<00:02:15.350> some<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> those<00:02:16.490> assignments<00:02:16.730> are

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
sometimes some of those assignments are

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.630 
sometimes some of those assignments are
group<00:02:17.330> assignments<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.230> does<00:02:18.620> seem<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
group assignments and that does seem to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.010 
group assignments and that does seem to
like<00:02:19.670> slow<00:02:20.120> down<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.450> process<00:02:20.660> because

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
like slow down the process because

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.660 
like slow down the process because
everybody<00:02:21.470> has<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.770> be<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.130> board<00:02:22.190> with

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
everybody has to be on board with

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.510 
everybody has to be on board with
everything<00:02:23.090> um<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> just<00:02:25.010> seems<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
everything um but it just seems like a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.699 
everything um but it just seems like a
really<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.480> long<00:02:26.750> time<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.380> really

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
really really long time for really

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.370 
really really long time for really
simple<00:02:27.890> assignment<00:02:28.610> um<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.300> I'm<00:02:29.989> not<00:02:30.020> 100%

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
simple assignment um and I'm not 100%

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380 
simple assignment um and I'm not 100%
sure<00:02:30.950> why<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.760> I'm<00:02:31.819> curious<00:02:32.090> if

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
sure why that is and I'm curious if

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.670 
sure why that is and I'm curious if
other<00:02:32.600> people<00:02:33.020> who<00:02:33.140> are<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.440> different

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
other people who are in different

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.500 
other people who are in different
occupational<00:02:34.459> therapy<00:02:34.819> programs<00:02:35.270> are

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
occupational therapy programs are

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.360 
occupational therapy programs are
finding<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.770> they're<00:02:36.950> having<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> same

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
not specific to my program or if this is

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.979 
not specific to my program or if this is
something<00:02:49.700> that's<00:02:50.150> consistent<00:02:50.660> across

something that's consistent across

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.320 
something that's consistent across

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
occupational therapy programs I hope
