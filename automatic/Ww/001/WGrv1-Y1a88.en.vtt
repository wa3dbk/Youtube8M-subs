down he is pylon and he is going to go
for<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> scout<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.829> PvP<00:00:44.460> usually<00:00:45.180> will<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
for a scout so PvP usually will see is a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.180 
for a scout so PvP usually will see is a
fast<00:00:46.730> robotic<00:00:47.730> facilities<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:50.039> know

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fast robotic facilities and you know

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.350 
fast robotic facilities and you know
these<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> transition<00:00:51.059> into<00:00:51.239> your

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
these are going to transition into your

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
these are going to transition into your
mortals<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.340> classes<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> sometimes

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
mortals or classes and sometimes

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.310 
mortals or classes and sometimes
actually<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.239> will<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.539> void<00:00:54.780> rays<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.110> well

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
actually we will see void rays as well

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
actually we will see void rays as well
and<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> early<00:00:56.879> voy<00:00:57.120> area<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and I think the early voy area is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.360 
and I think the early voy area is
actually<00:00:57.660> pretty<00:00:57.870> good<00:00:58.050> against<00:00:58.500> protoss<00:00:59.100> as

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
actually pretty good against protoss as

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
actually pretty good against protoss as
you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.270> charged<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you can get them charged up they can

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
you can get them charged up they can
take<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:01.890> stalker<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.489> pretty<00:01:02.699> fast<00:01:02.969> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
take down stalker it's pretty fast so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.440 
take down stalker it's pretty fast so
we'll<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.439> noni<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> Huck<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
getting the gas a bit earlier as well so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
getting the gas a bit earlier as well so
income<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> hug<00:01:43.140> easily<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.009> more

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
income was a hug easily with one more

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.109 
income was a hug easily with one more
problem<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> difference<00:01:44.939> between

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
problem that's the difference between

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.420 
problem that's the difference between
the<00:01:45.390> gateways<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.680> diner<00:01:46.860> timing<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the gateways and the diner timing here

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
the gateways and the diner timing here
as<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> cyber<00:01:48.630> girl<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.079> down

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
as we do have a cyber girl going down

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
as we do have a cyber girl going down
and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.399> we'll<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:50.790> nobody<00:01:51.030> does<00:01:51.180> after

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and so we'll see what nobody does after

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
and so we'll see what nobody does after
the<00:01:51.570> cyber<00:01:51.780> Corps<00:01:52.049> will<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> actually

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the cyber Corps will see the actually

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.060 
the cyber Corps will see the actually
going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.470> robotics<00:01:55.470> facility<00:01:55.590> or

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going to go for a robotics facility or

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
going to go for a robotics facility or
more<00:01:56.490> gateways<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.509> notice<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.170> he<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> only

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
more gateways but notice that he is only

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
more gateways but notice that he is only
11<00:01:58.979> gas<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.670> he<00:01:59.939> should<00:01:59.969> begin<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
11 gas right now he should begin the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.100 
11 gas right now he should begin the
second<00:02:00.750> gas<00:02:00.930> soon

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
second gas soon

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.140 
second gas soon
should<00:02:02.710> be<00:02:02.800> able<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.100> get<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.370> when<00:02:03.730> he's<00:02:04.000> got

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
should be able to get it when he's got

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.420 
should be able to get it when he's got
enough<00:02:04.360> money<00:02:04.510> actually<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:06.070> we'll<00:02:06.220> see<00:02:06.310> what

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
enough money actually so we'll see what

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.520 
enough money actually so we'll see what
he<00:02:06.520> does<00:02:06.550> here<00:02:06.700> as<00:02:07.060> Hawk<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.630> making<00:02:08.320> his<00:02:08.440> own

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
he does here as Hawk is making his own

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.660 
he does here as Hawk is making his own
cyber<00:02:08.830> Corps<00:02:09.100> as<00:02:09.250> well<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.210> we<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
cyber Corps as well and there we go so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.060 
cyber Corps as well and there we go so
no<00:02:13.150> knee<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.540> had<00:02:13.870> an<00:02:13.990> attack<00:02:14.260> at<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.710> moment

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
no knee is I had an attack at the moment

as he his topic was almost done where
hug<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:18.280> started<00:02:18.610> his<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.910> still<00:02:19.150> no

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
hug just started his and still no

sucking<00:02:19.720> gasps<00:02:19.900> I'm<00:02:20.560> not<00:02:20.770> too<00:02:20.860> sure<00:02:21.010> why<00:02:21.250> he's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
sucking gasps I'm not too sure why he's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
sucking gasps I'm not too sure why he's
knocking<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> second<00:02:22.330> guy<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.660> we'll<00:02:22.810> see

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
knocking the second guy so we'll see

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
knocking the second guy so we'll see
what<00:02:23.050> he<00:02:23.110> does<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.290> as<00:02:23.620> there<00:02:23.710> is<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.370> soccer

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
what he does here as there is one soccer

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.610 
what he does here as there is one soccer
coming<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.120> with<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> warp<00:02:26.080> gate<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> way

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
coming out with the warp gate on the way

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.250 
coming out with the warp gate on the way
for<00:02:26.680> Tyler<00:02:27.610> or<00:02:27.970> an<00:02:28.330> Oni<00:02:28.540> I'm<00:02:28.780> gonna<00:02:28.900> come<00:02:29.080> by

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
for Tyler or an Oni I'm gonna come by

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.840 
for Tyler or an Oni I'm gonna come by
whatever<00:02:29.680> name<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:29.980> comes<00:02:30.250> from<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.670> my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
whatever name that comes from to my

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.810 
whatever name that comes from to my
first<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:32.080> Huck<00:02:32.530> does<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.400> have<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> first

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
first so Huck does not have the first

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.810 
first so Huck does not have the first
gas<00:02:34.030> either<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.720> I'm<00:02:34.959> wondering<00:02:35.170> what<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
gas either so I'm wondering what the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.730 
gas either so I'm wondering what the
what<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.850> way<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.240> as<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.750> Huq<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.440> gonna

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
what the way it is as the Huq is gonna

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.880 
what the way it is as the Huq is gonna
back<00:02:38.920> off<00:02:38.950> his<00:02:39.220> probe<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:40.180> no<00:02:41.170> need<00:02:41.380> not<00:02:41.650> really

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
back off his probe so no need not really

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.410 
back off his probe so no need not really
doing<00:02:42.040> anything<00:02:42.340> at<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> moment<00:02:42.850> just<00:02:43.360> one

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
doing anything at the moment just one

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.620 
doing anything at the moment just one
gate<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:45.520> with<00:02:45.730> no<00:02:45.760> second<00:02:46.209> gasps<00:02:46.330> oh

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
gate and that with no second gasps oh

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.870 
gate and that with no second gasps oh
this<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.320> actually<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> weird<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.160> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this is actually kind of weird and this

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.650 
this is actually kind of weird and this
guy<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> plot<00:02:50.020> down<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.470> pylon<00:02:51.130> or

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
guy is going to plot down a pylon or

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.270 
guy is going to plot down a pylon or
he's<00:02:52.660> gonna<00:02:52.780> pull<00:02:53.020> up<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.680> pilot<00:02:53.950> down<00:02:54.070> all

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
he's gonna pull up on the pilot down all

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460 
he's gonna pull up on the pilot down all
the<00:02:54.430> way<00:02:54.550> over<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:55.020> perhaps<00:02:56.020> he's<00:02:56.200> trying<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the way over here perhaps he's trying to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.160 
the way over here perhaps he's trying to
hide<00:02:56.650> some<00:02:56.920> tech<00:02:57.310> or<00:02:57.520> something<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.930> anyway

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
hide some tech or something so anyway

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.050 
hide some tech or something so anyway
we'll<00:02:59.320> find<00:02:59.500> out<00:02:59.620> soon<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.459> there<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.850> go<00:03:00.940> the

we'll find out soon and there we go the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
we'll find out soon and there we go the
second<00:03:01.360> guys<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.780> down<00:03:01.959> for<00:03:02.320> no<00:03:02.620> knee<00:03:02.680> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
second guys going down for no knee and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.400 
second guys going down for no knee and
hug<00:03:03.880> actually<00:03:04.300> not<00:03:04.630> put<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.020> second<00:03:05.290> guys

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
hug actually not put in the second guys

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.560 
hug actually not put in the second guys
down<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.980> yet<00:03:06.100> he<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.790> making<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.150> slacker<00:03:07.360> of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
down just yet he is making a slacker of

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.910 
down just yet he is making a slacker of
his<00:03:07.720> own<00:03:07.900> warped<00:03:08.830> k<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.280> underway<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.940> well<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
his own warped k is underway as well so

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.280 
his own warped k is underway as well so
this<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.390> quite<00:03:13.390> IV<00:03:13.660> interest<00:03:13.989> interesting

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
this is quite IV interest interesting

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.800 
this is quite IV interest interesting
much<00:03:14.560> as<00:03:14.769> he<00:03:15.519> does<00:03:15.760> put<00:03:16.090> his<00:03:16.180> second<00:03:16.480> gas<00:03:16.600> down

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
much as he does put his second gas down

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.500 
much as he does put his second gas down
now<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.620> there<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.730> pallet<00:03:19.060> here<00:03:19.090> starting

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
now and there is a pallet here starting

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.180 
now and there is a pallet here starting
for<00:03:19.660> these<00:03:19.810> rocks<00:03:20.110> which<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.530> good<00:03:20.739> no<00:03:21.010> knees

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
for these rocks which is good no knees

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.580 
for these rocks which is good no knees
panel<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.610> finished<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.269> um<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.290> guy

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
panel is finished but this um this guy

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.259 
panel is finished but this um this guy
can't<00:03:23.950> really<00:03:24.100> spot<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.489> rock<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:24.910> he

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
can't really spot for the rock so he

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.240 
can't really spot for the rock so he
most<00:03:25.690> i<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.350> only<00:03:26.530> think<00:03:26.799> that<00:03:26.830> he's<00:03:27.010> trying

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
most i can only think that he's trying

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.820 
most i can only think that he's trying
to<00:03:27.340> hide<00:03:27.519> something<00:03:27.549> over<00:03:28.090> here<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:29.769> know

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
to hide something over here and you know

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.920 
to hide something over here and you know
i<00:03:29.920> don't<00:03:30.100> see<00:03:30.700> any<00:03:30.880> other<00:03:31.090> reason<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.660> putting

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
i don't see any other reason of putting

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.330 
i don't see any other reason of putting
the<00:03:32.019> pot<00:03:32.200> under<00:03:32.350> if<00:03:32.560> it's<00:03:32.709> not<00:03:32.799> gonna<00:03:32.890> spot<00:03:33.190> for

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
the pot under if it's not gonna spot for

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.970 
the pot under if it's not gonna spot for
the<00:03:33.430> rocks<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.630> we'll<00:03:35.170> see<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.380> that's<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:35.769> as

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
the rocks so we'll see we that's here as

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.280 
the rocks so we'll see we that's here as
cup<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.340> soccer<00:03:36.519> Alfred<00:03:37.480> nonino<00:03:37.780> well<00:03:37.959> excuse

cup of soccer Alfred nonino well excuse
me<00:03:38.489> as<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.790> burp<00:03:40.799> more<00:03:41.799> soccer<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.160> coming<00:03:42.370> out

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
me as I burp more soccer is coming out

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.630 
me as I burp more soccer is coming out
for<00:03:42.580> Nonie<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.840> perhaps<00:03:44.739> he's<00:03:45.190> going<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.549> go

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
for Nonie so perhaps he's going to go

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.430 
for Nonie so perhaps he's going to go
for<00:03:45.820> blink<00:03:46.360> stalkers<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:47.049> he<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.290> gonna

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
for blink stalkers actually he is gonna

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.080 
for blink stalkers actually he is gonna
get<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.739> twilight<00:03:48.220> cancel<00:03:48.519> this<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.730> actually

get a twilight cancel this is actually
really<00:03:49.120> weird<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:50.140> gauge<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.650> summer

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
really weird one gauge that this summer

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.440 
really weird one gauge that this summer
court<00:03:51.100> I'm<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.700> tonic<00:03:51.910> answer<00:03:52.269> right

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
court I'm going to tonic answer right

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.509 
court I'm going to tonic answer right
away<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.650> something<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.040> one<00:03:54.340> gay

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
away this is something to be one gay

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.130 
away this is something to be one gay
push<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> blink<00:03:55.480> stalkers<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.870> guess<00:03:56.019> he

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
push with a blink stalkers I guess he

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.199 
push with a blink stalkers I guess he
eventually<00:03:56.560> wants<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.700> think<00:03:57.940> Huck<00:03:58.060> is

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
eventually wants to but I think Huck is

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.550 
eventually wants to but I think Huck is
doing<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.540> same<00:03:58.690> thing<00:03:58.750> here<00:03:59.110> as<00:03:59.230> he<00:03:59.410> is

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
doing the same thing here as he is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.860 
doing the same thing here as he is
giving<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.860> second<00:04:00.190> gate<00:04:00.280> actually<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
giving a second gate actually and the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.229 
giving a second gate actually and the
third<00:04:02.110> gate<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.799> he<00:04:03.489> does<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.910> his<00:04:03.940> own

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
third gate and he does have his own

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.910 
third gate and he does have his own
toilet<00:04:04.630> council<00:04:04.930> committed<00:04:05.260> as<00:04:05.350> well<00:04:05.530> and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
toilet council committed as well and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.589 
toilet council committed as well and
this<00:04:06.250> was<00:04:06.989> plotted<00:04:07.989> out<00:04:08.140> before<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:09.730> dinner

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
this was plotted out before the dinner

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.410 
this was plotted out before the dinner

he is actually making a dark shrine so
he's<00:04:41.539> not<00:04:41.690> going<00:04:41.750> for<00:04:42.139> playing<00:04:42.440> he's<00:04:42.740> going

he's not going for playing he's going

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.810 
he's not going for playing he's going
for<00:04:43.340> dark<00:04:44.300> templars<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.740> where<00:04:46.160> did<00:04:46.370> he<00:04:46.610> hide

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
for dark templars so where did he hide

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
long time to build as this probe he is

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.930 
long time to build as this probe he is
going<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.620> put<00:04:54.770> down<00:04:54.889> another<00:04:55.130> pile<00:04:55.580> on<00:04:55.699> here

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
going to put down another pile on here

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.360 
going to put down another pile on here
as<00:04:56.259> these<00:04:57.259> sockets<00:04:57.590> are<00:04:57.770> going<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.099> take<00:04:58.220> that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
as these sockets are going to take that

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.770 
as these sockets are going to take that
down<00:04:58.520> pretty<00:04:58.699> fast<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.180> these<00:04:59.330> guys<00:04:59.539> are

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
down pretty fast and these guys are

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.900 
down pretty fast and these guys are
going<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.740> have<00:05:00.860> blank<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.310> pretty<00:05:01.490> soon<00:05:01.729> and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
going to have blank and pretty soon and

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.070 
going to have blank and pretty soon and
I<00:05:01.970> don't<00:05:02.270> know<00:05:02.360> that's<00:05:02.570> what<00:05:02.690> this<00:05:02.810> dark

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I don't know that's what this dark

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.420 
I don't know that's what this dark
shrine<00:05:03.349> it's<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.740> coming<00:05:04.009> time<00:05:04.160> or<00:05:04.340> not

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
shrine it's in the coming time or not

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.360 
shrine it's in the coming time or not
but<00:05:05.150> if<00:05:05.449> Hawk<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:06.320> able<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.800> get<00:05:06.979> dark

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
but if Hawk was able to get dark

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.790 
but if Hawk was able to get dark
templars<00:05:07.849> no<00:05:08.780> need<00:05:08.960> really<00:05:09.110> doesn't<00:05:09.500> have<00:05:09.590> any

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
templars no need really doesn't have any

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.439 
templars no need really doesn't have any
kind<00:05:09.919> of<00:05:10.009> detection<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.610> moment<00:05:10.910> because

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
kind of detection at the moment because

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.469 
kind of detection at the moment because
it<00:05:11.660> does<00:05:11.810> not<00:05:11.840> have<00:05:12.199> a<00:05:12.229> robotics<00:05:12.919> facility<00:05:13.479> so

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
it does not have a robotics facility so

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.790 
it does not have a robotics facility so
if<00:05:14.720> they<00:05:14.840> come<00:05:15.080> out<00:05:15.229> that<00:05:15.410> could<00:05:15.560> be<00:05:15.650> pretty

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
if they come out that could be pretty

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.700 
if they come out that could be pretty
dangerous<00:05:15.919> as<00:05:16.400> noni<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.630> skeletal<00:05:18.289> drugs<00:05:18.530> and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
dangerous as noni is skeletal drugs and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.020 
dangerous as noni is skeletal drugs and
he's<00:05:18.889> gonna<00:05:19.070> go<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.400> front<00:05:19.610> door<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.849> guess

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
he's gonna go to the front door I guess

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.850 
he's gonna go to the front door I guess
which<00:05:20.659> is<00:05:20.690> actually<00:05:20.930> pretty<00:05:21.199> unguarded<00:05:21.740> but

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
which is actually pretty unguarded but

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.260 
which is actually pretty unguarded but
doesn't<00:05:22.430> know<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:22.760> coming<00:05:23.060> because

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
doesn't know that's coming because

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.420 
doesn't know that's coming because
something<00:05:23.630> just<00:05:23.810> died<00:05:23.990> there<00:05:24.229> so<00:05:24.979> he's<00:05:25.190> dark

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
something just died there so he's dark

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.279

go<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.389> work<00:06:20.599> on<00:06:20.780> these<00:06:20.900> stalkers<00:06:21.199> and<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.919> think

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
go to work on these stalkers and I think

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.930 
go to work on these stalkers and I think
this<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:23.750> guy<00:06:23.979> this<00:06:24.979> guy<00:06:25.130> over<00:06:25.370> here<00:06:25.490> again

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
this this guy this guy over here again

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.750 
this this guy this guy over here again
nine<00:06:26.270> kills<00:06:26.630> already<00:06:26.960> so

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
nine kills already so

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.580 
nine kills already so
I<00:06:27.790> think<00:06:28.270> that's<00:06:28.450> going<00:06:28.570> to<00:06:28.630> be<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.780> pretty<00:06:29.380> much

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
I think that's going to be a pretty much

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.830 
I think that's going to be a pretty much
game<00:06:29.860> because<00:06:30.370> just<00:06:30.880> because<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:31.480> fact<00:06:31.750> that

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
game because just because the fact that

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.200 
game because just because the fact that
there<00:06:32.050> are<00:06:32.080> dark<00:06:32.350> templars<00:06:33.010> for<00:06:33.760> Hawkins

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
there are dark templars for Hawkins

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.320 
there are dark templars for Hawkins
there<00:06:34.630> is<00:06:34.720> no<00:06:34.840> detection<00:06:35.170> for<00:06:35.470> Tyler<00:06:36.160> I<00:06:36.850> mean

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
there is no detection for Tyler I mean

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.610 
there is no detection for Tyler I mean
these<00:06:37.780> guys<00:06:37.840> are<00:06:38.140> going<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.350> finish<00:06:38.470> the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
soccer stalkers are not going to do

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.400

you<00:07:34.750> actually<00:07:34.840> get<00:07:35.170> those<00:07:35.380> get<00:07:36.280> those<00:07:36.460> cannons

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
you actually get those get those cannons

you actually get those get those cannons
worked<00:07:37.390> in<00:07:37.510> he<00:07:37.660> could<00:07:37.810> actually<00:07:37.960> probably

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 
worked in he could actually probably

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.130 
worked in he could actually probably
turn<00:07:39.400> this<00:07:39.550> off<00:07:39.760> but<00:07:40.510> the<00:07:40.600> damage<00:07:40.960> has<00:07:41.110> already

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.140 
turn this off but the damage has already

turn this off but the damage has already
been<00:07:41.440> done<00:07:41.560> and<00:07:42.010> I<00:07:42.670> think<00:07:42.880> even<00:07:43.150> though<00:07:43.480> I

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.510
