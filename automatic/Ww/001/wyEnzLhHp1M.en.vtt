 won our all guys like that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.460
 this is the most interesting thing that can 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 be so Vlad say dreamed 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 have you ever thought about making you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.289

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.440
 Alexei voivode fight on hands 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.100
 honestly did not even think casually 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.649
 happened 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.960
 learned that here is carried out of 3 on her 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.789
 50 Alex happily all the way but broke 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.890
 athlete seriously like alexey yes 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.710
 so we called already and fast all all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.470
 for translation very angry very angry he 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.080
 became after skis so vlad able to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.080
 the threshold is gone now and so please 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:25.790
 that's not friendship 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.019
 that's why we won a friendship I 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.599
 guys here sometime this way 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.700
 alexey found in arm wrestling and then he 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.940
 It became a little after 3 months already 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.410
 international bobsled master 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.120
 so Vlad has great prospects 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 Now that's just all the same can leave 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.250
 your water, they are afraid to chase chase 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.280
 fights so normally tense vlad 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:55.100
 Alex certainly less stressed, too, but 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:58.100
 too spends the strength of a master class going on 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
 look 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:32.340
 actually vlad we have for 25 years 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.920
 You have a very good brush that's well and you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.160
 jump business and fixation is very weak 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.820
 that is, now just my little 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.500
 Master Class 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.360
 just do the weight that is, not at times but on 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.070
 retention pure retention toga statics 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.600
 so much static doesnâ€™t matter dynamics those 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 speaker you have knitting muscles 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.770
 good muscle sticky but stiffness coin 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.770
 will be stiffness 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.769
