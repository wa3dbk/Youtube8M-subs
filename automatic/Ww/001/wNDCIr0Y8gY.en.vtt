my friends YouTube he uses this to

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.129 
my friends YouTube he uses this to

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
record this tape running for him so you

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.369 
record this tape running for him so you
can<00:05:28.349> see<00:05:28.529> the<00:05:28.620> quality<00:05:28.830> there<00:05:29.250> it's<00:05:30.120> not<00:05:30.379> 1080p

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
that size but it's not exactly 1080p so

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.219 
that size but it's not exactly 1080p so
and<00:05:40.589> this<00:05:40.830> also<00:05:41.129> takes<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.729> 1.7<00:05:42.569> megapixel

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.309 
and this also takes a 1.7 megapixel
