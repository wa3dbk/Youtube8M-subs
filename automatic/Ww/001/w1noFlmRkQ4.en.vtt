today<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.410> setting<00:00:07.800> our<00:00:07.920> steel<00:00:08.189> beams<00:00:08.519> as

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
today we are setting our steel beams as

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.700 
today we are setting our steel beams as
you<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.269> see<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> crane<00:00:10.290> that's<00:00:10.470> all

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
you can see we have the crane that's all

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.640 
you can see we have the crane that's all
set<00:00:10.980> up<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.670> picking<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.240> columns<00:00:13.139> right

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
set up and it's picking up columns right

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.199 
set up and it's picking up columns right
now<00:00:13.889> they're<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> take<00:00:14.519> these<00:00:14.669> columns

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
now they're going to take these columns

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.510 
now they're going to take these columns
in<00:00:15.419> order<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.719> put<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.990> columns<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
in order to put the columns into the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.030 
in order to put the columns into the
basement<00:00:18.080> they're<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> strap<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.860> and

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
basement they're going to strap them and

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.740 
basement they're going to strap them and
they're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:20.760> them<00:00:21.150> when<00:00:21.360> we<00:00:21.480> set

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
they're going to use them when we set

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.180 
they're going to use them when we set
our<00:00:21.900> steel<00:00:22.170> beams<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> start

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
our steel beams are going to start

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.670 
our steel beams are going to start
setting<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.090> main<00:00:24.360> girders<00:00:24.780> first<00:00:25.140> which<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
setting the main girders first which is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.270 
setting the main girders first which is
goes<00:00:26.160> from<00:00:26.520> front<00:00:26.850> to<00:00:27.060> back<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.950> you<00:00:28.950> notice

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
goes from front to back as you notice

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.179 
goes from front to back as you notice
that<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.930> have<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> straps<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.950> on

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that they have the straps that are on

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.260 
that they have the straps that are on
them<00:00:32.309> now<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.180> lowering<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.130> then

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
them now the lowering them in and then

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.940 
them now the lowering them in and then
they're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> grab<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.020> beam<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.740> main

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
they're going to grab the beam the main

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
they're going to grab the beam the main
beam<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> set<00:00:38.580> already<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.330> have<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
beam is set already and now we have a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.590 
beam is set already and now we have a
crossmember<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> they're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.740> put<00:00:40.950> in

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
crossmember that they're going to put in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
crossmember that they're going to put in
in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.260> shop<00:00:43.560> they<00:00:44.329> weld<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:46.040> brackets<00:00:47.040> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
in the shop they weld on brackets that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.550 
in the shop they weld on brackets that
hold<00:00:47.550> these<00:00:47.790> cross<00:00:48.060> members<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.720> which<00:00:49.290> then

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
hold these cross members on which then

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.770 
hold these cross members on which then
they<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:49.890> bolt<00:00:50.220> right<00:00:51.060> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> main<00:00:51.570> beam

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
they will bolt right to the main beam

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.700 
they will bolt right to the main beam
itself<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.790> two<00:00:54.060> brackets<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:55.500> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
itself so you have two brackets one on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.010 
itself so you have two brackets one on
the<00:00:55.890> Beanery

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
the Beanery

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.479 
the Beanery
I'm<00:00:57.260> going<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.500> put<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.129> then<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
I'm going to put on and then in the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.030 
I'm going to put on and then in the
middle<00:00:58.790> of<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.059> other<00:00:59.210> beam<00:00:59.710> that's<00:01:00.710> where

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
middle of the other beam that's where

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.740 
middle of the other beam that's where
the<00:01:01.309> bearing<00:01:01.640> load<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:02.000> going<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.239> be<00:01:02.420> where

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
the bearing load is going to be where

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.180 
the bearing load is going to be where
they're<00:01:02.870> going<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.050> set<00:01:03.260> those<00:01:03.440> columns<00:01:03.920> you

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
they're going to set those columns you

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.550 
they're going to set those columns you
see<00:01:04.220> down<00:01:04.610> at<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.820> bottom<00:01:05.260> there<00:01:06.260> all<00:01:06.409> our

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
see down at the bottom there all our

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.620 
see down at the bottom there all our
footings<00:01:07.010> those<00:01:07.400> are<00:01:07.580> our<00:01:07.670> piers<00:01:08.060> which<00:01:08.330> all

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
footings those are our piers which all

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.649 
footings those are our piers which all
of<00:01:08.840> these<00:01:08.990> beams<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.790> columns<00:01:11.150> are<00:01:11.450> going<00:01:11.540> to

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
of these beams and columns are going to

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.520 
of these beams and columns are going to
be<00:01:11.720> set<00:01:12.049> those<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.830> our<00:01:12.950> load-bearing<00:01:13.580> points

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
be set those of our load-bearing points

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.370 
be set those of our load-bearing points
so<00:01:15.530> they<00:01:15.680> transfer<00:01:16.399> all<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.820> way<00:01:16.909> up<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
so they transfer all the way up to the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.560 
so they transfer all the way up to the
top<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.920> our<00:01:19.040> roof<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.240> called<00:01:20.479> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
top of our roof so it's called a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.210 
top of our roof so it's called a
load-bearing<00:01:20.810> wall<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.619> transfers<00:01:22.070> from

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
load-bearing wall that transfers from

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
load-bearing wall that transfers from
our<00:01:22.399> roof<00:01:22.610> all<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.180> way<00:01:23.240> down<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.229> floor

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
our roof all the way down to the floor

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.820 
our roof all the way down to the floor
just<00:01:24.860> like<00:01:24.979> shoes<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.780> all<00:01:26.960> your<00:01:27.259> load<00:01:27.470> when

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
right over the top of it so that if that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.150 
right over the top of it so that if that
wall<00:01:56.660> ever<00:01:56.900> moves<00:01:57.230> it's<00:01:57.590> not<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.040> move

wall ever moves it's not going to move

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.700 
wall ever moves it's not going to move
anything<00:01:58.640> because<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.300> consistent<00:01:59.720> two

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
anything because it's a consistent two

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.890 
anything because it's a consistent two
by<00:02:00.890> six<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.280> runs<00:02:01.670> from<00:02:01.910> side<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:02.660> right

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
by six that runs from side see right

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.980 
by six that runs from side see right
there<00:02:03.080> boom<00:02:03.350> perfect<00:02:04.040> level<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.810> now<00:02:05.810> they're

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
the columns and then they bolt all the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
the columns and then they bolt all the
columns<00:02:30.709> also<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.910> can<00:02:32.030> see<00:02:32.150> there's<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.420> hole

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
columns also you can see there's a hole

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.000 
columns also you can see there's a hole
right<00:02:32.959> there<00:02:33.019> if<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.410> could<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.800> right<00:02:33.890> at

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
right there if you could see it right at

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.860 
right there if you could see it right at
the<00:02:34.099> bottom<00:02:34.489> that's<00:02:34.700> where<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> bolts<00:02:35.420> go<00:02:35.480> for

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
the bottom that's where the bolts go for

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.839 
the bottom that's where the bolts go for
the<00:02:35.959> columns<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> put<00:02:37.700> all<00:02:37.819> of

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
the columns I'm going to put all of

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.570 
the columns I'm going to put all of
those<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.260> I'll<00:02:39.379> screw<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
those on so I'll screw that all down and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.369 
those on so I'll screw that all down and
that's<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:40.970> important<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.290> want

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
that's really important because you want

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.780 
that's really important because you want
to<00:02:42.500> make<00:02:42.650> sure<00:02:42.830> those<00:02:43.010> are<00:02:43.040> nice<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.580> tight<00:02:43.760> so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
to make sure those are nice and tight so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.240 
to make sure those are nice and tight so
they<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.420> ever<00:02:44.660> move<00:02:45.019> because<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.129> is

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
they don't ever move because this is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.580 
they don't ever move because this is
where<00:02:46.459> all<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:47.090> our<00:02:47.239> bearing<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.110> right

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
where all of our bearing is going right

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.770 
where all of our bearing is going right
down<00:02:48.830> from<00:02:49.340> all<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.879> way<00:02:50.000> like<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.330> said<00:02:50.599> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
down from all the way like I said the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.250 
down from all the way like I said the
top<00:02:51.019> all<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.470> way<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.830> bottom<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:54.110> when

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
top all the way to the bottom and when

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.750 
top all the way to the bottom and when
they<00:02:54.349> finish<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.280> load<00:02:55.489> them<00:02:55.700> all

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
they finish all of this to load them all

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.940 
they finish all of this to load them all
up<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.299> could<00:02:56.420> start<00:02:56.629> framing<00:02:56.959> and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
up and then we could start framing and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.229 
up and then we could start framing and
that's<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.220> great<00:02:58.400> thing<00:02:58.459> because<00:02:58.880> we've<00:02:59.120> been
