00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.049
 A) Yes 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.960
 He stopped me commenting and good friends like 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.510
 you are watching in the title of that video 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.310
 Today I bring you the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.800
 unesco to wÃ­lder of my current team 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.460
 and good to say it's a team because it's a 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.360
 barclays team and it cost me about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.190
 250,000 friends we go to first you 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.970
 pick up since the template because here 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.970
 I have already made the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 I'm going to read wilder 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.050
 once 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.430
 at 43 34 which is what I have now 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 same and good let's start from goalkeeper 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.090
 we have to cry that is to direct better 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.790
 Well, it's amazing, it's a machine 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.440
 is one of the best goalkeepers in the game 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.770
 it is normal that before him he carries 13 validity 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 55 thousand or 60 thousand because it is incredible is 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 God 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 in the goal number of central by the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.380
 left we have a company compare 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 you can not do anything poker 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 of all perfect that is amazing 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.690
 company also compared to life 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.880
 Luis because I also had before and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.130
 it is also but not much better 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.899
 company 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.590
 and we not only have to see touch on that 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:45.259
 Luis because good is that many failures 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.750
 the truth I left side I know who 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.380
 it's not the best but by its means I 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.659
 I stay with him 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.140
 Ashley with the icon is a bit slow 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.140
 but good 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.180
 I stay with him by his average 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.640
 back right we have walker walker 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.390
 very fast although good has only one 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.850
 goal if I'm not wrong in all 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.200
 in all the matches I've done the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.209
 left lateral to the right and 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.780
 well I do not have much 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.480
 very good midfielder we have got 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.290
 the left we have ramirez 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.790
 ramiro I already have the last team not 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.099
 if I do not have past 13 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.019
 and well look is marked enough to be 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.569
 a midfielder and good fast enough 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.050
 between 90 and peak defensive pace 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.100
 we have nasri 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.240
 nobody also keeps it as much as 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.220
 ramirez because it 's good is a little more 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.830
 slow though the dribble is much better 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.830
 that ramirez half center to the right 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.920
 we have fellaini 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.230
 and it's also amazing fellaini when 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.240
 you play with him you're not like you're 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 very slow too high 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.330
 but it always gets in the most plays 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 most important and I was already marking 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.530
 many times and good highly recommended 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.050
 line and although good now it's very 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.690
 cheap good extreme left we have 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.610
 william william cost me in his day 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.730
 forty-odd thousand almost 50 thousand in a 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.370
 lane is by 30 thousand the first day 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.880
 it was incredible william the first thing that was 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.000
 very fast although I do not know when we 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.170
 They are used to it but well what 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.320
 that you have the special player is your 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 speed extreme right have we to 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.629
 na ni na nor the best that has its 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.269
 his dribble although the shot is fine 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.010
 it's pretty good and it's pretty good and 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.430
 well the star better said if the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.970
 Team star can be this 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.500
 samuel eto'o that has a very very rhythm 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.560
 quite high dribble also pretty 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.620
 high even though uncle 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.550
 the shot does not have very high 81 is the one 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.460
 it has more longshot I think it's william 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.360
 but good friends to tell you team 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.420
 well enough speed though shot shot 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.310
 does not have much shot of the truth and a 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.500
