00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.500
 networks are increasingly needed 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.600
 when we talk 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.479
 death of the popstar is one thing 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.349
 very very severe 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.669
 you should perform intelligence services while things are not 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.169
 would pass 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.779
 Magali 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.089
 the process 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.209
 76% said they trust it will be created 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.150
 adapt and people 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.900
 at the end of November they will have the opportunity to experience the culture in the snowy state 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.450
 which did not occur 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.990
 he 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.030
 with a team formed 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 with this the bets are many 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.580
 the other representatives of the state in the senate 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.820
 as happens in cities of the interior and at the end of the duel 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.260
 a little more 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.100
 is focused on the scientific part to accredit the archer 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 - I think we'll bring a risk contract. 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.810
 would be important according to our public 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.790
 so I do not have several central regions we have to comply with the state 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.810
 but the talk of the wood 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.980
 government decisions 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 I want to end this situation is very serious 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 yesterday as Mayor 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.490
 It's a very strong thing that was not working before. 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.840
 is one more of the finalists 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.020
 on internet broadband internet 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.620
 but we have evidence of terrorism 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.880
 starting with its high failure rate 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.910
 last month is a strong trend 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.930
 and it is not sabotaged by defects after the rescued ones 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.980
 both this is true but it is still not enough 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.180
 Why is it today? 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.220
 m 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.630
 there are numerous medical researches 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 I came here to make known the needs and convenience of fgv 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.450
 so have 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 many attractions 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.540
 between March 6 and 10 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.170
 There's a lot we could not do. 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.169
 there is not much time to reach this final 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.379
 that people sometimes can not even imagine 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.539
 we must do much 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.969
 one of them 26 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.089
 who received in his office being very 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.069
 the saruel pants 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.819
 not just for you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.350
 they are ahead 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.209
 want to bet on the markup 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.269
 the maracanÃ£ also after that it also marks the immediate beginning of the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 campaign 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.899
 so we try to do 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.209
 everything that goes unpunished says garden 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.499
 thing is me 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.419
 this feeling of freshness 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.159
 in Brazil 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.969
 were also involved in the Rio accident - the Brazilians beat the governments of the 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.099
 whole world 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.479
 the reservations 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.439
 products of the foreseen period 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.379
 Brazil 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.219
 We have a lot of Brazilian women. 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.579
 Christmas presents 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.619
 it also carries a point at 11 64% 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.799
 and what we find Brazilian petrochemicals and branding even knew it was 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.759
 serious 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.269
 also said that the negotiation 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.469
 want nothing to declare 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.999
 right after work 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.389
 bring some cool things wanted to get ready 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.599
 - We have to do this. 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.499
 If it does not work, let's see. 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.719
 It's another great success. 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.209
 the delegate on call 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.159
 emma be retested 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.479
 It has to be all very well thought that his name 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.499
 already the figueirense was 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.549
 companies that are very 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.350
 and 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.799
 many companies 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.959
 this time the concentration of the substance 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.769
 how does each one make his / her own? 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.169
 little 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.259
 also at the station has a long cold war 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.089
 before beginning the works without experience 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.149
 of those 26 49 and 60 months 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.779
 so we have a lot of symptoms 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:10.840
 therefore 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.689
 we are not a sustainable company at this time and a pity 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.919
 one with hrt is 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.919
 make your registration 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.160
 was 0-0 in the minho 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.059
 lack of goal puritans 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 so I'll stop with europe worry 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.130
 however the police 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.860
 to offer a product 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.900
 dilma will have to face 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.939
 but I must also thank 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.939
 this is not true is already aware 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.759
 consumption of products such as 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.620
 he still needs to leave 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 who guarantees that the strike has an opportunity 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 questioned 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.150
 all that galley 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 at the time the company 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.360
 I want to have the opportunity to know the company can develop andrea 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.400
 grow and move away from the European presidency
