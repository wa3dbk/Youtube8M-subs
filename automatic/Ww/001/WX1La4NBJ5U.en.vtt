00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 We're going to make a recipe for you to be as happy as you are 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.090
 cookie 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.110
 The cookies are the fundamental key of this recipe that we are going to make. I will 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.900
 make a very rich and very easy cookie cream. We are going to use 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.499
 Maria cookies 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:24.159
 I have opted for the "golden" type but the others are also good 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.529
 we will also use 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.810
 cream, caramel, sugar, curd and a little cold milk 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530
 to dissolve the curd. And that's it! Very easy 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.300
 This recipe is also anti stress 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.090
 because we are going to catch 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 all cookies that are almost an entire package and we're going to crush them 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 you can do it with a special shredder or you can hit it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.080
 inside a bag with a hammer or whatever you want but I would 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.660
 I'm going to do it with my hands because I'm going to give you a little trick a little bit later 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.670
 the next step: add the cream 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 let's moisten the cookies 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.090
 with the cream 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.630
 then we are going to take sugar 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.980
 candy 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.010
 we give you some little rides 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.780
 and now my trick 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 I'm going to beat 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.080
 the cookies, which are already wet and soft, I'm going to crush them 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.039
 with the blender 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.759
 with milk sugar candy 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.040
 Next step: 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.840
 dissolve the curd in the cold milk 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.659
 let's toss in a saucepan 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.059
 the previous mixture 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.299
 we are going to put it 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.759
 in the fire to cook 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.989
 spinning around watching 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.649
 preventing it from boiling 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.469
 is about to boil at this time we incorporate 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.519
 the dissolved curd 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.519
 in milk 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.789
 and we go on 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.239
 circling 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.299
 at a low temperature for eight minutes 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.139
 between 5 and 8 minutes, when you see that it is hard for you to go around 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.559
 It is already beginning to take shape and it is time to serve 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.639
 and now let's do some 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.759
 for kids 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:48.229
 after serving in our cups 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:52.040
 corresponding the cream of cookies, we have put it in the refrigerator 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 at least it has to be two hours before serving it so that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.999
 your diners eat it
