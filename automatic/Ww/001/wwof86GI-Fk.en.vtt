sometimes when I have done it it does it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
sometimes when I have done it it does it
just<00:01:02.430> doesn't<00:01:03.059> work<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> doesn't<00:01:03.780> do

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
just doesn't work you know it doesn't do

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
just doesn't work you know it doesn't do
anything<00:01:04.369> sometimes<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
slight chance it works but it's not the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
slight chance it works but it's not the
most<00:01:08.520> efficient<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.510> most<00:01:09.659> efficient

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
most efficient way the most efficient

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.210 
most efficient way the most efficient
way<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> show<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.040> guys

way is that I'm going to show you guys

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
way is that I'm going to show you guys
right<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.119> simplest<00:01:12.479> way<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.260> go

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
right now is the simplest way is just go

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.550 
right now is the simplest way is just go
into<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.680> app<00:01:13.799> store<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.170> all<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
into your app store and all you really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
into your app store and all you really
need<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.400> download<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.119> app

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
need to do is just download an app

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
need to do is just download an app
that's<00:01:18.720> all<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.320> need<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.729> basically<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's all you need to do basically the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
that's all you need to do basically the
reason<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.420> happens<00:01:21.780> I've<00:01:22.020> heard<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
reason that this happens I've heard is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
reason that this happens I've heard is
because<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> plug<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.490> iPod<00:01:23.700> or

because when you plug in your iPod or

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.499 
because when you plug in your iPod or
iPhone<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.750> iPad<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> computer<00:01:26.420> when<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
iPhone or iPad into a computer when you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.450 
iPhone or iPad into a computer when you
when<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.110> syncing<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.220> after

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
when you're syncing it all up after

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.649 
when you're syncing it all up after
you're<00:01:29.579> done<00:01:29.670> downloading<00:01:30.180> everything

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you're done downloading everything

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.219 
you're done downloading everything
it<00:01:31.470> loses<00:01:31.740> authentic<00:01:32.430> ization<00:01:32.990> needed<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it loses authentic ization needed to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
it loses authentic ization needed to
download<00:01:34.470> apps<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.159> basically<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
download apps so basically and you just

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.609

and<00:02:13.799> then<00:02:14.799> once<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.400> starts<00:02:16.060> downloading

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360

you will be able to open all your apps
most<00:02:21.700> likely<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.330> I'm<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.019> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.440> wait

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
most likely and I'm just going to wait

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.100 
most likely and I'm just going to wait
for<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.250> download<00:02:24.670> okay<00:02:25.510> I'm<00:02:25.629> actually<00:02:25.780> going

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
for the download okay I'm actually going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.140 
for the download okay I'm actually going
to<00:02:26.200> fast<00:02:26.620> forward<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.040> part<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.700> my

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
to fast forward this part because my

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.850 
to fast forward this part because my
internet<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.750> said<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.019> extremely<00:02:29.709> slow

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
internet like I said is extremely slow

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530 
internet like I said is extremely slow
so<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.549> probably<00:02:30.879> going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> take<00:02:31.180> quite

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so it's probably going to take quite

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.630 
so it's probably going to take quite
some<00:02:31.720> time<00:02:31.780> for<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> download<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:33.610> I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
some time for this to download and so I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.130 
some time for this to download and so I
