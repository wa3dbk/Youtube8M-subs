00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.510
 android is an extremely system 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.279
 versatile one of the less distributions 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.869
 widespread but surely we will start a 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.360
 see on the market so much more 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.189
 incisive in the coming months and android tv 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.050
 a system suitable for the use of 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.029
 multimedia content but also to the game 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.950
 and if until now regarding the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.600
 videogame panorama you were forced to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.550
 casual games or other non-titles 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.170
 triple everything seems destined to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.090
 change thanks to the ship consor 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.010
 presented by nvidia during the game 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.210
 This year's developers conference a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.680
 product that uses precisely 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 the android and mila ecosystem to be 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.850
 a low cost console but with a huge one 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.530
 in fact, the potential and versatility 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.750
 first real console to use android 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.520
 tv the hardware inside is definitely 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 interesting with the debut of the soc 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.620
 tegra x1 a cpi opts core with 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.120
 big.little 64-bit technology but 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.670
 especially a gpu based on 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.320
 maxwell architecture with as many as 256 cuda 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 core to guarantee a considerable 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.240
 performance jump compared to 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.920
 previous tegra k1 although clock is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 cp hook and gpu are not 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.640
 been officially released by 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.560
 several tests available online can be done 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.020
 discover that the gpu's core clock arrives 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.479
 up to 1GB and memory up to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.780
 1.6 g 20 to support the new technician 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.950
 finally we have 3 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.360
 even if the features are 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.880
 definitely good for a device 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.620
 based on android seems obvious that not 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.680
 can compete with home consoles 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.930
 like the ps4 and the xbox one at the level of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.729
 pure computing power but nvidia reality 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.440
 does not aim too hard at brute power 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.250
 this console how much to push the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.320
 own service 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.850
 nvidia grip for those unfamiliar with it 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 this service allows streaming 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.479
 via the internet 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.280
 PC titles that run remotely on 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.930
 server in libya the only prerequisite 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.270
 will be a decent internet connection 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.430
 that in Italy we hope to arrive soon 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 obviously grid service will have a cost 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.420
 that still hasn't been formalized but 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.729
 should according to the representatives of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.380
 nvidia be as competitive as possible 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.090
 we also talk about different types of 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.369
 subscriptions that will give access to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.980
 a list of everything basic while those 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.629
 more recent will have a cost if next 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.010
 let's not forget about this service 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.810
 have all google services 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 and a multimedia center of everything 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.500
 respect that thanks to the power of the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.470
 chip tegra x1 allows you to view 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.489
 movies up to 4k at 60 frames per 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.930
 second 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.610
 his mandile starts a small one 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 revolution starts from the android world 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.970
 we can't wait to spend some time 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.069
 of time with the new shield console that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.220
 in america starts at a price of 199 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.930
 dollars with a check and locked up for 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.489
 this very short episode of droid e 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.870
 I recommend everything to leave us 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.400
 your opinions on this new product 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.349
 in full comments to leave a mi 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 like it if you liked the video invitation 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.319
 also to join the tom's channel 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.940
 hardware italy and maybe to come to 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.120
 make a jump also on my to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 next
