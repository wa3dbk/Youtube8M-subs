troops<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> jump<00:00:59.760> spell<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.149> dropped<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.720> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
troops so jump spell is dropped and the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.420 
troops so jump spell is dropped and the
whole<00:01:01.170> idea<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> king<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.040> going<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
whole idea is that the king is going to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630 
whole idea is that the king is going to
go<00:01:03.229> do<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> enemy<00:01:04.650> queen<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.040> right<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:05.489> is

is a bit busy with the Khan castle
troops<00:01:07.770> oh<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.280> guess<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> lightning<00:01:08.970> spell

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
troops oh I guess the lightning spell

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
troops oh I guess the lightning spell
wasn't<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:10.200> effective<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.250> still

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
wasn't that effective but it's still

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060 
wasn't that effective but it's still
enough<00:01:12.020> these<00:01:13.020> heroes<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:13.920> high

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
enough these heroes are still high

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
enough these heroes are still high
enough<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> enemy<00:01:18.210> Queen<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.690> now<00:01:19.170> he

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
enough to get the enemy Queen and now he

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
enough to get the enemy Queen and now he
starts<00:01:19.440> at<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> lava<00:01:19.979> attack<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> hopefully

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
starts at the lava attack and hopefully

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.820 
starts at the lava attack and hopefully
the<00:01:21.479> queen<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.380> before<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the queen is going to go now before the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
the queen is going to go now before the
lavas<00:01:23.190> rich<00:01:23.430> turn<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:24.119> start<00:01:24.360> taking<00:01:24.690> damage

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
lavas rich turn will start taking damage

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.990 
lavas rich turn will start taking damage
from<00:01:25.020> those<00:01:25.380> air<00:01:25.530> defenses<00:01:26.070> he's<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.759> take

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
from those air defenses he's gonna take

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.020 
from those air defenses he's gonna take
out<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:28.259> secondary<00:01:29.039> defense<00:01:29.429> and<00:01:29.759> that's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
out that secondary defense and that's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
out that secondary defense and that's
exactly<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.660> happens<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.220> attack

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
exactly what happens so this attack

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.279 
exactly what happens so this attack
should<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.539> three<00:01:33.840> love<00:01:33.990> us<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
should go well you get three love us and

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.639 
should go well you get three love us and
to<00:01:34.440> our<00:01:34.470> differences<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:36.390> base<00:01:36.630> 11<00:01:37.410> have

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
to our differences and this base 11 have

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.440 
to our differences and this base 11 have
any<00:01:37.890> chance<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:39.020> standing<00:01:40.020> such<00:01:40.440> an<00:01:40.590> attack<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
any chance of standing such an attack so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
any chance of standing such an attack so
the<00:01:42.450> whole<00:01:42.570> idea<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.899> cola<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.190> golems

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the whole idea of cola with two golems

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.260 
the whole idea of cola with two golems
is<00:01:45.920> taking<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.070> defenses<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:48.060> seen

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
is taking out your defenses I've seen

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
is taking out your defenses I've seen
that<00:01:48.479> many<00:01:48.679> not<00:01:49.679> many<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.160> some<00:01:50.220> are

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that many not many but some are

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
that many not many but some are
sometimes<00:01:51.450> taking<00:01:51.989> two<00:01:52.140> golems<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.099> out

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
sometimes taking two golems to take out

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.279 
sometimes taking two golems to take out
one<00:01:53.640> air<00:01:53.789> defense<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.330> then<00:01:54.780> running<00:01:55.050> out<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
one air defense and then running out of

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.949 
one air defense and then running out of
time<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.099> able<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.789> base<00:01:56.959> so

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
time or not able to get the base so

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.330 
time or not able to get the base so
that's<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.709> common<00:01:58.979> mistake<00:01:59.099> and<00:01:59.580> I<00:01:59.729> think<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that's a common mistake and I think that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
that's a common mistake and I think that
it<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.580> hard<00:02:02.880> getting<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.360> tree<00:02:03.569> starts

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it will be hard getting a tree starts

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
it will be hard getting a tree starts
you're<00:02:04.020> taking<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:05.009> wasting<00:02:05.489> two

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you're taking if you're wasting two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
you're taking if you're wasting two
golems<00:02:05.910> on<00:02:06.239> only<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.660> air<00:02:06.840> defense<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
golems on only one air defense so the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380 
golems on only one air defense so the
star<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.170> done<00:02:10.410> properly<00:02:11.239> taking<00:02:12.239> out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
star it was done properly taking out

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
star it was done properly taking out
your<00:02:12.420> defenses<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.340> next

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
your defenses and we can go to the next

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.590 
your defenses and we can go to the next
attack

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.500 

another<00:02:22.530> goal<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.010> attack<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.210> time<00:02:24.390> is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
another goal of attack and this time is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
another goal of attack and this time is
using<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.110> golem<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:27.830> same<00:02:28.830> thing<00:02:29.130> goes<00:02:29.640> here

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
using one golem and same thing goes here

to drop the rage spell pretty deep

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
to drop the rage spell pretty deep
because<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.490> doesn't<00:03:26.550> really<00:03:26.940> matter<00:03:27.530> if<00:03:28.530> your

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
because it doesn't really matter if your

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.010 
because it doesn't really matter if your
balloons<00:03:29.610> are<00:03:29.850> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.300> faster<00:03:30.810> or

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
balloons are going to get faster or

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.230 
balloons are going to get faster or
slower<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.800> want<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> level<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.550> step<00:03:32.820> up<00:03:32.970> and

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
slower you want the level up step up and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.780 
slower you want the level up step up and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
if you're taking more love us then our

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.870 
if you're taking more love us then our
defenses<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.950> got<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> make<00:03:38.370> sure<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
defenses you got to make sure that the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.930 
defenses you got to make sure that the
love<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.180> ups<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.130> one<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> weight<00:03:41.580> of

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
love of ups and one of the weight of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900 
love of ups and one of the weight of
doing<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:43.100> dropping<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> Rachel<00:03:44.640> pretty

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
doing that is dropping the Rachel pretty

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.910 
doing that is dropping the Rachel pretty
deep<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.600> doesn't<00:03:45.870> reach<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.290> balloons<00:03:46.560> to

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
deep so it doesn't reach the balloons to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.990 
deep so it doesn't reach the balloons to
their<00:03:47.130> defense<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.820> rather<00:03:49.310> get<00:03:50.310> them<00:03:50.520> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
their defense but rather get them to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.440 
their defense but rather get them to
attack<00:03:51.270> all<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.840> defenses<00:03:52.350> in<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.740> core<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
attack all the defenses in the core and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.870 
attack all the defenses in the core and
this<00:03:54.450> way<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.780> love<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.050> pop<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.400> lava<00:03:56.610> pops

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
this way the love of pop the lava pops

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.420 
this way the love of pop the lava pops
as<00:03:57.090> well<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.800> course<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> balloons

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
as well and and of course the balloons

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.930 
as well and and of course the balloons
are<00:03:59.580> taking<00:03:59.910> out<00:04:00.560> some<00:04:01.560> core<00:04:01.920> core<00:04:02.430> defenses

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
are taking out some core core defenses

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.590 
are taking out some core core defenses
and<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> way<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.440> do<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:05.240> it's<00:04:06.240> very

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and this is the way to do it it's very

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.810 
and this is the way to do it it's very
delicate<00:04:08.090> using<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:10.110> lavas<00:04:10.610> you're<00:04:11.610> going<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
delicate using the lavas you're going to

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
delicate using the lavas you're going to
make<00:04:11.940> sure<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.360> they<00:04:12.480> pop<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:14.630> right<00:04:15.630> now

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
make sure that they pop and right now

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.570 
make sure that they pop and right now
we're<00:04:16.020> going<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.320> see<00:04:16.500> another<00:04:16.920> attack<00:04:17.370> by

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
we're going to see another attack by

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.500 
we're going to see another attack by
Jasper<00:04:18.109> two<00:04:19.109> golems<00:04:19.350> are<00:04:19.620> used<00:04:20.750> and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.810 

I<00:04:24.540> think<00:04:24.750> he<00:04:24.870> could<00:04:25.020> use<00:04:25.260> one<00:04:25.590> column<00:04:25.980> he's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
I think he could use one column he's

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.550 
I think he could use one column he's
only<00:04:26.970> aiming<00:04:27.420> for<00:04:27.660> one<00:04:27.870> air<00:04:28.050> defence<00:04:28.380> from

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
only aiming for one air defence from

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.000 
only aiming for one air defence from
what<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.890> could<00:04:29.010> see<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.550> maybe<00:04:30.540> his<00:04:30.990> his<00:04:31.680> idea

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
what I could see but maybe his his idea

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.250 
what I could see but maybe his his idea
is<00:04:32.250> getting<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.000> core<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.390> maybe<00:04:33.840> taking

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
is getting to the core and maybe taking

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.890 
is getting to the core and maybe taking
out<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.760> expose<00:04:35.760> wall<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:36.600> can<00:04:36.720> see

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
out that expose wall so as you can see

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.890 
out that expose wall so as you can see
the<00:04:37.080> jobs<00:04:37.470> ball<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.830> dropped<00:04:38.540> in<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.690> great

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
the jobs ball is dropped in a great

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.530 
the jobs ball is dropped in a great
place<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.500> with<00:04:40.950> such<00:04:41.310> level<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.180> Heroes

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
place and with such level of Heroes

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.650 
place and with such level of Heroes
level<00:04:42.930> maxed<00:04:43.560> almost<00:04:44.220> max<00:04:44.460> heroes<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.420> ten

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
level maxed almost max heroes for ten

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.010 
level maxed almost max heroes for ten
all<00:04:45.810> nine<00:04:47.210> even<00:04:48.210> if<00:04:48.300> you're<00:04:48.450> taking<00:04:48.660> two

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
all nine even if you're taking two

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.650 
all nine even if you're taking two
golems<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:50.490> can<00:04:50.670> still<00:04:51.590> get<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.620> max<00:04:52.950> base

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
golems you can still get a max base

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.000 
golems you can still get a max base
pretty<00:04:54.660> easily<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.110> one<00:04:55.380> air<00:04:55.500> defense<00:04:55.800> goes

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
pretty easily so one air defense goes

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.010 
pretty easily so one air defense goes
down<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:58.880> those<00:04:59.880> heroes<00:05:00.330> are<00:05:00.360> enough<00:05:00.780> to

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
down and those heroes are enough to

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.600 
down and those heroes are enough to
wreck<00:05:01.260> half<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.890> bass<00:05:02.100> alone<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:04.680> love<00:05:04.860> us<00:05:05.010> to

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
the description as always I put put it

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.030 
the description as always I put put it
up<00:05:51.090> on<00:05:51.690> every<00:05:51.960> video<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.380> base<00:05:55.590> is<00:05:55.620> going

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
up on every video so this base is going

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.530 
up on every video so this base is going
down<00:05:56.190> pretty<00:05:56.550> easily<00:05:56.700> when<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.150> Queen<00:05:57.390> is

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
down pretty easily when the Queen is

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.130 
down pretty easily when the Queen is
still<00:05:57.570> alive<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:59.120> as<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.210> can<00:06:00.360> see<00:06:00.390> to<00:06:00.690> it<00:06:00.720> was

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
still alive and as you can see to it was

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.510 
still alive and as you can see to it was
a<00:06:01.170> bit<00:06:01.380> hard<00:06:01.410> taking<00:06:01.860> out<00:06:02.070> all<00:06:02.100> of<00:06:02.310> the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
a bit hard taking out all of the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.340 
a bit hard taking out all of the
defences<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.420> think<00:06:03.630> that<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:03.870> reason<00:06:03.900> was

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
defences and I think that the reason was

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.620 
defences and I think that the reason was
using<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:04.830> balance<00:06:05.340> you<00:06:05.880> don't<00:06:06.090> need<00:06:06.300> two

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
using to balance you don't need two

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.160 
using to balance you don't need two
golems<00:06:07.100> for<00:06:08.100> such<00:06:08.280> a<00:06:08.310> base<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:12.630> would<00:06:12.930> take

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
golems for such a base and I would take

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.980 
golems for such a base and I would take
for<00:06:13.590> love<00:06:13.800> us<00:06:13.980> and<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:14.820> one<00:06:15.360> column<00:06:15.720> instead

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
for love us and and one column instead

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.500 
for love us and and one column instead
and<00:06:16.380> it<00:06:17.100> would<00:06:17.250> be<00:06:17.280> much<00:06:17.580> better<00:06:17.640> in<00:06:18.270> my

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
and it would be much better in my

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.750 
and it would be much better in my
opinion<00:06:18.540> so<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.470> last<00:06:19.650> attack<00:06:19.920> we're<00:06:20.580> going

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
opinion so the last attack we're going

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.690 
opinion so the last attack we're going
to<00:06:20.970> see<00:06:21.120> in<00:06:21.210> this<00:06:21.270> war<00:06:21.510> a<00:06:21.540> cap<00:06:22.070> is<00:06:23.070> a<00:06:23.130> coronis

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
to see in this war a cap is a coronis

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.850 
to see in this war a cap is a coronis
attack<00:06:24.060> on<00:06:24.390> number<00:06:24.810> eight

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.010 

so<00:06:28.860> almost<00:06:29.220> maxed<00:06:29.730> our<00:06:30.030> online<00:06:30.360> including<00:06:30.660> the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
so almost maxed our online including the

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.140 
so almost maxed our online including the
walls<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.590> he's<00:06:31.950> going<00:06:32.130> to<00:06:32.220> do<00:06:32.370> I<00:06:32.610> think<00:06:32.970> it's

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
walls and he's going to do I think it's

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.540 
walls and he's going to do I think it's
a<00:06:33.210> Penta<00:06:33.570> attack<00:06:33.840> so<00:06:34.410> three<00:06:34.770> lavas<00:06:35.130> are<00:06:35.250> going

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
a Penta attack so three lavas are going

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.510 
a Penta attack so three lavas are going
first<00:06:36.320> to<00:06:37.320> their<00:06:37.470> defense<00:06:37.800> which<00:06:38.040> is<00:06:38.190> closer

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
first to their defense which is closer

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.120 
first to their defense which is closer
to<00:06:38.670> the<00:06:39.000> Queen<00:06:39.240> and<00:06:39.480> is<00:06:40.170> actually<00:06:40.440> raging<00:06:41.100> the

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
to the Queen and is actually raging the

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.520 
to the Queen and is actually raging the
way<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.520> their<00:06:41.910> differences<00:06:42.420> will<00:06:44.450> but

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
way to their differences will but

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.890 
way to their differences will but
there's<00:06:46.530> a<00:06:46.650> bath<00:06:46.890> passing<00:06:47.570> do<00:06:48.570> that<00:06:48.750> air

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
there's a bath passing do that air

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.690 
there's a bath passing do that air
defense<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:49.500> we<00:06:49.620> take<00:06:49.800> some<00:06:49.980> time<00:06:50.220> till<00:06:50.550> those

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
defense so we take some time till those

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.030 
defense so we take some time till those
balloons<00:06:51.090> are<00:06:51.630> getting<00:06:52.320> to<00:06:52.500> their<00:06:52.680> defense

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
balloons are getting to their defense

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.140 
balloons are getting to their defense

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
without luring there might be two

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.880 
without luring there might be two
reasons<00:07:14.670> one<00:07:15.630> there<00:07:16.050> is<00:07:16.140> a<00:07:16.170> witch<00:07:16.440> in<00:07:16.590> the<00:07:16.620> clan

reasons one there is a witch in the clan

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.090 
reasons one there is a witch in the clan
castle<00:07:16.920> and<00:07:17.460> maybe<00:07:17.640> more<00:07:18.090> more<00:07:18.690> useless

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.100 
castle and maybe more more useless

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.610 
castle and maybe more more useless
troops<00:07:20.100> against<00:07:20.490> air<00:07:20.910> attacks<00:07:21.300> like<00:07:22.110> balloons

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
basically a which is enough is usually

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.760 
basically a which is enough is usually
enough<00:07:28.710> to<00:07:29.550> make<00:07:29.730> a<00:07:29.760> Penta<00:07:30.210> attack<00:07:30.450> work<00:07:31.440> well

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770
