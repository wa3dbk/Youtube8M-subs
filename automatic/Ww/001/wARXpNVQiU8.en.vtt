00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.800
 when the girls are so happy to see you again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.460
 on my channel and today you finally 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.790
 you know 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 do i need to buy carmix ios nakid and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 all sorts of different other advertised 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.119
 youtube and products or not today 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'll tell you the most truthful and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.920
 honest and video so let's let's 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.580
 let's start the first thing which 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.040
 would like to tell this balm from ios 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 To be honest, I would not love him how much 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 since I tried to try it, I 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.380
 I understand that he really 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 natural really not bad 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.879
 moisturizes but its properties are so 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.149
 overvalued so much advertised 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.460
 in fact he is not so caring 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.950
 for lips not so and heals as 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 for example the same popular u 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.030
 tuba oil for lips from nivea which 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 is my most awesome 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 favorite I really do not stop 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 say what he is really good 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.430
 work though it and here it is chemical 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.830
 here is nonsense in my opinion it is just but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 he doesn't look bad he is nice 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.990
 copes with dry lips 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 somewhere literally half an hour I think him 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 would be best to use such 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 wet water I don't know but on my 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.159
 look he is not worth his money absolutely 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.560
 and advertising is also the next thing which 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.520
 although it was a survey 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 it will call loved ones is also very famous 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.850
 balsam which is all for seems iherb with 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.520
 all the different sites guys let's 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 will be true lip balm grain not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.439
 can we heal the lips so much that you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.189
 just for a second and in my opinion this 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 near tex, this balm is also not much 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.960
 incredible it doesnâ€™t so much moisturize 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.540
 lips like the same butter days wine he 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 more nutritious in my opinion and he 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.909
 more so heavy i'm in love and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.729
 wear it at night and he is then well 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.509
 copes with cracks on the lips 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.450
 that's why I think you guys know 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.069
 best to use such things 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.140
 along with something to alternate them 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.489
 one here is one product and you can't 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.049
 choose because he is definitely not 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.790
 deal with all these problems 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.310
 there must be a natural product and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.290
 chemical product and see me come and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.999
 moisturizing product only then from it 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.879
 will receive all care completely 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.739
 which the next thing you want is a corr 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.450
 max and here and for some reason carboxy 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 in two ways and not someone says that he told me 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 like someone says like 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.359
 on the contrary , I like the most and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.819
 system of products that are named besides 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.439
 Oil for withdrawal not believing in general Carl x 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.169
 this is really a thing that is mine 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.760
 the look works fine because during 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.590
 first do not like what I feel he 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.590
 works it starts to get cold my lips 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.840
 and you know he is not quite unpleasant 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.060
 the smell is so average what it says 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.669
 the fact that he is more pharmacist and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.290
 and do not need to use every day but 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.530
 when you use it great 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 affects the lips he heals them well 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.989
 he is such a valday consistency that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.699
 is also very good for the lips seems to me that 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.319
 that he is more nutritious is not so 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.900
 light is not so fast absorbed 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.180
 not so quickly evaporate from the lips so i 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 I think that if you choose between all 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.129
 Tim Burton and which I advised you 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 I think it's better to choose correct 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.570
 and lip butter is one 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160
 these things are worth aa 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.080
 natural gases are better at all 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.330
 use some oil let's say 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.070
 argan oil and jojoba oil in order 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.550
 to nourish and moisturize the plow in order 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.200
 not all the time to stuff them with chemistry 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.900
 now talk about something like 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.209
 balsams are not balsams which 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.520
 are called Lex maker and let's talk 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.850
 it's frankly really in them 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.950
 special enjoy and no there he is not 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.950
 as useful as the same 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.750
 most any near tex and his even 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.750
 can not be called some chemically 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.940
 useful because it's just nice 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.060
 I advise girls who are 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.890
 there is a bedroom there or let's say 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.570
 lift your mood to pamper yourself 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.250
 the fact that the type of google smells good 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.370
 chocolate became melon 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.260
 but in fact even I was surprised the new 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.350
 wondrous fate same nalchik who shine 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.090
 liquid lip smacker in my opinion nourishes 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.010
 and moisturizes sponges much better than 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.060
 advertised means balms 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.490
 and we cut it off too 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.320
 such more more snag that is so 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.419
 lasia money for advertising and in fact 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.250
 you don't get you wetting it 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.740
 food that is needed for your lips 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.050
 if you just and you know the principal and 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.150
 Light is they do not have if you choose between 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.350
 maker in the object I advise you 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 baby lips because he really 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.710
 moisturizes and it really has color 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.380
 alex maker this is more advertised 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.880
 vintage so but this whole group 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.890
 vkontakte and by the way if you remember my 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.810
 I review a little previous review 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.540
 otherwise I said it was not in principle 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.940
 liked the maker but when i get 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.980
 more mature when I analyze more when 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.810
 I'm starting to understand what I'm crying for 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.550
 why i like death maybe 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.470
 because all they say about him can be 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.690
 because everyone speaks wonderful 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.600
 all photos in instagram are not on 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.700
 Tambler about to dare their own and that in 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.340
 his own is that guys if you him 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.860
 who will but if you did not buy it I 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.480
 I advise you to buy, I can lay 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.610
 look like behaving like clinics 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.140
 prices are a little more expensive to us but he 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.010
 really moisturizes lips and 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.320
 gives so much 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.240
 so natural looking lip make it easier 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.760
 u true if you like luxury 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.070
 Todorov cosmetics will be fine if 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.380
 do you want to care for lips use 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.210
 one lipstick on daily makeup too 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.330
 great if you want to invest 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.330
 money in lipstick will suit you 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.340
 I advise you very much and now 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.650
 left lipstick we answer online 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.280
 by the edge very very often i see them in 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.290
 reviews 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.990
 different bloggers and just want to say 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.850
 one yes indeed such lipstick it 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.500
 great products they can not 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.230
 advise girls who often 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.050
 go to parties for some evenings 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.580
 some event holidays or 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.890
 shoot a video just like me 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.570
 really texture is not wonderful 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.190
 they are very good on the lips 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.560
 quite long hold and looks 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.890
 wonderful both on camera and generally on 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.410
 photos and live looks great 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.390
 never soak know never 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.550
 happens not to be rolled in white 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.160
 the strip never happens that you don't 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.590
 erased stained is wonderful 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.470
 made of lipstick but they are very bad 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.410
 acts on the lips they take off their lips they 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.830
 very dry them and then lips just in 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.140
 shocked 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.760
 so I think that every girl 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.770
 there must be such a model 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.260
 go on a date don't worry about 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.420
 make-up go to some holiday but 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.040
 every day girls in Ukraine 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.200
 I bought you 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.660
 well that's all I hope you had 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.370
 interesting and useful this video and I really 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.010
 tried hard to speak as much as possible 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.810
 honest and just here as a spirit as self 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.580
 myself because I really am 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.220
 now really talking to myself 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.840
 in fact, that is, girls do not have you very much 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.890
 love and want you to spend money 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.080

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.970
