00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.870
 in frankfurt it is like that 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.910
 actually no matter where you are from 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.650
 quite simply as frankfurter points 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.440
 format frankfurt is the first 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.050
 Documentary of the frankfurt as a whole 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.230
 portrayed in the context of this film 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.840
 we talked to over 50 people resp 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.609
 More than 50 people are in front of the camera 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.070
 were also very enthusiastic frankly 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.920
 about the great resonance easy 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.649
 then have made it to the film 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.120
 the 30 people do not have that right now 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.300
 to do that one was good and 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.640
 the other less good but easy 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.730
 has systematically fitted which areas 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200
 Finally in the movie we are now 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.010
 up here on the steeple of 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.649
 fechenheim 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 i did community service here and 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.989
 could therefore really these too 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.469
 enjoy and promising my fill from above 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.270
 see 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.530
 Frankfurt is a draw instead 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.840
 that's why there is not that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.240
 typical frankfurter so if those are 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.240
 then it would of course be with 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 clichés like apple at and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.750
 the whole field of comfort so now 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.350
 not somehow spritzigkeit or the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 coziness 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 So when we started out so radically 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850
 Of course cooking was regional 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.890
 first thing we realized 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.820
 So much is not so completely 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.220
 many things are taken for granted 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 are there just is not for us 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 but that's interesting and that's why 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 I also believe that we all him 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.010
 especially restaurant are or would be 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.180
 if you hear format frankfurt now 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.890
 then you probably think first 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 some publishing or some time 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 book or something because of format 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.510
 but it is in itself easy 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.730
 documentary 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.190
 we thought that format is in 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.050
 principle quite simple because it is that 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.940
 frankfurter format and frankfurter 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.010
 are and the people are the purpose 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.230
 are drawn and just important too 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.790
 not only people always show that 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.110
 live here or the first since one 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 week lives here but really the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.190
 Diversity and really what frankfurt 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 So it's all social layers 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.360
 all kinds of people get sick so that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.550
 the city with the most multicultural 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.040
 Share what I think is very good because here 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.690
 many nationalities are very good 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
 get along with each other and one by one 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.470
 just a bit like this 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.440
 can live out international flair 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.060
 and also know many other cultures 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.190
 can learn and as well as others 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.290
 nationalities tick as they are on it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.920
 and that's what you have in frankfurt 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.860
 extremely I grew up with it and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.220
 have a lot of different things 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.530
 get to know nationalities 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.170
 In 2010 we are both private and with 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.620
 our film production company here after 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.050
 frankfurt come here for imagefilms 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.790
 and product films and such things 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.030
 produce and then we have 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 established as monsters settled in here 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.360
 after the first weeks that was 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.769
 actually not really 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.930
 We really know where we are here now 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.580
 landed with our location in 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.980
 frankfurt gallusviertel so 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.410
 hauptbahnhof römer part of the hotspots in 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.390
 frankfurt but you knew something so im 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.769
 own quarter was what maybe now 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.410
 not directly in the city center area 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.260
 is that we did not know that 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.640
 and then we have people too 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.769
 get to know them as well 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 frankfurt is easy to draw one 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.310
 instead of other people as well 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.930
 like us why not maybe 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.489
 make my film about it and had so 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 We then have the idea to say we can 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.180
 just once make a film which we 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.270
 show people in frankfurt live the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.310
 work here and show us or 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.240
 other people show something here 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.710
 frankfurt and what it is here 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.270
 special 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.830
 There is still a lot I can do 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.810
 remember when I first came from 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.480
 mainz out to Frankfurt 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.030
 there we passed the Messeturm and 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.350
 came past this Hemmelmann there 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.650
 I have then really figurative 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.050
 seen and felt what this city is for 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.150
 has exerted a fascination before and 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.790
 like me, everyone here 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.100
 Day was suppose something happened here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.690
 Beats a heart and that's why I think 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.450
 This city is also very charming and 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.860
 fascinating the special about the film 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.840
 In my opinion, that is also us 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.180
 very different people 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.370
 have or people in the movie 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.500
 this goes from the students to the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.000
 pensioner 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.800
 different social different 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 cultural backgrounds 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.080
 I think there is a very wide range 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.420
 audience and really let the 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.260
 Frankfurt population throughout 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.600
 come word 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.060
 where I am not necessarily now 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.040
 this very metropolitan but it 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.170
 is a bit quieter 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.180
 and little fat little man has once 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.890
 So somebody said that belongs too 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.160
 frankfurts I've heard that too 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.320
 not only big streets to frankfurt 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.810
 what is he three four-lane highway 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.540
 or car roads are also whole 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.360
 small is no traffic at all and 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.640
 i am simply fascinated by this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.010
 varied easy while you are 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.220
 of rotation has me personally especially 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.340
 impressed the goddess werner who has the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.230
 the so-called kulturpass develops this 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.360
 is a possibility for social 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.170
 disadvantaged frankfurters and 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.780
 frankfurter at cheap 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.890
 entrance fees to the cultural life in 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.400
 to be able to participate in Frankfurt 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.440
 You can survive in Frankfurt 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.540
 that means you can give it to the brother 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.970
 Wendelin for breakfast for 50 cents to 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.350
 For example, where people are the little money 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.940
 there are churches there are those 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.320
 frankfurter Tafel fell but eventually 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.720
 me even if you go theater now 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.289
 Do you want the museum can all the people 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.199
 not at all 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.689
 because the money is just so awful and 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.849
 then I thought about the cultural passport 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.439
 yes so I think that the movie before 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.749
 Everything that makes it special that it is 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.969
 is unadorned or honest 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:52.580
 So here's really how to show 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.589
 frankfurt is we show people what 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.509
 Also very important is we allow ourselves 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.729
 now no one off to comment 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.949
 speak speak they really only show 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.659
 The people in front of the camera like theirs 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.430
 make statements and testify 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.319
 would not be rated somehow now 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.210
 or changed anyway 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.639
 we just show the honesty of 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.740
 people the criticism what is positive and 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.539
 so to speak I think that way you can 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.149
 very good wide bow show how 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.740
 Frankfurt really is that there 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:20.779
 happens what happens today 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.110
 So there is now of song are the 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:25.969
 peak long so beautiful stores warning 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.550
 it would have been something that comes here 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.309
 creative good people here so 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.159
 planned is the publication of the 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:37.629
 Films here in frankfurt with a 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.949
 Maybe then release another movie 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.209
 demonstrations here in frankfurt possibly 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.709
 also in regional cinemas 

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:46.909
 most certainly the film is on dvd 

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:49.449
 published and then for sale 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.449
 stand 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.840
 i love this dress the dear cattle 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.970
 Steam European motorway is under construction 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.560
 and then the first tower and sees 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.280
 At night of the heart when you know you 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.530
 is back home 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.600
 you can really really quickly from a 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.310
 go to b also in the bike and should 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.570
 more often go out of the subway and 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.740
 walk on foot 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.840
 then you can go through the city very nice 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.850
 We already discovered that here 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.220
 Overall, a cool city is here 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.050
 something is beating and heart beats here 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.520
 That's why I like this city a lot 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.520
 sexy and fascinated
