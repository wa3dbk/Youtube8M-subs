00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 and try to see the screen well that God touched for the others 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.130
 please try to pay close attention so that you understand that if you do 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 something bad is going to have another rival to fear that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.820
 to try again 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.630
 mono annually a problem if you do it wrong but 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.030
 all the attention so that they do it well 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.450
 so 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.580
 well he left them with part 2 that the continuation of the part 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.180
 chéréque 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.610
 please for a lot of tension 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.390
 so 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.690
 once you see the arrow this green arrow 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 you can continue the process 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.809
 it looks like they're going to select here 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.930
 keep going 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.790
 so he says here what I want him to do 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.330
 we proceed to put a check add Syria let's put a check add 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.630
 install 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.790
 i just in case you want 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.610
 can receive a check 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.040
 to this one that says winfrey but wolves that you're only going to choose when the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.399
 poll lighting 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.859
 instead of showing the work apple lagoon the apple that always shows 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:18.930
 he showed a pineapple 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600
 that option so they want to put it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.070
 Now for users in a country with low pacquiao, it will seem like a 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.140
 option that says aside adif or 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.930
 they select so they want to lock their iphone 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.930
 in case it is blocked, there is a selection 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.859
 this part have now is very very very important 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.470
 just like it's very very very complicated too 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 If you fit, pay close attention because we are going to the most important part 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.400
 who to your country because in this position 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.050
 so what are they going 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.900
 the next thing we're going to do 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 before pressing next be ready 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.510
 this process similar to what we had some amount the process very 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.940
 Similary 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.070
 chile that are going to give 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.370
 now he says 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.790
 to make sure that this end of the expo of this connected this process is 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.769
 very important make sure it costs you connected 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.549
 pique must be completely closed too 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.689
 Seneca mojarle next 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.359
 waiting for the thing like r as recovery the first black line 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.459
 when you put the second line pressed on the 'poton' left one by 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.089
 five seconds 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.400
 can see up to khedira and now I squeezed both 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.339
 the button of paul pibe young 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 until it goes to the next line 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.949
 now they can already release when I heard the sound you can release the button 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 of unemployed but keep tight the one of john 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.149
 there you have to be badly followed 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.149
 they keep the pressure on 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.939
 then there are the seconds left to finish now let's review is 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.169
 again when it's on the first black line where it says hollow and there's no 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.309
 Anonymous politician should only wait when the second is put to merit 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.869
 line and as not as the habit was already getting all the information that 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.909
 needs to 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.959
 with sendoa I have released the button left maintains keep it pressed on everything 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 moment 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.329
 when it is in the second black line 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.869
 some of these repeating true what you have to do knows the second 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.219
 Black line should keep the jong button pressed 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.799
 they should begin to prepare it as soon as this second line of the present 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.519
 press the jong button 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.209
 after that one that gave way to the five seconds that was going to happen to 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.319
 the third line and the third line are put in milito 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.029
 once it's the third bold line to keep both pressed 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:41.939
 buttons 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.909
 they the one of the day paid and he left a tip they stopped releasing the one of gomel of 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.760
 john is always going to be pressed only that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.060
 as soon as you move on to the next one you are going to have pressed 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.180
 when the next crime is scheduled after that they are going to release this they were going to 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.789
 keep putting pressure on him 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:01.589
 and then morente basement until here the day still now they are seeing 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.239
 this screen here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.109
 here the screen changed 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.680
 says it's for favors 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.640
 come here the day he says the device ends and good n when 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.689
 you are arese check and you can already release the jong button 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.279
 and wait for this to end 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.809
 gls that poprosa are little complicated but I hope you have not been confused 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.740
 remember the first line says hoping that the epoc was published 

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:27.210
 we open that what blamed the state doing 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.069
 nt immediately put on avoid the second line that starts a count 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.499
 about six seconds 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:35.849
 pressed the button let keep the personal 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.909
 then in the third line it was bold in that without releasing the button 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.219
 johan are going to press the off button 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.029
 once the second thing that was going to happen to the next line ends that 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.870
 it simply means to release the off button 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.660
 but hold down that of jong ecoembes no time they release them and 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.420
 from there 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.420
 just keep the pressure until of milk that once comes Czech 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.420
 you can let go and wait for this to end 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.860
 as you will see it is a more efficient process 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.430
 although a little complicated if in something if by some chance they released the hair 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.360
 by accident they paid him error 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.110
 just go back to try cheap and reset your high keeping 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.699
 tight soto for 10 seconds 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.689
 and good 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.120
 they will have to go back to the albistur and try again remember that it is very 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.110
 important that I never luck that the button left a 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.020
 remember it always 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.680
 that just because the construction was in English I did not just translate for 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.940
 help them if they have a problem if they give any error during 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.029
 the process 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.869
 to say that I'm 100% sure it's because you started or dropped water 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:41.150
 some of the goal buttons pressed at the time it was not 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.490
 they simply have to 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.289
 that if it gives you an error it is simply to maintain pressure supply because 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.860
 seconds and his wife bariera tiar and can try again 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.219
 you do not need to restore just have to reset the baby's reason to try 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.819
 and good here 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.169
 as they were 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.520
 I'm going to process says it seems to have been completed 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.919
 and I know that the devices are ready to use evils then hand 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.979
 let's block it 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.190
 As you will see, it gives me the warning that it is newly restored 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.689
