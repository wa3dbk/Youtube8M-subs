00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.400
 hi all the girls i 'm back from 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.669
 new with another video and this is a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.040
 nail art video 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.349
 he didn't see me because I wanted to say china 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.720
 a beautiful video without a guardian is 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.970
 beautiful because this nail art is me 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.280
 really makes this nail art go crazy and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.160
 because I really like both me very much 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
 both to customers as you have 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.300
 since I posted some photos that 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.360
 they really wanted this done 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 nail art and things close to you too 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.409
 It makes you both things really 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.559
 very simple I could as well a 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.780
 avoid doing it but being pretty 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.210
 and particular maybe for those girls 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.430
 who really don't know how 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.119
 to do it I wanted to do just the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.479
 tutorial 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.460
 however, I send you a big kiss 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.159
 see you later and then after 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.180
 the white we take is catalyzed 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:16.180
 a saucer of paper a base I in 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.969
 this case I use the base of the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.939
 maps and let's put the base of the 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.060
 color of our roses this case 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.789
 I chose this color me soudant and the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.090
 number zero 3 this species of red 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.090
 coral 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.579
 this is our courage or you put 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:46.329
 in abundance because then maybe there is the 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:48.909
 what's left is the ok pink 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.740
 for the moment only these are good 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.770
 two colors because I want to do it with 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.179
 these two then the coral red and the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.719
 rose afterwards with our sport 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.119
 in this case I use a spot a 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.060
 fine tip however also with one 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.340
 small ball what we do for 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 we train the color and go for it 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.569
 stains on long on 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.380
 reconstruction 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:21.900
 we take the color not excessively 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.540
 let's make stains 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 even irregular with a little like things 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.940
 let's say that water is irregular 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:41.320
 see you make the tremble slightly 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:43.660
 fair tip too big and do not 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.430
 neither too small because otherwise 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:54.220
 takes up space I clean the brush on a 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.330
 little paper and now I take the pink one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.330
 increase that type of merola 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 and as well as I do but to pee 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.580
 aggregate with the color now 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.180
 salmon and white I will go to make 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.010
 shades of my roses with the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.799
 finest tip of the spot is what 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.750
 very important since it is there anyway 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.519
 the layer of is in only on the color 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.670
 dispersion boy is very important 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.250
 that we say every flower more or less 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.610
 catalyze because otherwise there is the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.120
 risk that the vignettes expand the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.709
 result is not so beautiful then 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.480
 being that in this case it is only a 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.000
 finger I will have to catalyze every time if 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.010
 make two hands a hand will enter and 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.319
 comes out I can assure you that it looks like one 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.150
 annoyance but then in the end it takes care of us 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.120
 you hurry really veil so 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.290
 very fast you don't lose much time 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.680
 then we wait for the color with the spot 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.959
 then the gel and we make some 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.760
 quotation marks inside the roses 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.590
 I noticed only now that with the background 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 so you couldn't see a bat 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.220
 sorry really I didn't make it 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.310
 I realize that he actually did n't give me the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.260
 right light then we said le 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.210
 We do the same thing now 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.630
 on red maybe you can see it on yours 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:33.110
 better as you can see I do tremble 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.820
 a little now quote and then I do 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.820
 let's say this point in the middle 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:51.229
 even aspiring to the center is a lot 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:58.969
 well if you do some sort of spiral you see 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:58.969
 quote breathe 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:08.419
 ok and they catalyze and with the salmon color 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.979
 I clean the spot with the salmon-colored do 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:16.209
 another shade of red in this 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.249
 case making only external petals 

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:22.009
 I could do it with rose too 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:26.079
 so in this case as you can see 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.729
 you need to have a slightly darker base 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:30.979
 inside we say the petals do it with 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.719
 light color and with a color instead 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.939
 intermediate we go to give one last 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.189
 shade outside to not do 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.099
 right now with shit and leaf 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:44.959
 so we are going to realize precisely the 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:48.499
 leaves two flower petals 2 2 sheets a 

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:50.929
 stress flower test which game of 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.539
 words let's try to put them say 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:58.249
 where more or less if not space 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:01.249
 we do too big because we say the 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:04.899
 the main ones are roses and therefore 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.899
 you should barely see 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:14.329
 ok and catalyze seeing is too much mess 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.929
 I falled in love 

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:20.689
 then girls as you can see is 

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:24.049
 really too cute with gods too 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:26.359
 simple girl gestures and wonderful me 

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:29.239
 really work go crazy for this 

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:32.659
 nail art with a sports pad with a pad 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:34.849
 sorry sorry let's get it off 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.259
 color dispersion layer for the 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.059
 simple fact and this is the very thing 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.429
 important girls for the simple fact 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:43.159
 that as soon as you go to pass the 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.989
 sealant if there is a layer of 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:48.039
 color dispersion of soiling 

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:52.879
 all white then you with a pad 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:55.279
 let's go clean we say ours the 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.589
 our and the art bind all the color 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.889
 nothing happens so much so that 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:02.839
 so when we pass the sealant will not 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.539
 it will stain nothing and the color of the 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.610
 high and now we pass ours 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.709
 sealer the nice thing is that you can 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.469
 do on reconstruction on enamel 

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:17.089
 semipermanent I in this case step 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:20.209
 the top shine you see if I didn't have 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:22.209
 removed the dispersive layer in this 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:24.619
 moment I would have all the basic color 

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:28.579
 stained and the roses were no longer 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:30.679
 so defined but they would all have been 

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:33.709
 drooled all dirty full of 

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:36.129
 strips and no boys then like 

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:38.150
 you could really see 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:40.160
 easy to make 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.810
 make me this nail art 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.210
 to know if you have realized them too 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.420
 let me know if you like let me know 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.740
 if your la is satisfied 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.810
 your curiosity 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.460
 I, as always, do not mimic a very great one 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.460
 peace nor see you at the next video
