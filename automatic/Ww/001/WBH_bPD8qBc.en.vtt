been to 11 total Target stores and I've

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
been to 11 total Target stores and I've
so<00:00:26.550> far<00:00:26.820> found<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.439> 14<00:00:29.099> packs

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so far found this would be 14 packs

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
so far found this would be 14 packs
whole<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.090> they're<00:00:30.240> definitely<00:00:30.449> hard<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> find

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
whole so they're definitely hard to find

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
whole so they're definitely hard to find
not<00:00:31.830> many<00:00:32.070> Target<00:00:32.489> stores<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:33.030> have
