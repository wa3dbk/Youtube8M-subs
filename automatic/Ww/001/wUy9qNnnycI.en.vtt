00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello everyone with you rusalin 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 and we're on a video channel devoted to modeling from 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 Today's polymer clay master 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 class we will do amazing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.080
 hairpin with flowers 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.150
 moorea flowers of this plant come in a moment 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 recipe elixir of life for Egyptian 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.670
 pharaohs 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.539
 for work we need polymer 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 white clay and light green 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.840
 quick-drying glue stamen blade 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.309
 all kinds of junction 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 liquid plastic brush scissors base 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.550
 for hairpins and rolling pin or machine posts 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 we stretch our hands white clay and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.059
 form 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 a little bit wide 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.030
 pieces of droplets we 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.980
 with a needle we make a recess exactly on 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.780
 half of our to take manicure 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.170
 scissors insert into this hole and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.530
 we cut a droplet into five equal parts 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.659
 take the stack with the ball and pull each 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.760
 petal work while you need 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.540
 glove not to leave 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.659
 no prints and no blur white 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.659
 clay 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.430
 each of the leaves 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.140
 I twist and pinch my fingers 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.580
 petal ends 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.580
 get 5 forest flower 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 ball joints I go deep into the heart 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.229
 I pull the reverse side of col. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.479
 besides flowers 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 we will need to form more and semi 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.790
 closed bud for this form 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 just a bit smaller already and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 from the wide side cut 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.250
 scissors her into four equal parts 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 then we press these notched parts 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.630
 each other and get a closed bud 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.200
 for the hairpin I made 13 flowers 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 white and 8 buds now flowers and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.360
 the buds we send the spirit gun on common 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.849
 we need and light green polymer clay 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.950
 make the basis for hairpins we 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.079
 prepare a layer of lime them 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.250
 roll out and at the post machine thickness 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.040
 about one and a half millimeters 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.959
 We put the base for hairpins and 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.890
 according to the contours of our base we 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.530
 cut out the blank from plastic 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.190
 then we take it and press it tight 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.660
 this layer of lime clay 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.940
 metal flat area of ​​our 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.819
 the base then take a liquid polymer 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:15.329
 clay and abundant and applied over 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.329
 lettuce 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.850
 pinch off a piece of lime clay 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.250
 we form a small ball out of it 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.930
 a stack of balls we make a dimple in 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.700
 this light green balls 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.450
 now we take liquid polymer clay 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.690
 coat the tip of the closed bud 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.410
 and at the missed tip of the bud we 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.020
 we put on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.050
 this salad hat would be a sepal 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.330
 flowers and buds now we fix the buds 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.460
 on the basis of hairpins exactly the same 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.220
 actions we will do with all the buds 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.110
 and with all the flowers we coat the sharp 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.470
 end 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.470
 bud or flower strung on sharp 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.520
 edge lettuce hat and fasten our 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.380
 blanks are already on the lime base 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.040
 as our fantasy tells us 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.220
 since we have baked flowers we can 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.980
 Do not be afraid that they will be damaged and at the same 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.109
 time we can shoot them surfaces 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.540
 if suddenly we don't like the accommodation 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.260
 some flowers or buds on 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.669
 surfaces we can press them tight 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.110
 to the base to press into it at all 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.890
 place flowers on the base 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.690
 or see it filled 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.240
 if between colors there is somewhere 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.640
 the gaps can be filled with buds 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.980
 flowers moorea chinese tender air 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.680
 the hairpin turns out so light and fresh 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.750
 it is a pity that plastic does not convey flavors 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.180
 if the producer heard us and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.810
 created plastic with the scent of flowers was 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.810
 would be wonderful 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.110
 model 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.950
 Now I take liquid polymer clay 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.590
 I have it different is very thick I 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.280
 I use babbit plastic in this 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.100
 case 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.740
 sometimes liquid when trying to shop 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:23.400
 I am now putting thick inside the flower 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.360
 then i take the stamens prune them 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.010
 customize to fit me and 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.390
 putting drowning in this liquid polymer 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.340
 3 it is not so thick that the stamens are not 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.740
 fall apart in different directions 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.440
 and stand upright as I them 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.750
 put a reference to where you can 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.120
 I will leave to get stamens 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.820
 video please before asking no 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.190
 question where what was bought look 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.470
 under the video I leave a lot of links 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.430
 especially for you shop in which I 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:00.720
 I acquire stamens do not sell Chinese 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:04.380
 stamen production from japan and and thailand 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.920
 very high quality not painted water not 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.920
 to be afraid 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.920
 here is a hairpin fully decorated 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:47.260
 flowers stamens and buds and now we 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.340
 we can put it on the oven already 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.930
 after firing, we will need to disconnect 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.710
 billet from the metal base 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:59.560
 lavish with quick-drying glue 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:02.100
 plastic base attach 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.900
 metal base hairpins 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.250
 come this whole thing and give it to him 

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.220
 dry out well 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.250
 hairpin with flowers moore i'm ready this 

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.780
 amazing tender and touching 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.890
 barrette that will not leave anyone 

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.320
 indifferent 

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.880
 with you there was a rusalin and until new meetings 

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.880
 all on my video channel bye
