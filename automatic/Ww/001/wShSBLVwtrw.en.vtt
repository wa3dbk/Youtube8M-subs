the dampness of the sponge kind of makes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.929 
the dampness of the sponge kind of makes
it<00:01:54.000> feel<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:54.810> lighter<00:01:55.079> weight

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
it feel a little bit lighter weight

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.190 
it feel a little bit lighter weight
sometimes<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.149> you're<00:01:57.299> using<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.750> brush<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
sometimes when you're using a brush it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
can feel really thick and heavy and this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.620 
can feel really thick and heavy and this
will<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.659> help<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.290> streak<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> much<00:02:02.630> as

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
will also help but not streak as much as

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.550 
will also help but not streak as much as
far<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.799> tell<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.280> far<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:07.079> love<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
far as I can tell so far and I love the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.340

finish<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
finish of this

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.830 
finish of this
nation<00:02:08.710> it's<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:09.400> lightweight<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.210> I'm

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
nation it's so lightweight and I'm

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.390 
nation it's so lightweight and I'm
really<00:02:11.080> even<00:02:11.470> out<00:02:11.590> my<00:02:11.620> skin<00:02:11.770> tone<00:02:12.220> without

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
really even out my skin tone without

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.930 
really even out my skin tone without
feeling<00:02:12.910> cakey<00:02:13.150> or<00:02:13.300> heavy<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:15.130> think<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.760> will

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
feeling cakey or heavy so I think I will

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.360 
feeling cakey or heavy so I think I will
probably<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.780> repurchasing<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:17.770> once<00:02:18.220> I've

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
probably be repurchasing this once I've

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.970 
probably be repurchasing this once I've
run<00:02:18.550> out<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.940> sample<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.740> color

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
run out of this sample and the color

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.240 
run out of this sample and the color
matches<00:02:21.520> very<00:02:22.060> well<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.710> I'm<00:02:23.710> gonna<00:02:23.860> put<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.130> a

as far as the Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.910> love<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.390> finish<00:04:48.690> side<00:04:48.870> of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
foundation I love the finish side of

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.040 
foundation I love the finish side of
game<00:04:49.280> it's<00:04:50.280> very<00:04:50.370> light<00:04:50.910> weight<00:04:50.940> feeling<00:04:51.630> but

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
game it's very light weight feeling but

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.840 
game it's very light weight feeling but
it's<00:04:52.200> still<00:04:52.380> even<00:04:52.860> out<00:04:52.950> my<00:04:52.980> skin<00:04:53.100> tone<00:04:53.550> very

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
it's still even out my skin tone very

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.180 
it's still even out my skin tone very
well<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:55.350> kind<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.560> like<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.830> natural

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
well and it's kind of like a natural

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.580 
well and it's kind of like a natural
slightly<00:04:57.030> matte<00:04:57.300> finish<00:04:57.720> it's<00:04:57.930> not<00:04:58.110> too<00:04:58.380> dewy

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
slightly matte finish it's not too dewy

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.500 
slightly matte finish it's not too dewy
and<00:04:58.920> it's<00:04:59.040> not<00:04:59.190> too<00:04:59.430> dry<00:04:59.580> looking<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.090> my<00:05:00.210> skin

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
and it's not too dry looking on my skin

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.780 
and it's not too dry looking on my skin
so<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.720> think<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.050> would<00:05:01.140> work<00:05:01.460> from<00:05:02.460> anywhere

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
so I think it would work from anywhere

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.330 
so I think it would work from anywhere
from<00:05:02.850> normal<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.450> skin<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.990> oily<00:05:04.590> skin<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:05.130> don't

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
from normal to skin to oily skin I don't

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.070 
from normal to skin to oily skin I don't
know<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.820> dry<00:05:06.060> skin<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.480> this<00:05:06.540> would<00:05:06.750> be<00:05:06.870> too

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
know if dry skin and this would be too

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.240 
know if dry skin and this would be too
dry<00:05:08.360> but<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.390> love<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.020> way<00:05:10.140> it<00:05:10.290> looks<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.800> most

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
dry but I love the way it looks and most

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.950 
dry but I love the way it looks and most
importantly<00:05:11.730> it<00:05:11.970> feels<00:05:12.270> lightweight<00:05:12.570> and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
importantly it feels lightweight and

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.210 
importantly it feels lightweight and
doesn't<00:05:13.320> feel<00:05:13.530> like<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.770> have<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:13.980> lot<00:05:14.160> of

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
doesn't feel like I have a lot of

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.520 
doesn't feel like I have a lot of
foundation<00:05:14.730> on<00:05:14.790> which<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.270> really<00:05:15.540> like<00:05:15.720> okay

definitely<00:05:28.800> think<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.610> worth<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.390> if<00:05:31.140> I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
definitely think it's worth it and if I

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.590

it
I<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:44.010> tried<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.550> little<00:05:44.700> disposable
