 adha i have in 3 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.359
 all it is at the fence but the experienced 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.259
 was strong again for a few years 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.289
 that became a mess on Tuesday 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 a pair of shoes 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.639
 there is a stronghold 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.430
 how so 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.759
 we believe what you always wanted 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.690
 they are on the part with his going to sail at sea now it is already his goal 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:42.710
 achieved 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.879
 but yes you can say the municipality 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.319
 my tent is top of the district 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.559
 and it is said to be the most intimate circle i am good enough to not be left behind 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.819
 to stay 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.819
 he just comes home again 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.460
 not to lose 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.189
 i'm sorry i'd just walked away 10 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.509
 I would have liked to say goodbye to him because there is no time left for it 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:16.779
 lucius conditions that no one but such a weird has gone to the doctors i 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.439
 hadn't discovered a bit less back then foundation surprisingly 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.439
 I didn't have to do anything 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.539
 the debate is assumed 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.169
 secretly he was not on board the largest sailing ship of in the night 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.709
 Bass town crept because they don't normally query the sea 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.449
 in the end, his dream came true 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.249
 to experience an adventure 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.909
 Of course the first desire was to find a fire that was pathetic 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.879
 small speaking people who met on the shore to get the mart smeets in the bath 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.740
 to profile 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
