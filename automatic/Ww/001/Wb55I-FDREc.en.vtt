it has a unidirectional rotating bezel

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.020 
it has a unidirectional rotating bezel
so<00:01:46.350> divers<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.980> gauge<00:01:47.190> their<00:01:47.430> airtime<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so divers can gauge their airtime and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.640 
so divers can gauge their airtime and
since<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.870> only<00:01:48.960> rotates<00:01:49.440> counterclockwise

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
since it only rotates counterclockwise

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.100 
since it only rotates counterclockwise
the<00:01:50.580> time<00:01:50.760> can<00:01:50.970> only<00:01:51.150> become<00:01:51.360> shorter<00:01:51.870> not

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the time can only become shorter not

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.320 
the time can only become shorter not
longer<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.310> less<00:01:53.520> danger<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.000> divers

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
longer so there is less danger of divers
