 characteristic features are its claws 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 adamantium that were the product of 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.250
 undergo a clandestine project to 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.129
 create perfect combat weapons but 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.410
 that we know so much about this subject and how 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.040
 here the comics are our fascination 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.370
 and to complement what we talk about x 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:48.200
 23 in a previous video that's why 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:52.010
 world comics presents you project weapon x 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.060
 but before that project arms x the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.270
 project weapon xo weapon x was a 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.070
 secret and clandestine entrepreneurship 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.010

 concealed within the ministry of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.540
 defense of the Canadian government if the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.810
 Canadians also have their secrets 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.970

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.940
 improved captain america for it 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.509
 Various experiments were carried out in 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.540
 human beings being many of them 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:40.220
 mutants you mutated artificially in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.250
 the 1960s weapon x produced agents 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.590
 mentally programmed as place that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 virtue and now that we talk about 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.310
 project members who have 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.740
 been used as part of these 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.490
 experiments 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.240

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.680
 implanted false memories he managed 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.390
 escape and was considered a fugitive but 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.230
 as we all know he joined the exams 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.260
 contracted cancer way was submitted a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.990
 experiment where they incorporated the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.150
 healing power to come back and this caused 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.820
 that his cancer heal itself but that everything 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.160
 his body was deformed from 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.440
 from that moment he put on his red suit 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.140
 and started his solo career as 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 assassin affair wey is a very character 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.310
 fickle and is the antihero stereotype 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.840
 copycat his first appearance was in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.450
 new mutants 98 in February of 1991 it 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.700
 infiltrated the project weapon x in order 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 to destroy but to take care of the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.680
 team members forgotten their mission 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.230
 in this project they were increased in a way 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.870
 synthetic his mutant powers of 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.690
 mimicry to be a spy 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.840
 perfect 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.440
 silver fox his first appearance was 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.910
 return and volume 2 number days in August 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.680
 of 1989 he was loving to come back and he was made 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.050
 team member x though 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.490
 later he betrayed them and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.870
 became a member of aira 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:41.460
 x 23 Laura has her first appearance 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.120
 it was in comics in volume 1 number 3 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.580
 February 2004 is a clone to come back 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.370
 and that she was born as a woman because she shows 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.980
 genetic was incomplete and to be 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.530
 honest they improved it because like all 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.420
 we know women are better than 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 men this in real life but 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.030
 also in the comics besides that for 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.390
 many fans see a superhero with 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.770
 Breasts is something that they love 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.410
 coming back to the point as we said 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.750
 previously because the incomplete 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.850
 genetic code to come back and part was used 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.900
 of the genetic code of Dr. Sara 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.790
 keene and now well x 23 or claws in 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.270
 feet and hands covered with adamantium 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.440
 especially his first appearance was in 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.750
 iron fist volume 1 number 14 in august 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.640
 from 1977 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.430
 This is a mutant that has some 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.080
 physical abilities over human 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.970
 mixed with those of a beast whose 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.160
 most notable are the time of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.800
 superior recovery and very senses 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.470
 sharpened is a mutant with tendencies 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.660
 murderers and sociopaths think if 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.550
 joined the project so that it is not 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.650
 forget your dark past 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.620
 the origin of hatred between knows everything and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.920
 come back and it is born when it kills silver 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.780
 fox and now that we knew a little more 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.780
 about this project that he developed 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.900
 amazing mutants besides heroes 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.390
 or memorable villains what do you think of what 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.510
 you think it will be the greatest virtue of the place 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.900
 for me the most surprising thing is that who 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.190
 They are behind all this are the 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.340
 disturbing and terrifying 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.830
 Canadians or by God all can be 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.040
 bad in comics already as the last 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.849
 question for you make a list of minor 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.729
