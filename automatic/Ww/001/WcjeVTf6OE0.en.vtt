00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
the new turbo era about to dawn in

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.130 
the new turbo era about to dawn in
Formula<00:00:26.619> one<00:00:26.740> next<00:00:26.980> year<00:00:27.329> how<00:00:28.329> you<00:00:28.390> expect<00:00:29.020> the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
Formula one next year how you expect the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.050 
Formula one next year how you expect the
pecking<00:00:29.500> order<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.890> change<00:00:30.160> next<00:00:30.429> year<00:00:30.580> and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
pecking order to change next year and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.189 
pecking order to change next year and
what<00:00:31.720> will<00:00:31.869> be<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.259> it<00:00:32.379> for<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.680> fans<00:00:32.949> I<00:00:34.199> think

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
what will be in it for the fans I think

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.070 
what will be in it for the fans I think
that<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.860> pecking<00:00:36.220> order<00:00:36.519> is<00:00:36.580> is<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.570> very

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
that the pecking order is is a very

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.939 
that the pecking order is is a very
difficult<00:00:38.379> one<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.570> could<00:00:40.870> well<00:00:41.170> be<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:41.500> one

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
difficult one it could well be that one

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.890 
difficult one it could well be that one
of<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.220> three<00:00:42.370> engine<00:00:42.760> manufacturers<00:00:43.480> get

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
of the three engine manufacturers get

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.750 
of the three engine manufacturers get
significant<00:00:44.589> advantage<00:00:45.070> over<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.400> other<00:00:45.579> two

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
significant advantage over the other two

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.070 
significant advantage over the other two
at<00:00:46.420> which<00:00:46.570> point<00:00:46.900> you<00:00:47.260> may<00:00:47.979> get<00:00:48.190> more<00:00:48.640> of<00:00:48.790> the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
at which point you may get more of the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.930 
at which point you may get more of the
grid<00:00:50.080> more<00:00:50.260> by<00:00:50.470> engine<00:00:50.799> manufacturer<00:00:51.489> than<00:00:51.670> by

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
grid more by engine manufacturer than by

grid more by engine manufacturer than by
the<00:00:52.239> chassis<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.860> just<00:00:54.040> don't<00:00:54.250> know<00:00:54.400> whether

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
the chassis we just don't know whether

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.160 
the chassis we just don't know whether
what<00:00:55.330> will<00:00:55.479> happen<00:00:55.750> because<00:00:55.809> obviously

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
what will happen because obviously

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.820 
what will happen because obviously
everything's<00:00:56.650> done<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.890> complete<00:00:57.159> security

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
everything's done the complete security

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.710 
everything's done the complete security
and<00:00:59.830> it's<00:01:00.040> not<00:01:00.189> only<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.760> engine<00:01:00.909> regulations

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
and it's not only the engine regulations

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.660 
and it's not only the engine regulations
is<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.049> big<00:01:02.229> change<00:01:02.439> next<00:01:02.860> year<00:01:03.010> we've<00:01:03.460> also

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
is the big change next year we've also

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.950 
is the big change next year we've also
got<00:01:04.479> some<00:01:05.100> significant<00:01:06.270> irezumi<00:01:07.270> regulations

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
got some significant irezumi regulations

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.410 
got some significant irezumi regulations
changes<00:01:08.920> one<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.580> due<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> engine

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
changes one is due to the engine

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.859 
changes one is due to the engine
effectively<00:01:10.990> which<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.640> engines<00:01:12.970> require

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
effectively which is the engines require

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.510 
effectively which is the engines require
a<00:01:14.080> massive<00:01:14.470> amount<00:01:14.650> of<00:01:14.799> buildings<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
a massive amount of buildings the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.510 
a massive amount of buildings the
interpreters<00:01:16.330> got<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> charge<00:01:17.320> ethical<00:01:17.799> but

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
interpreters got the charge ethical but

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.490 
interpreters got the charge ethical but
there's<00:01:18.700> also<00:01:18.850> much<00:01:19.180> bigger<00:01:19.450> electrical<00:01:20.020> kind

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
there's also much bigger electrical kind

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.250 
there's also much bigger electrical kind
of<00:01:20.590> content<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:22.360> can<00:01:22.510> also<00:01:22.630> fit<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.900> mobile

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
of content so it can also fit the mobile

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.420 
of content so it can also fit the mobile
radiator<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.830> be<00:01:23.920> honest<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.190> narrow

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
radiator to be honest then got a narrow

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.670 
radiator to be honest then got a narrow
front<00:01:27.730> wing<00:01:28.000> much<00:01:28.690> higher<00:01:28.930> weight<00:01:29.200> which<00:01:29.409> puts

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
front wing much higher weight which puts

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.170 
front wing much higher weight which puts
different<00:01:30.190> stresses<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.760> tiles<00:01:31.090> of

the chassis so lots of changes how that
affects<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> competitive<00:01:45.940> order<00:01:46.270> and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
to be seen it seems likely the grid will

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.719 
to be seen it seems likely the grid will
be<00:01:55.659> less<00:01:55.840> tight<00:01:56.110> because<00:01:56.770> that's<00:01:57.340> what<00:01:57.520> tends

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
be less tight because that's what tends

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.160 
be less tight because that's what tends
to<00:01:57.820> happen<00:01:57.909> when<00:01:58.210> there's<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.450> big<00:01:58.600> regulation

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
that the races themselves are very much
