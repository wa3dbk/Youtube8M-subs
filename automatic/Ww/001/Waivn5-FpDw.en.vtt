00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this is our hard part take that and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.060 
this is our hard part take that and
twist<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> messes<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
twist that will that kind of messes you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.149 
twist that will that kind of messes you
up<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> first<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:30.110> but<00:01:31.110> you'll<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
up at the first time but you'll get it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.090 
up at the first time but you'll get it
later<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.729> okay<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.020> overlap<00:01:34.619> everything

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
later on okay so you overlap everything

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
later on okay so you overlap everything
do<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> technically<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> 3d<00:01:39.180> star

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
do that you technically have the 3d star

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.499 
do that you technically have the 3d star
it<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.890> doesn't<00:01:41.159> look<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it it doesn't look like it you have to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
it it doesn't look like it you have to
adjust<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.439> fingers<00:01:43.740> see

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
adjust it with your other fingers see

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.859 
adjust it with your other fingers see
there's<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:44.970> gap<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.710> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.799> 3d<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
there's a little gap there kind of 3d I

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:57.230 
there's a little gap there kind of 3d I
don't<00:01:49.250> okay<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.860> triple<00:01:53.579> star<00:01:56.240> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
don't okay now to do the triple star and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.039 
don't okay now to do the triple star and
easier<00:01:58.049> we're<00:01:59.210> hope<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.509> rubber<00:02:00.899> band

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
easier we're hope this rubber band

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.100 
easier we're hope this rubber band
doesn't<00:02:01.350> break<00:02:03.829> okay<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.450> do<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
doesn't break okay so you do that do you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
doesn't break okay so you do that do you
instead<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:09.090> underneath

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
instead of going in here go underneath

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.790 
instead of going in here go underneath
it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.850 
it
underneath<00:02:12.790> hurts<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:17.080> do<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.620> same

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
underneath hurts then you do the same

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.360 
underneath hurts then you do the same
thing<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:19.180> everything<00:02:19.390> else<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.130> still

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
thing for everything else and you still

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.180 
thing for everything else and you still
have<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.200> only<00:02:23.350> difference<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.920> they

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
have it but the only difference is they

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.950 
have it but the only difference is they
have<00:02:24.400> these<00:02:24.550> circles<00:02:25.060> around<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.450> that's<00:02:25.720> it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
have these circles around it that's it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.220 
have these circles around it that's it
but<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:27.130> still<00:02:27.430> has<00:02:27.760> 3d<00:02:28.120> stars<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.660> mean

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
but it's it still has 3d stars I mean

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
but it's it still has 3d stars I mean
three<00:02:29.920> three<00:02:30.550> stars<00:02:31.590> okay<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.580> was<00:02:33.730> it
