get tired of it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.979 
get tired of it
and<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:46.520> laser<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.969> best<00:00:47.180> way<00:00:47.360> don't<00:00:47.690> do

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
and the laser is the best way don't do

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.410 
and the laser is the best way don't do
take<00:00:48.260> care<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:49.610> creates<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.059> thermal

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
take care of it it creates a thermal

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.160 
take care of it it creates a thermal
reaction<00:00:50.690> heat<00:00:51.309> when<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.399> chose<00:00:52.640> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
reaction heat when you chose and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.580 
reaction heat when you chose and
basically<00:00:54.170> kills<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.059> fungal<00:00:56.059> elements<00:00:56.590> so

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
basically kills the fungal elements so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.219 
basically kills the fungal elements so
