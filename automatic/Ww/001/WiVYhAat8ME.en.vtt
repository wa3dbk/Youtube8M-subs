custom-made<00:00:57.140> map<00:00:57.560> so<00:00:57.950> I'm<00:00:58.670> actually<00:00:58.820> getting

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
custom-made map so I'm actually getting

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.670 
custom-made map so I'm actually getting
a<00:00:59.270> bit<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.900> a<00:01:00.020> lag<00:01:00.200> here<00:01:01.930> other<00:01:02.930> than<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.290> it's

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
a bit of a lag here other than that it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.219 
a bit of a lag here other than that it's
amazing<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.150> map<00:01:05.360> has<00:01:05.659> three<00:01:06.229> ships<00:01:08.229> one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
okay there we go so I think this is the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.899 
okay there we go so I think this is the
medium<00:01:17.960> one<00:01:18.200> I'm<00:01:18.440> not<00:01:18.590> sure<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.670> big

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460

I<00:01:50.869> think<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.979> with<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.090> map<00:01:53.330> but<00:01:53.900> it's

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
I think you can with this map but it's

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.130 
I think you can with this map but it's
really<00:01:54.229> detailed<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.920> like<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:56.240> how<00:01:56.900> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140

looks<00:01:57.880> so<00:02:00.040> let's<00:02:01.040> see<00:02:01.220> this<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.700> actually<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> I

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
looks so let's see this is actually a I

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.700 
looks so let's see this is actually a I
think<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.070> small<00:02:04.460> boat<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:06.229> first<00:02:06.500> one

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
think this is a small boat the first one

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.170 
think this is a small boat the first one
we<00:02:06.860> saw<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.189> was<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.369> medium<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.819> thought

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
we saw it was a medium and that thought

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.020 
we saw it was a medium and that thought
was<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.569> big<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.220> last<00:02:13.400> one<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.760> think

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
was a big and then the last one I think

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.870 
was a big and then the last one I think
it's<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.659> a<00:02:14.780> small<00:02:15.319> or<00:02:15.590> medium
