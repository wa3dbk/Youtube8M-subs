 are well dissolved 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.130
 and then add half a teaspoon of 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.500

 you're ready to use it 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.630
 Now in a wok at high heat you go to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.439
 mixed with half teaspoon of oil 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.210
 of sesame you want the oil to be 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 hot before you start cooking 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.649
 the rest of the ingredients so 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 let it warm up really well 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.260
 since the oil is hot 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.819
 now you are going to cook the chicken make sure 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 that chicken is well spread in 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.060
 the wok in a single layer and cook it to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 fire high for 3 minutes do not stir it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.620
 very much let it cook on the one hand 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.599
 for about a minute and then 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.900
 of the minute now yes you stir it for 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.430
 that is to adore the other side and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
 As I tell you, you are only going to cook it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.090
 for 3 minutes on high heat after 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.859
 three minutes 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.139
 the chicken should have a little bit of color 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.720
 everywhere but there will still be a 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.519
 little bit raw inside this is 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.769
 perfectly fine because it is finished 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.870
 cook later if you let the chicken 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.790
 cook completely right now 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.280
 finish the dish the chicken will be 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.230
 something dry so do not worry 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.230
 only cook it for three minutes 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.480
 although we stay raw because the chicken 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.159
 It has taken a little color as 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.010
 have lost that pink color that is 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.139
 characteristic of raw meat you're going 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.550
 to withdraw from the fire and reserves it for a 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.160
 moment 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.190
 in the same wok you're going to heat a 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.140
 tablespoon and a half more of vegetable oil 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.070
 and now you're going to cook the onion for a 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.230
 minute 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.850
 stirring constantly and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.690
 It is only a minute to be 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.690
 begin to soften 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 after a minute add the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.709
 peppers and stirring cooking 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.110
 the for about two more minutes 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.330
 I like that my vegetables are left 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.640
 crispy so I 'm just 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.680
 cooking for a very short time if you 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.379
 you want them more soft you can 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.379
 cook them for three to four minutes more 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.650
 after two minutes and the vegetables 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.090
 they have the consistency that I like 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.370
 after two minutes add the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.069
 peanuts and skips everything together for about 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.440
 30 more seconds for the peanuts 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.010
 begin to release some of the oil that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.010
 there is in them 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.200
 and after 30 seconds go up 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.720
 ingredients on the sides of the wok to 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.300
 that you have an empty space in the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.790
 center of the wok and there in that space 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.890
 empty right in the center of the wok you go to 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.100
 add chopped garlic and ginger 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.100
 grated 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.430
 Skip this with the rest of the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.860
 ingredients for another 30 seconds more 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.290
 only for garlic and ginger 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.290
 begin to release their scent 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.410
 then add the dried chilies and 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.860
 continue leaving this for 30 seconds 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.860
 plus 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.680
 after 30 seconds now yes we are going to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.990
 return the chicken to the wok with the rest of 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.390
 the vegetables and on the chicken we are going to 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.390
 add the soy sauce mixture 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.270
 and also add 2 tablespoons of 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.980
 hoisin sauce saute all together 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.290
 taste and add salt or 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.389
 pepper if you think it necessary if the 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.310
 shared sauce was very thick 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.490
 you can add one or two tablespoons 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.860
 more than water or you can also add 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.530
 two tablespoons of chicken broth or if 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.139
 you prefer you can add a spoonful 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.870
 of soy sauce I think mine already 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.000
 it's perfect just like this is how I'm going to 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.340
 leave there are people who like that the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.430
 sauce is more liquid to me I like 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.440
 just as it is that the sauce is only 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.780
 to cover the ingredients you can not see 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.480
 liquid or thick 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.820
 then as I tell you and my company is 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.000
 ready if you like you can add 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.700
 a little more liquid and that's it 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.540
 let's skip this for two more minutes 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.820
 for the chicken to finish sewing 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.040
 and since the chicken is ready now if it 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.780
 they can serve and that's what it looks like in 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.090
 true that it smelled so good 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.400
 delicious, I'll serve it with a little 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.670
 of white rice and that's all good 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.670
