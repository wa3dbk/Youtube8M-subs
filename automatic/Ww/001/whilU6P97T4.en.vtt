00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.410
 hello to everyone as always welcome in 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.200
 pupa nail academy this is the nail art 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.970
 that I propose today to make it happen 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.430
 used one of the newest roofs of the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.730
 linea luxury france is a kit that 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.079
 it consists of a matt enamel and one 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.450
 enamel mirror effect that indeed 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.980
 that is called mirror nail polish 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.559
 what you in particular at 0 3 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.570
 that is beautiful green is malcuit 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.550
 also come the guidelines or bezel 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.850
 eventyr you want to make 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.070
 french manicure or the classic ones 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.420
 in short, lateral diagonals to that then 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.750
 if you prefer 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 I, however, have decided to carry out let's say 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.650
 we want to call it a lateral french 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 a bit special as I have 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.570
 used the stripping and you will see later 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.729
 in the tutorial how you use it for 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.530
 create this effect yes kit yes 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.450
 they can realize so many in the art 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.579
 and also in a simple way as precisely 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 this video will be an example in 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.180
 how much you can play anyway with 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.170
 this contrast between the mad color the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.420
 metallic color and as further 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.510
 effect can always be applied over a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.760
 top coat and then make the matt polish 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.130
 polished and then we will create the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.260
 contrast between a shiny color and a 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.500
 truly luxury metallic color 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.010
 france are kits that leave their own 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.110
 free will to fantasy anyway 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.930
 I stop talking I leave you to the tutorial 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.290
 if it can interest you and I send you a 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 big kiss 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.740
 Hello 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.679
 the first thing to do is to lay the base 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.679
 activates growth on all my nails 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.849
 then I take the kit for the line 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.840
 luxury france and in particular take 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.090
 003 just started spreading the mirror 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:28.049
 nail polish cunico enamel in the bottle 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:30.379
 only on the nail null area do they know instead 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.030
 the crazy nail polish on all the other nails 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.860
 and I'll go and apply two passes for 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.220
 make it completely homogeneous e 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.220
 coherent 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:03:03.810
 then I take the nose stripping n 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 from the many strips that I then go to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 apply on helping me also one 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.140
 tweezers if necessary 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.209
 the way you see I think here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:32.700
 images render more than any 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:34.260
 description here and I show you that on 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.209
 applied only one finger of nietta 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.670
 transversal while on the other fingers 2 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.530
 I then take a downhill cup sponge 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.900
 I begin with the mirror enamel in vivo la 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.590
 sponge and begins to dab on 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.590
 streaming 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.659
 and obviously met on the nail 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.260
 metallized I will always apply 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.940
 with the effect taken by enamel but me 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.500
 here to remove them I waited for it 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.140
 enamel was dry 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.690
 however, he knows equally well that he is doing 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.100
 nail for nail then dabbing it 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.270
 nail polish and then going immediately to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.740
 remove the stream to clean the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.190
 skin around the cuticles we can 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.360
 intervene with the pen correct nail polish 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.680
 with these all i hope is a 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.010
 mobile we go to the next video 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.010
