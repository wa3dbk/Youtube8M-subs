00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.510
 with a latex sponge apply the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.510
 base all over the face 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.070
 let's say it's perfect for one night 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 christmas 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 then right this is the 0-3 in salt that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.150
 I will correct the imperfections that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.500
 on the entire mobile eyelid the application 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.170
 for and more if we have a party we are going to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.360
 dance or as in this case is doing 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.620
 a tremendous and good heat after going 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.870
 to get that men the same 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.300
 much the same de facto palette 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.390
 tap traffics intervene landon this is 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.600
 the 005 speeding I will use the color 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.720
 golden with a diffused brush this is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.410
 the cost of 6 250 you can apply 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.410
 these shadows 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.010
 these shadows / that gives you a 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.520
 luminosity in the eyes for the chips 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.680
 more emphasis on the inner part of with 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.900
 a shadow colored wine this is the law of 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.010
 link to study 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.620
 05 is very pretty and with the same brush 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.100
 blurred I start applying it with 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.100
 circular movements 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 in the external part of the most advanced 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.150
 until you get more or less in half 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.150
 with another clean brush 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.200
 with a brush that ends in points and 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.570
 like this and a brown shadow 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 dark of the explorer palette of Medellin 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.100
 in chanlatte apply it in the crease of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.100
 eye 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.980
 and here at the end 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.980
 it's a way of seeing 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 this is going to give much more depth to 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.640
 the look and obviously the makeup 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 official blur that we are before 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 Blur that brown shadow and take it more 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.260
 inward 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 with a shadow brush is the mac 239 and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.620
 the hard shadow repeats the steps in the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.620
 part below the eye 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.890
 and then with the vinotinto 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 capital 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.180
 no hen touch the brown of the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.340
 outside corner 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.989
 a shadow champ eyed peas de maybelline 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.230
 and with a diffuse brush 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.000
 Apply it right on the lacrimal to give it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.950
 a lot of light to look with a pencil 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.019
 eyeliner with breakers in x line al 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.790
 water line line theme with 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.400
 letter 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 with your eyeliner in the black and a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.590
 Angular brush line lashes 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.659
 from the top on the outside remember 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.290
 delineate the lacrimal because only 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.390
 we want light light light and light now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.670
 just laughs from the eyelashes and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.810
 apply in several layers of black mascara 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.159
 in the tabs above the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.470
 tabs below 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.790
 I'm going to use the mascara rules 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.650
 maybelline 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.909
 It makes me look like eyelashes not me 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.980

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.349

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.639

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.990
 angular brush I apply it well the report 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.160

 we corrected your corrector in 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.970
 class page 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.990
 look with the brush but you can 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.680
 look 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.810
 more comfortable with the filmin powder 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.810
 maybelline this is the medium 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 and now with the middle rumor of picnic of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.010
 maybelline also 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.910
 the brightness I'm going to apply the revolcÃ³n 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.910
 burst in guys 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.740
 yes 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:38.590
 first section to your hair bothers me in 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.600
 the leftover section with a chocolate 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.680
 as the extraordinary to protect from 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.440
 those of the heat 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.260
 grabs the first section of hair and very 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 thick ingada with your iron to smooth 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.020
 hair 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.020
 lizando it slowly begins 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.430
 root and when you go more or less the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.940
 half hair 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.940
 turn it around 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.560
 i 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.889
 that's going to generate a loop that looks like 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.080
 I'm very tight to me it seems to me that 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:20.899
 as I'm just going to iron the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.199
 little bit fast and when you're done 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:26.839
 with the first part we close from the 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.360
 tickets and the rest we take it up 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.449
 so that it does not bother you applied more perfect 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.749
 to give away I'm doing spaces from 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.749
 above 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.430
 I'm staying with the super loose band of 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.890
 patrons 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.390
 once it has stayed that way with the waves 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:53.850
 super loose and very cute we are going to 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.850
 affect us the last part and we do 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:06.040
 and with the last monthly and 40 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.660
 but this one if he grabbed him more from the 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:13.110
 point and I do the curl 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.360
 so that I stay a lot more 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.360
 loose well organized hair 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.950
 so you would then see loose waves 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.630
 for Christmas and New Year 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.520
