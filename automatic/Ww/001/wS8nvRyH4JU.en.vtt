more<00:01:03.120> improvements<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.610> let's<00:01:05.610> join

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
more improvements to it and let's join

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.600 
more improvements to it and let's join
here<00:01:06.509> basically<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> whole<00:01:08.580> thing

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
here basically you put the whole thing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
here basically you put the whole thing
in<00:01:08.940> one<00:01:09.119> piece<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.810> piece<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.770> piece<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
in one piece this piece this piece can

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.530 
in one piece this piece this piece can
be<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.549> piece<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> tax<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.299> peace

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
be one piece it was a tax just for peace

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
be one piece it was a tax just for peace
around<00:01:15.690> here<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.740> only<00:01:16.890> join<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:18.030> be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
around here and the only join will be

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
around here and the only join will be
that<00:01:18.540> piece<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.490> I'd

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that piece here also in the back I'd

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.289 
that piece here also in the back I'd
notice<00:01:22.399> instead<00:01:23.399> of<00:01:23.520> putting<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.789> two<00:01:24.060> pieces

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
notice instead of putting in two pieces

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
notice instead of putting in two pieces
there<00:01:24.720> before<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.220> meant<00:01:26.399> like<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there before and it's meant like like a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.230 
there before and it's meant like like a
ballet<00:01:27.210> effect<00:01:27.690> I've<00:01:28.440> just<00:01:29.030> manipulated<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
ballet effect I've just manipulated and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.710 
ballet effect I've just manipulated and
done<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.110> template<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.070> piece<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
done a template for a one piece just to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.029 
done a template for a one piece just to
smooth<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.649> off

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
smooth it off

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.279 
smooth it off
I<00:01:35.069> couldn't<00:01:35.789> basically<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.390> cut<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.899> from

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
I couldn't basically back cut it from

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.370 
I couldn't basically back cut it from
the<00:01:37.470> inside<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.250> fold<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.729> anyway<00:01:39.149> but<00:01:40.050> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the inside and then fold it anyway but I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
the inside and then fold it anyway but I
told<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.190> go<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
told it to go down I would because it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.930 
told it to go down I would because it
doesn't<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.350> seen<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.130> detail<00:01:44.580> you

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
doesn't really get seen as a detail you

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.219 
doesn't really get seen as a detail you
could<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> detailed<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.840> platform

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
could I detailed to it but the platform

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.180 
could I detailed to it but the platform
is<00:01:49.319> what<00:01:49.740> case<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.690> NASA<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.929> thought<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
is what case or NASA and thought on so I

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.910 
is what case or NASA and thought on so I
finished<00:01:53.569> this<00:01:54.569> bit<00:01:54.899> should<00:01:55.110> open<00:01:55.350> ended<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
finished this bit should open ended and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.820 
finished this bit should open ended and
a<00:01:56.460> left<00:01:56.789> corner<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.630> preferred<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
a left corner but I preferred it to the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.109 
a left corner but I preferred it to the
flush<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.360> second<00:02:00.780> piece<00:02:00.929> here<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:02.119> flush

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
flush and the second piece here is flush

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.199 
flush and the second piece here is flush
I<00:02:03.509> tried<00:02:04.349> it<00:02:04.530> by<00:02:04.590> far<00:02:04.800> an<00:02:05.009> indentation<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
I tried it by far an indentation on it

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.619 
I tried it by far an indentation on it
and<00:02:07.039> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.879> didn't<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.479> look

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
and if I like but I didn't like the look

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.190 
and if I like but I didn't like the look
of<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.229> kept<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.709> flush<00:02:11.870> I've<00:02:12.870> kept

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of it so I just kept it flush I've kept

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.729 
of it so I just kept it flush I've kept
these<00:02:13.440> lists<00:02:14.129> because<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.349> these<00:02:16.349> are<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
these lists because and these are on the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.930 
these lists because and these are on the
EBA<00:02:17.099> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> moment<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:19.520> foster<00:02:20.520> once<00:02:20.790> I've

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
EBA at the moment and foster once I've

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.510 
EBA at the moment and foster once I've
kept<00:02:21.120> these<00:02:21.270> lists<00:02:21.629> basically<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.860> put

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
kept these lists basically you can put

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.210 
kept these lists basically you can put
them<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.800> lengthen<00:02:25.800> them<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.710 

I've<00:02:32.220> also<00:02:32.459> worked<00:02:32.849> on<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.620> elbow<00:02:34.620> joint<00:02:35.720> on

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I've also worked on the elbow joint on

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.009 
I've also worked on the elbow joint on
both<00:02:37.410> PCs<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:41.129> needs<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> slight<00:02:41.640> bend<00:02:42.629> in

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
both PCs and this needs a slight bend in

00:02:43.019 --> 00:03:09.730 
both PCs and this needs a slight bend in
that<00:02:43.500> does<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> does<00:02:44.730> fit<00:02:44.970> perfect

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.110 

you<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.460> their<00:03:11.610> own<00:03:11.730> lights<00:03:11.940> right

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you can see it on their own lights right

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.520 
you can see it on their own lights right
now<00:03:12.240> that's<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.540> how<00:03:12.690> use<00:03:12.840> at<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.050> moment<00:03:13.320> but

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
now that's not how use at the moment but

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.420 
now that's not how use at the moment but
you<00:03:14.310> can<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.580> what<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.850> FETs

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
you can see what it FETs

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:26.510 
you can see what it FETs
they<00:03:17.430> saw<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.760> movement<00:03:18.030> now

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.339

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
okay so there you have it long windows

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.960 
okay so there you have it long windows
I'm<00:03:29.500> going<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.709> meet<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.950> next<00:03:30.280> video<00:03:30.610> I'm

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
I'm going to meet the next video I'm

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.040 
I'm going to meet the next video I'm
going<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.360> run<00:03:31.569> down<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.830> angle<00:03:33.459> cuts<00:03:34.050> are

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
going to run down on the angle cuts are

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.660 
going to run down on the angle cuts are
used<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:37.530> possibly<00:03:38.530> some<00:03:38.739> techniques<00:03:39.250> that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
used and possibly some techniques that
