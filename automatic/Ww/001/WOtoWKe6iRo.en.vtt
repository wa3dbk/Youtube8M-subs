00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
although a bigger wider back is the goal

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.110 
although a bigger wider back is the goal
sometimes<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.410> bigger<00:00:04.920> taller<00:00:05.430> weight<00:00:05.790> stack

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
sometimes a bigger taller weight stack

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.070 
sometimes a bigger taller weight stack
is<00:00:06.660> not<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:07.109> answer

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
wider V tapered back now I mentioned the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.279 
wider V tapered back now I mentioned the
intro<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> resist<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> urge<00:00:28.050> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
intro we have to resist the urge to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
intro we have to resist the urge to
always<00:00:28.740> go<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> bigger<00:00:29.640> taller<00:00:30.269> weight

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
always go for a bigger taller weight

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
always go for a bigger taller weight
stack<00:00:30.810> mean<00:00:31.050> loading<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> weight<00:00:31.980> because

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
stack mean loading up the weight because

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
stack mean loading up the weight because
as<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.630> different<00:00:33.899> goals<00:00:34.380> for

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
as you see there's different goals for

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.130 
as you see there's different goals for
different<00:00:35.010> exercises<00:00:35.360> some<00:00:36.360> exercises<00:00:37.020> our

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
different exercises some exercises our

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
different exercises some exercises our
goal<00:00:37.320> should<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.879> simply<00:00:38.879> move<00:00:39.120> weight

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
goal should be to simply move weight

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
goal should be to simply move weight
where<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.260> other<00:00:40.469> exercises<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.969> really

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
where in other exercises we really

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.880 
where in other exercises we really
should<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.510> looking<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.870> contract<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> muscle

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
should be looking to contract the muscle

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
should be looking to contract the muscle
that<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.129> working<00:00:44.280> there's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> big<00:00:45.539> reason

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that we're working there's a big reason

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
that we're working there's a big reason
why<00:00:46.020> especially<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> back<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
why especially at the back because with

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
why especially at the back because with
the<00:00:47.579> back<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> situation<00:00:49.260> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the back what we have is a situation of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
the back what we have is a situation of
out<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.460> sight<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> line<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.780> can't<00:00:52.050> see

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
out of sight out of line you can't see

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
out of sight out of line you can't see
it<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it you don't really have that much of a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
it you don't really have that much of a
conscious<00:00:55.320> effort<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> put<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
conscious effort that you put into it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
conscious effort that you put into it
yeah<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.270> pulling<00:00:57.629> hard<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
yeah you're pulling hard and the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
yeah you're pulling hard and the
tendency<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
tendency is to do a lot more of that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
tendency is to do a lot more of that
moving<00:01:00.539> weight<00:01:00.780> type<00:01:01.050> exercise<00:01:01.500> than<00:01:02.070> there

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
moving weight type exercise than there

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
moving weight type exercise than there
is<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> conscious<00:01:03.420> contraction<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is to put that conscious contraction so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
is to put that conscious contraction so
what<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> recommend

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
what I recommend

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
what I recommend
my<00:01:06.869> best<00:01:07.140> tip<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.680> trying<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.159> build<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
my best tip if you're trying to build a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
my best tip if you're trying to build a
wider<00:01:08.909> V<00:01:09.570> taper<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.530> better

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
wider V taper is that you better

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
wider V taper is that you better
activate<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> lats<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.570> better<00:01:12.780> develop<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
activate the lats you better develop the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
activate the lats you better develop the
latch<00:01:13.470> through<00:01:13.890> their<00:01:14.010> full<00:01:14.220> range<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> motion

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
latch through their full range of motion

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
latch through their full range of motion
in<00:01:15.000> order<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
in order to do that so how do we do it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
in order to do that so how do we do it
a<00:01:16.890> couple<00:01:17.580> different<00:01:17.880> ways<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.750> we

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a couple different ways first of all we

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
a couple different ways first of all we
have<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.979> wide<00:01:20.580> set<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.390> you're

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
have to get a wide set up if you're

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
have to get a wide set up if you're
doing<00:01:22.080> pull-ups<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.950> means<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> wide<00:01:23.460> grip<00:01:23.790> if

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
doing pull-ups that means a wide grip if

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
doing pull-ups that means a wide grip if
you're<00:01:24.540> doing<00:01:24.750> some<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> cable<00:01:25.799> set<00:01:26.130> up

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you're doing some kind of a cable set up

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.910 
you're doing some kind of a cable set up
here<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.299> cables<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.930> wide<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
here they get these cables out wide you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
here they get these cables out wide you
can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.610> necessarily<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> bar

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
can see I don't necessarily like the bar

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
can see I don't necessarily like the bar
as<00:01:31.170> much<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> individual<00:01:32.280> cable

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
as much I like the individual cable

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
as much I like the individual cable
handle<00:01:32.909> screw<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.150> allows<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
handle screw that allows me to do that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.370 
handle screw that allows me to do that
why<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.040> because<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.659> gives<00:01:36.930> us<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.229> little

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
why is that because it gives us a little

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550 
why is that because it gives us a little
bit<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> better<00:01:38.040> angle<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.790> pull<00:01:39.229> for<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
bit of a better angle of pull for the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
bit of a better angle of pull for the
lats<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> last<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
lats all right the last you're going to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.830 
lats all right the last you're going to
run<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.860> direction<00:01:44.070> okay<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.689> like

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
run in this direction okay just like

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
run in this direction okay just like
that<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.619> ironically<00:01:47.280> they're<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that and ironically they're going to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.850 
that and ironically they're going to
attach<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.960> only<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.439> only<00:01:49.560> muscle

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
attach all the way only the only muscle

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
attach all the way only the only muscle
group<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.399> connect<00:01:50.970> upper<00:01:51.270> body

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
group that actually connect upper body

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
group that actually connect upper body
and<00:01:51.630> lower<00:01:51.720> body<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:53.040> we're<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and lower body here where we're going to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.209 
and lower body here where we're going to
have<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> attached<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.880> our<00:01:54.509> arm<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
have it attached to our arm the back of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.130 
have it attached to our arm the back of
our<00:01:56.310> humours<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
our humours here and all the way in to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
our humours here and all the way in to
really<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> top<00:01:59.189> partly<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> pressed<00:02:00.090> our<00:02:00.270> hips

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
really the top partly I pressed our hips

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
really the top partly I pressed our hips
because<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.159> fashion<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.670> connects

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because of the the fashion that connects

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
because of the the fashion that connects
through<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> lumbar<00:02:04.200> spine<00:02:04.290> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
through the back and the lumbar spine so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.340 
through the back and the lumbar spine so
it<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.579> big<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> muscle<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.170> want

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it is that big of a muscle and we want

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
it is that big of a muscle and we want
to<00:02:07.409> make<00:02:07.560> sure<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.950> take<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.280> through<00:02:08.489> his

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
to make sure that we take it through his

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.930 
to make sure that we take it through his
full<00:02:09.149> range<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
full range so the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.390 
full range so the
what<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> do<00:02:10.479> get<00:02:10.780> those<00:02:10.990> handles<00:02:11.260> out<00:02:11.470> wide<00:02:11.740> so

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
what I do get those handles out wide so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.030 
what I do get those handles out wide so
that<00:02:12.460> our<00:02:12.700> arms<00:02:13.090> are<00:02:13.210> like<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> V<00:02:13.780> position<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
that our arms are like a V position to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.960 
that our arms are like a V position to
actually<00:02:15.550> help<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.300> get<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.720> V<00:02:16.900> taper<00:02:17.140> now

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
actually help to get that V taper now

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.110 
actually help to get that V taper now
when<00:02:18.970> they<00:02:19.120> come<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.890> want<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.160> pull<00:02:21.460> so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
when they come down we want to pull so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
when they come down we want to pull so
that<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.560> elbows<00:02:23.560> come<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.160> close<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that the elbows come in close to the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.780 
that the elbows come in close to the
body<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.920> tight<00:02:26.920> okay

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
body and tight okay

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.420 
body and tight okay
up<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.960> out<00:02:29.080> all<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.710> way<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.250> get<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
up and out all the way so we get a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.050 
up and out all the way so we get a
stretch<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.980> down<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.520> tight

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
stretch and then in and down and tight

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.770 
stretch and then in and down and tight
now<00:02:34.900> here's<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> two<00:02:35.650> tips<00:02:36.570> we're<00:02:37.570> going<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
now here's the two tips we're going to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.980 
now here's the two tips we're going to
turn<00:02:37.990> our<00:02:38.200> hands<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:39.190> way<00:02:39.400> okay<00:02:40.270> turn<00:02:40.840> them

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
turn our hands this way okay turn them

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.400 
turn our hands this way okay turn them
out

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
out

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.830 
out
charting<00:02:42.400> amounts<00:02:42.760> actually<00:02:43.150> cause<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.510> into

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
charting amounts actually cause you into

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.420 
charting amounts actually cause you into
our<00:02:43.930> rotation<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.860> shoulder<00:02:45.190> joint

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
our rotation up to the shoulder joint

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.390 
our rotation up to the shoulder joint
the<00:02:46.300> lats<00:02:46.570> are<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.020> help<00:02:47.260> us<00:02:47.470> internally

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the lats are going to help us internally

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.920 
the lats are going to help us internally
rotate<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.030> want<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.240> fully<00:02:49.420> contract

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
rotate so if you want to fully contract

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.020 
rotate so if you want to fully contract
them<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.170> we're<00:02:50.800> talking<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:51.190> actually

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
them and we're talking about actually

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.790 
them and we're talking about actually
contracting<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> lats<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.080> that's<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.620> key

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
contracting the lats here that's the key

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.710 
contracting the lats here that's the key
guys<00:02:54.010> you're<00:02:54.280> developing<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.820> shape<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.660> we

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
guys you're developing that shape and we

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.810 
guys you're developing that shape and we
want<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.960> turn<00:02:56.140> our<00:02:56.200> hands<00:02:56.650> out<00:02:56.800> turn<00:02:57.670> our

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
want to turn our hands out turn our

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.540 
want to turn our hands out turn our
hands<00:02:58.090> out<00:02:58.300> now<00:02:59.080> same<00:02:59.830> concept<00:03:00.100> down<00:03:01.030> up<00:03:01.750> wide

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
hands out now same concept down up wide

squeeze okay now what's the last tip the
last<00:03:19.750> tip<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.230> if<00:03:20.440> we<00:03:20.530> want<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.770> really<00:03:21.070> enforce

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
last tip is if we want to really enforce

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.479 
last tip is if we want to really enforce
what<00:03:22.720> we're<00:03:22.959> doing<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:24.250> want<00:03:24.430> to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
what we're doing here and we want to

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.760 
what we're doing here and we want to
really<00:03:24.760> work<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.270> contraction<00:03:25.959> yeah<00:03:26.320> you

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
really work on contraction yeah you

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.050 
really work on contraction yeah you
might<00:03:26.980> have<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.340> drop<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.790> weight<00:03:28.030> down

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
might have to drop that weight down

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
might have to drop that weight down
because<00:03:29.050> we're<00:03:29.800> not<00:03:29.920> talking<00:03:30.250> about<00:03:30.310> doing

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
because we're not talking about doing

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.720 
because we're not talking about doing
generating<00:03:32.080> momentum<00:03:32.500> here<00:03:33.130> for<00:03:33.580> lat

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
generating momentum here for lat

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.830 
generating momentum here for lat
pull-downs<00:03:33.970> we're<00:03:34.270> talking<00:03:34.480> about<00:03:34.570> actually

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
pull-downs we're talking about actually

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.900 
pull-downs we're talking about actually
contracting<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:36.280> going<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.489> want<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
contracting so you're going to want to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.370 
contracting so you're going to want to
make<00:03:37.090> sure<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.450> do<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.050> drop<00:03:38.260> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
make sure you do that and drop the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.470 
make sure you do that and drop the
weight<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:39.310> technique<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.820> can<00:03:39.940> use<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.180> what

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
weight one technique you can use is what

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.990 
weight one technique you can use is what
we<00:03:40.570> call<00:03:40.780> one<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.170> half<00:03:41.380> reps<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.610> allows

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
we call one and a half reps that allows

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.910 
we call one and a half reps that allows
us<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.330> ensure<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:44.050> we<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.680> slow<00:03:44.890> it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
us to ensure that we have to slow it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.699 
us to ensure that we have to slow it
down<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.459> also<00:03:46.390> drop<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.019> weight<00:03:47.200> with<00:03:47.680> one

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
down and also drop the weight with one

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.290 
down and also drop the weight with one
and<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> half<00:03:48.160> reps<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.610> if<00:03:48.700> everything<00:03:49.150> go<00:03:49.269> up

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
and a half reps and if everything go up

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.600 
and a half reps and if everything go up
just<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.870> little<00:03:49.900> bit<00:03:50.110> with<00:03:51.070> one<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> half

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
just a little bit with one and a half

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.720 
just a little bit with one and a half
reps<00:03:53.730> basically<00:03:54.750> we're<00:03:55.750> going<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> come<00:03:56.050> down

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
reps basically we're going to come down

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.250 
reps basically we're going to come down
squeeze<00:03:58.650> okay<00:03:59.650> all<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.190> way<00:04:00.450> halfway<00:04:01.450> back

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
squeeze okay all the way halfway back

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.390 
squeeze okay all the way halfway back
down<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.800> squeeze<00:04:03.040> again

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
down and squeeze again

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.630 
down and squeeze again
and<00:04:04.390> then<00:04:04.660> up<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.620> full<00:04:05.920> okay

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
and then up and full okay

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.349 
down pull halfway back down and up again
now<00:04:14.830> if<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.160> haven't<00:04:15.610> been<00:04:15.700> doing<00:04:15.850> these<00:04:16.180> type

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
now if you haven't been doing these type

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.150 
now if you haven't been doing these type
of<00:04:16.390> exercises<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.169> really<00:04:17.380> contracting<00:04:18.070> your

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
of exercises and really contracting your

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.970 
of exercises and really contracting your
back<00:04:18.370> deliberately

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
back deliberately

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.590 
back deliberately
you'll<00:04:20.490> see<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.730> big<00:04:20.970> difference<00:04:21.000> when<00:04:21.510> you

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
you'll see a big difference when you

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.120 
you'll see a big difference when you
start<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.960> train<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.320> way<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.770> matter<00:04:23.040> of

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
start to train this way in matter of

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.250 
start to train this way in matter of
fact<00:04:23.190> you're<00:04:23.700> going<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.910> be<00:04:24.060> humbled<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.540> bit<00:04:24.750> by

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
fact you're going to be humbled a bit by

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.330 
fact you're going to be humbled a bit by
how<00:04:25.410> much<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.710> might<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.070> cut<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
how much you might have to cut the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.330 
how much you might have to cut the
weight<00:04:26.460> stack<00:04:26.730> down<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.600> do<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:27.930> but<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
weight stack down to do this but the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.720 
weight stack down to do this but the
benefits<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.900> combined<00:04:31.710> with<00:04:32.070> heavy

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
benefits of this combined with heavy

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.090 
benefits of this combined with heavy
weight<00:04:33.090> training<00:04:33.360> those<00:04:34.140> exercises<00:04:34.770> where

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
weight training those exercises where

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.380 
weight training those exercises where
you're<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.400> moving<00:04:35.640> your<00:04:35.850> weight<00:04:36.780> around<00:04:37.100> is

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
you're just moving your weight around is

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:46.430 
you're just moving your weight around is
enormous<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:44.490> it's<00:04:44.610> what<00:04:44.730> allows<00:04:45.030> us<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.440> get

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
enormous but it's what allows us to get

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.700 
enormous but it's what allows us to get
more<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.460> feed<00:04:47.640> taper<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.630> back<00:04:48.840> because

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
more of a feed taper in the back because

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.280 
more of a feed taper in the back because
we're<00:04:49.860> actually<00:04:50.300> conscious<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.480> contracting

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
we're actually conscious of contracting

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.350 
we're actually conscious of contracting
the<00:04:52.380> muscle<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.400> guides<00:04:53.520> me<00:04:53.760> your<00:04:53.880> training

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the muscle so it guides me your training

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.660 
the muscle so it guides me your training
as<00:04:54.540> we<00:04:54.810> do<00:04:54.930> in<00:04:55.050> athlean-x<00:04:55.500> you've<00:04:56.220> got<00:04:56.400> to<00:04:56.520> have

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
as we do in athlean-x you've got to have

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.380 
as we do in athlean-x you've got to have
a<00:04:56.910> balance<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.810> both<00:04:58.730> functionally<00:04:59.730> sometimes

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
deliberate contraction so that what

we're doing is purposeful and we're

we're doing is purposeful and we're
