00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.880 

there<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.319> are<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.569> red<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:57.780> white<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.710> in

there they are the red and white was in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.480 
there they are the red and white was in
the<00:01:58.979> piggy<00:01:59.189> backs<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> did<00:02:02.220> as<00:02:02.429> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the piggy backs then what I did as you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.309 
the piggy backs then what I did as you
can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.920> hdmi<00:02:04.920> port<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.319> two

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
can see my hdmi port and then the two

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.900 
can see my hdmi port and then the two
audio<00:02:08.179> ports<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:13.250> decide<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> put<00:02:14.549> my<00:02:14.670> piggy

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
audio ports I decide to put my piggy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.570 
audio ports I decide to put my piggy
back<00:02:15.120> cables<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:15.780> their<00:02:16.110> butt<00:02:16.410> well<00:02:17.099> nothing

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
back cables into their butt well nothing

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.680 
back cables into their butt well nothing
happened<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.180> they're<00:02:18.569> not

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
happened because they're not

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870 
happened because they're not
piggybacking<00:02:19.290> off<00:02:19.590> any<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.310> audio

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
piggybacking off any you know audio

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.180 
piggybacking off any you know audio
because<00:02:21.150> hdmi<00:02:22.049> does<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.319> all<00:02:22.440> for<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:25.190> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
because hdmi does it all for you so

because hdmi does it all for you so
you're<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> need<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> cable<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
you're going to need the cable on the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.470 
you're going to need the cable on the
left<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.829> get<00:02:29.010> your<00:02:29.280> turtle<00:02:29.940> beach's<00:02:30.239> toward

one off ebay so I kind of came up with
my<00:03:03.690> own<00:03:03.720> solution<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.130> use<00:03:08.280> your<00:03:08.609> hdmi

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110

now as you can see that little nub there

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.080 
now as you can see that little nub there
that<00:03:16.080> does<00:03:16.320> not<00:03:16.500> allow<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.980> hdmi<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.670> plug<00:03:17.910> in

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
that does not allow the hdmi to plug in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.270 
that does not allow the hdmi to plug in
at<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.360> same<00:03:18.540> time<00:03:18.810> as<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.040> kind

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
at the same time as you can see the kind
