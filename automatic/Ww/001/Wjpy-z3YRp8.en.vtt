definitely like to get my hands dirty
growing<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.340> always<00:00:23.430> interested<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
growing up I was always interested in

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.290 
growing up I was always interested in
cars<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.050> bikes<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:26.460> enjoyed<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
cars and bikes and really enjoyed that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.679 
cars and bikes and really enjoyed that
side

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
side

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.439 
side
and<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.099> getting<00:00:29.340> into<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.060> guess

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and and really getting into the I guess

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920 
and and really getting into the I guess
grassroots<00:00:31.410> engineering<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> speak<00:00:32.930> what

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
grassroots engineering so to speak what

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
grassroots engineering so to speak what
I've<00:00:34.170> seen<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> automotive<00:00:35.340> industry<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
I've seen in the automotive industry is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.069 
I've seen in the automotive industry is
it's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.290> fantastic<00:00:38.100> place<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:39.360> involved

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it's a fantastic place to be involved

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
it's a fantastic place to be involved
with<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> new<00:00:41.820> technology<00:00:42.390> that's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
with all of the new technology that's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
with all of the new technology that's
coming<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.460> really

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
coming out and this this is really

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.729 
coming out and this this is really
exciting<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.420> especially<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.350> engineer

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
exciting for especially for an engineer

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.180 
exciting for especially for an engineer
and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.760> don't<00:00:47.820> think<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.629> would<00:00:49.010> have<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and I don't think you would have that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
and I don't think you would have that
opportunity<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.420> most<00:00:51.629> other<00:00:51.840> industries

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
opportunity in in most other industries

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
opportunity in in most other industries
and<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> enjoy<00:00:53.940> most

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and that's really what I enjoy most

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
and that's really what I enjoy most
about<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> motive<00:00:55.530> engineering<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.219> being

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
about what a motive engineering is being

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490 
about what a motive engineering is being
involved<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> technology<00:00:57.809> taking<00:00:58.050> part

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
involved with the technology taking part

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.060 
involved with the technology taking part
and<00:00:59.210> actually<00:01:00.210> creating<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> contributing

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and actually creating and contributing

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.340 
and actually creating and contributing
to<00:01:02.100> two<00:01:03.059> vehicles<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.110> the

to two vehicles that are out on the
market<00:01:04.650> today<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:06.090> enjoy<00:01:06.210> in

advanced engineering areas coming up

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
advanced engineering areas coming up
with<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> concept<00:01:10.650> thinking<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> something

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
with the concept thinking of something

figuring out about what it's going to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.200 
figuring out about what it's going to
take<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.119> work<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.380> actually

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
take to make it work and then actually

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.990 
take to make it work and then actually
getting<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> putting<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> into<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> vehicle<00:01:19.560> and

getting it putting it into a vehicle and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.990 
getting it putting it into a vehicle and
proving<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.630> advice<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.350> give<00:01:22.380> would

proving it the advice I would give would
be<00:01:24.000> first<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> figure<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
be first of all to figure out what you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
be first of all to figure out what you
want<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.479> professional<00:01:28.350> career<00:01:28.860> be

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640

want from your professional career be
true<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> yourself<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.310> what

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
true to yourself and then for me what

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
true to yourself and then for me what
was<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:32.850> important<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> figure<00:01:34.110> out

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
was very important was to figure out

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
was very important was to figure out
what<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.770> enjoyed<00:01:35.250> doing<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
what I actually enjoyed doing I think if

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
what I actually enjoyed doing I think if
if<00:01:37.079> somebody<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:38.210> excellent<00:01:39.210> marks<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
if somebody has excellent marks that is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.649 
if somebody has excellent marks that is
often<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.610> everything<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
often not it's not everything it it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
often not it's not everything it it
might<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.229> enough<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.920> certain

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
might not be enough to get certain

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
might not be enough to get certain
certain<00:01:48.180> jobs<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.320> experiences<00:01:50.040> I've

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
certain jobs and the experiences I've

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.920 
certain jobs and the experiences I've
had<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.909> industry<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
had in the industry a lot of the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.030 
had in the industry a lot of the
extracurricular<00:01:54.930> activities<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.590> I've

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
extracurricular activities that I've

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
extracurricular activities that I've
been<00:01:56.219> involved<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.969> helped<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> lot

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
been involved with have helped me a lot

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
been involved with have helped me a lot
in<00:01:57.960> getting<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> places<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.250> wanted<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> go

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
in getting to the places I wanted to go

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
in getting to the places I wanted to go
I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> most<00:02:00.390> interesting<00:02:00.890> project<00:02:01.890> we

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I think the most interesting project we

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.830 
I think the most interesting project we
worked<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:04.280> research<00:02:05.280> project

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
worked on was for a research project

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
worked on was for a research project
funded<00:02:06.840> by<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.140> UK<00:02:07.409> government<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.340> was

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
funded by the UK government this was

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.080 
funded by the UK government this was
quite<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> big<00:02:08.910> project<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.229> working<00:02:10.649> on

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
quite a big project and I was working on

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
quite a big project and I was working on
regenerative<00:02:12.090> braking

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
regenerative braking

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.300 
regenerative braking
and<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:14.900> researched<00:02:15.900> some<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.380> exciting<00:02:16.980> new

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and we researched some very exciting new

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.300 
and we researched some very exciting new
technologies<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.690> actually

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
technologies there and we actually

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
technologies there and we actually
developed<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.810> prototype<00:02:21.810> vehicle<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.860> was

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
developed a prototype vehicle that was

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.880 
developed a prototype vehicle that was
quite<00:02:23.160> exciting<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.440> Jaguar

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
quite exciting it was as a Jaguar

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.980 
quite exciting it was as a Jaguar
vehicle<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.520> believe<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:26.970> called<00:02:27.120> limo<00:02:27.750> green

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
vehicle I believe is called limo green

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.680 
vehicle I believe is called limo green
that<00:02:28.980> was<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.060> quite<00:02:30.210> an<00:02:30.390> enjoyable

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
that was that was quite an enjoyable

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.710 
that was that was quite an enjoyable
