 [Music] 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320
 president ollanta humala met 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.990
 with the former rulers Alejandro Toledo 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 and Alan Garcia to inform them about the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 political agenda after the failure of the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 court of justice of the beech is a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.079
 logical and normal meeting that the boss of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.169
 been report of the incidents of 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:31.290
 this jurisdictional process 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.720
 international before the presidents who 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.880
 so they also know him and maybe 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.399
 they will know then they will have drawn 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 strategies about how to face 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.950
 this situation once you have 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.450
 full knowledge of the scope of the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 judgment 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 the meeting where the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 Prime Minister and the Peruvian Foreign Minister 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.330
 lasted just over an hour then both ex 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.180
 presidents retired without giving 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.980
 declarations 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.570
 For his part, the president of the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 foreign relations commission of 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.430
 Congress hopes that relations between 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.180
 Peru and Chile are not affected 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.310
 important relationships for both countries 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.460
 in any order of things in the field 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.250
 politician in the commercial field in the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.750
 financial field in the economic field 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 of investments 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.010
 I hope then that does not deteriorate 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.090
 because that could mean a 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.420
 impairment for Chile and for Peru I think 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.250
 that we need to understand more than 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.080
 enter a compass of conflicts 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.030
 the reading of the sentence is 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 scheduled for next Monday 27 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.020
 where the maritime dispute will be defined 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.270
 in dispute between Peru and Chile 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.830
 in 2008 Peru sued Chile before the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.570
 Beech cut to define 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.460
 maritime boundaries in a line 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.190
 equidistant on the coasts of both 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 countries with the argument that these 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.140
 they were never set but the fact that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 the case 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 has been accepted by the court of the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.440
 have and have done a whole journey 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 legal and now we are before elimines 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.110
 the ruling is already let's say an advance in the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.570
 strategy and plasma of Peru 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.700
 once the ruling is given both countries 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.500
 they will have to treat it since this will not be 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.750
 appealable countries can see a 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.570
 interpretation of the ruling but the ruling 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 is unappealable or you can ask the 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.190
 court a country can ask the court 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.250
 let me explain why this says 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.380
 failure 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.390
 but the use failure was to change if 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.500
 has to meet to be president of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.390
 they left the meeting without giving 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 statements this meeting has been 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.440
 greeted by the political sectors as 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.300
 a gesture of unity jorge de la quintana
