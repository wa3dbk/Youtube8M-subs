my skin it just really feels oily still
so<00:04:07.019> I'm<00:04:07.860> not<00:04:08.160> really<00:04:09.260> finding<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.500> product<00:04:11.120> as

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
so I'm not really finding the product as

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.990 
so I'm not really finding the product as
I'd<00:04:13.560> hope<00:04:13.920> I'd<00:04:14.160> find<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.730> which<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:17.000> amazingly

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
I'd hope I'd find it which is amazingly

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.830 
I'd hope I'd find it which is amazingly
cool<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:20.669> used<00:04:20.970> on<00:04:21.120> your<00:04:21.269> hair<00:04:21.510> face

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
cool to have it used on your hair face

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.300 
cool to have it used on your hair face
and<00:04:22.169> body<00:04:22.590> so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.740 

so<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:30.260> doesn't<00:04:30.470> look<00:04:30.710> as<00:04:30.890> oily<00:04:31.480> as<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:32.600> guys

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so it doesn't look as oily as you guys

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.080 
so it doesn't look as oily as you guys
can<00:04:32.990> see<00:04:33.260> because<00:04:33.920> my<00:04:34.190> scan<00:04:34.490> was<00:04:34.640> really<00:04:34.880> dry

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
can see because my scan was really dry

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.810 
can see because my scan was really dry
so<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.350> said<00:04:36.410> it's<00:04:36.860> somewhat<00:04:37.250> absorbed

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
so like I said it's somewhat absorbed

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.170 
so like I said it's somewhat absorbed
but<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.650> feeling<00:04:39.650> on<00:04:39.830> my<00:04:39.890> fingertips<00:04:40.700> really

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
but the feeling on my fingertips really

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.480 
but the feeling on my fingertips really
feels<00:04:41.510> oily<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.860> if<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:43.070> were<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.280> pull<00:04:43.460> out

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
feels oily so if you were to pull out

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.130 
feels oily so if you were to pull out
your<00:04:43.700> cell<00:04:43.910> phone<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.570> touch<00:04:44.960> your

smartphone and your touch screens you

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.620 
smartphone and your touch screens you
are<00:04:49.070> probably<00:04:49.460> gonna<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:49.970> fingerprints<00:04:50.510> all

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
are probably gonna have fingerprints all

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.360 
are probably gonna have fingerprints all
over<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:53.470> don't<00:04:54.470> think<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.770> guys<00:04:54.920> can<00:04:55.220> hear

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370

residue<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.510> bottle<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.290> because

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
residue on the bottle it's because

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.270 
residue on the bottle it's because
