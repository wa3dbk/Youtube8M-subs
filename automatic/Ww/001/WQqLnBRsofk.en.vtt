in<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.620> video<00:00:05.009> I'm<00:00:05.520> going<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.759> show<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:05.970> how

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.600 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.330> set<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> points<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.350> old<00:00:08.309> Honda<00:00:08.849> XL<00:00:09.360> 250

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
to set the points on old Honda XL 250

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.780 
to set the points on old Honda XL 250
let's<00:00:11.610> get<00:00:11.790> started<00:00:13.160> these<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> tools

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
let's get started these are the tools

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
let's get started these are the tools
I'll<00:00:15.030> need<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.570> project<00:00:20.449> we<00:00:21.449> take

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I'll need for this project we take

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
I'll need for this project we take
remove<00:00:22.820> remove<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> spark<00:00:24.210> plug<00:00:24.330> cap<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
remove remove the spark plug cap and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.370 
remove remove the spark plug cap and
remove<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.460> spark<00:00:26.699> plug<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:30.420> helps<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
remove the spark plug this helps you to

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
remove the spark plug this helps you to
turn<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> engine<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:32.759> you're<00:00:32.910> setting

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
turn the engine over when you're setting

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
turn the engine over when you're setting
the<00:00:33.390> ignition<00:00:34.040> you'll<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> remove<00:00:35.670> these

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

two<00:00:36.090> covers<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.649> points<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.129> behind<00:00:38.430> here

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
two covers the points are behind here

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.000 
two covers the points are behind here
and<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.570> flywheel<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.790> behind<00:00:41.790> here

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
and the flywheel is behind here

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.610 
and the flywheel is behind here
place<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.190> screws<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> cover<00:00:45.410> now<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
place your screws in the cover now that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.110 
place your screws in the cover now that
we<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> covers<00:00:47.460> removed<00:00:48.469> feed<00:00:49.469> off

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
we have the covers removed feed off

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
we have the covers removed feed off
small<00:00:51.120> breaker<00:00:51.390> bar<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> wait<00:00:52.800> turn<00:00:53.129> the

couple times counterclockwise because

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
couple times counterclockwise because
that's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> motor<00:01:00.719> runs<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.489> find

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that's the way the motor runs and find

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's the way the motor runs and find
the<00:01:02.640> timing<00:01:02.910> marks<00:01:03.949> rotate<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> around<00:01:05.250> till

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the timing marks rotate it around till

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.850

meter moves to the top so to adjust when
it<00:04:10.930> fires<00:04:11.610> I'm<00:04:12.610> moving<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.269> plate<00:04:13.720> back<00:04:14.500> and

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
it fires I'm moving this plate back and

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.930 
it fires I'm moving this plate back and
forth<00:04:15.010> until<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.269> mark<00:04:16.600> lines<00:04:16.959> up<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.940> the

forth until the mark lines up and the
meter<00:04:19.180> moves<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.680> let's<00:04:20.890> do<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.050 

send<00:04:24.560> up<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.800> screws<00:04:26.560> set<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:28.340> flywheel<00:04:28.880> on

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
send up the screws set the flywheel on

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.529 
send up the screws set the flywheel on
the<00:04:29.360> fire<00:04:29.660> mark<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.610> now<00:04:31.850> we're<00:04:32.120> just<00:04:32.240> going

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
the fire mark and now we're just going

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:40.450 
the fire mark and now we're just going
to<00:04:34.180> tap<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:35.449> around<00:04:37.720> watch<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.020> mirror<00:04:39.460> this

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
to tap this around watch the mirror this

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:51.490 
to tap this around watch the mirror this
round

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.709

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.879 

then<00:05:02.950> I'm<00:05:03.100> gonna<00:05:03.220> check<00:05:03.610> it

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
then I'm gonna check it

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.440 
then I'm gonna check it
I'm<00:05:05.009> going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.310> back<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.759> up
