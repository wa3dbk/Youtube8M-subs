far so I can't do that and that would be

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940

you can argue against it but for me the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
you can argue against it but for me the
game<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.700> nowhere<00:01:51.180> near<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> realism<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
game is nowhere near the realism that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
game is nowhere near the realism that
FIFA<00:01:52.649> has<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.820> close<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> real<00:01:54.630> life

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
FIFA has it's not close to real life

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
FIFA has it's not close to real life
football<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.460> sort<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
football at all but the sort of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.039 
football at all but the sort of
subsection<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> cover<00:01:57.780> first

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
subsection I'm just going to cover first

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
subsection I'm just going to cover first
is<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> graphics<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.700> graphics<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.840> don't

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
is the graphics the graphics are I don't

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
is the graphics the graphics are I don't
know<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.159> seemed<00:02:02.340> arcade<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
know that just seemed arcade like and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.690 
know that just seemed arcade like and
then<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.020> goes<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.500> whole<00:02:04.920> game<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.549> my

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
then that goes the whole game in my

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.389 
then that goes the whole game in my
opinion<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.719> look<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.350> though<00:02:07.920> it's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
opinion they don't look as though it's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
opinion they don't look as though it's
trying<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> reflect<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> real<00:02:09.569> football<00:02:09.810> game

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
trying to reflect the real football game

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
trying to reflect the real football game
on<00:02:10.259> TV<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.920> just<00:02:11.160> looks<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.700> trying<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
on TV it just looks like it's trying to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.540 
on TV it just looks like it's trying to
be<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.270> arcade<00:02:12.690> game

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
be an arcade game

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.060 
be an arcade game
and<00:02:13.610> i'm<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:14.690> sure<00:02:14.750> why<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.680> maybe

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
and i'm not sure why that is is maybe

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.130 
and i'm not sure why that is is maybe
probably<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> konami<00:02:17.360> influence<00:02:17.960> on

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
probably because the konami influence on

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.670 
probably because the konami influence on
it<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.600> i'm<00:02:20.930> not<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.140> hundred<00:02:21.290> percent<00:02:21.440> sure

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it it and i'm not a hundred percent sure

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.400 
it it and i'm not a hundred percent sure
why<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.400> feels<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.840> seems

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
why it just feels like that it seems

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.080 
why it just feels like that it seems
like<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.830> replays<00:02:25.340> as<00:02:25.580> well<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
like on the replays as well that the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.650 
like on the replays as well that the
game<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.680> are<00:02:27.890> some<00:02:28.430> fair<00:02:28.940> familiar<00:02:29.480> with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
sony vegas you'll know there's something

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.520 
sony vegas you'll know there's something
called<00:02:31.510> resample<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:32.750> men<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.960> disable

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
called resample and your men to disable

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.960 
called resample and your men to disable
it<00:02:33.620> when<00:02:33.770> you've<00:02:33.890> got<00:02:33.980> gameplay<00:02:34.430> otherwise<00:02:34.730> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
it when you've got gameplay otherwise it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.140 
it when you've got gameplay otherwise it
seems<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.740> almost<00:02:36.740> put<00:02:37.310> an<00:02:37.400> image<00:02:37.640> over<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
seems to almost put an image over the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.690 
seems to almost put an image over the
gameplay<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.770> appears<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:40.460> if<00:02:40.490> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
gameplay so it it appears as if the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.310 
gameplay so it it appears as if the
frame<00:02:40.910> rates<00:02:41.210> lower<00:02:41.450> almost<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.200> what

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
frame rates lower almost and that's what

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.080 
frame rates lower almost and that's what
it<00:02:42.410> feels<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.980> pairs<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.490> feels<00:02:43.970> like

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it feels like on pairs it feels like

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.070 
it feels like on pairs it feels like
they<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.960> too<00:02:45.500> smooth<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:47.420> just<00:02:47.810> it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
they it's too smooth and it just it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.360 
they it's too smooth and it just it
doesn't<00:02:48.350> look<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:50.420> too<00:02:51.380> flowing

players feel it feel very jerky and it's
not<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.750> not<00:03:09.050> close<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.680> fifa<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.130> my<00:03:10.250> opinion

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
not it's not close to fifa in my opinion

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.060 
not it's not close to fifa in my opinion
and<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.720> definitely<00:03:12.050> not<00:03:12.200> close<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.710> fifa

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
and it's definitely not close to fifa

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.460 
and it's definitely not close to fifa
with<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.340> as<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.490> few<00:03:13.700> years<00:03:14.110> that's<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.380> my

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
with it as a few years that's just my

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.130 
with it as a few years that's just my
opinion<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.880> other<00:03:17.060> part<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.570> realism<00:03:17.900> got

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
opinion on the other part of realism got

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.220 
opinion on the other part of realism got
to<00:03:18.260> cover<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.920> actual<00:03:19.220> game<00:03:19.250> pie<00:03:19.700> and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
to cover is the actual game pie and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.670 
to cover is the actual game pie and
again<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.709> does<00:03:22.130> not<00:03:22.430> come<00:03:23.090> close<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:24.230> fifa

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
again that does not come close to fifa

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.630 
again that does not come close to fifa
nor<00:03:25.430> does<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:25.970> come<00:03:26.209> close<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.720> ID<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.220> i<00:03:28.400> don't

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
nor does it come close to ID but i don't

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.490 
nor does it come close to ID but i don't
know<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.000> doesn't<00:03:29.270> come<00:03:29.570> close<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:30.020> what

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
know it just doesn't come close to what

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.040 
know it just doesn't come close to what
real<00:03:30.739> life<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.970> players<00:03:32.239> seem<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.810> all

is<00:03:42.440> only<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:43.340> player<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.700> I've<00:03:43.790> noticed

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
is only one player that I've noticed

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.130 
is only one player that I've noticed
it's<00:03:44.270> different<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.630> others<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.050> that's

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
it's different to others and that's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.680 
it's different to others and that's
Neymar<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:45.860> far<00:03:46.160> all<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.120> others<00:03:47.330> just<00:03:47.510> feel

Neymar so far all the others just feel

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.120 
Neymar so far all the others just feel
the<00:03:47.840> same<00:03:48.020> as<00:03:48.140> each<00:03:48.260> other<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.590> attackers<00:03:48.980> all

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
to be a little bit nimble more nimble

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.479 
to be a little bit nimble more nimble

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.630 
feel the same they're all well-built
kind<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.500> thing<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.070> defenders<00:03:58.459> just

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
kind of thing and the defenders just

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.100 
kind of thing and the defenders just
feel<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:58.880> good<00:03:59.090> tacklers<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.720> they're<00:03:59.900> not

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
feel like good tacklers that they're not

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.840 
feel like good tacklers that they're not
individual<00:04:01.100> whatsoever<00:04:01.550> there's<00:04:01.730> no

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
individual whatsoever there's no

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.390 
individual whatsoever there's no
difference<00:04:02.570> between<00:04:03.200> any<00:04:03.470> player<00:04:04.070> they<00:04:04.280> are

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
difference between any player they are

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.340 
difference between any player they are
literally<00:04:04.670> just<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.030> same<00:04:05.239> player<00:04:05.570> but<00:04:05.870> stuck

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
literally just the same player but stuck

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.229 
literally just the same player but stuck
in<00:04:06.380> defense<00:04:06.739> with<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.980> different<00:04:07.310> name<00:04:07.340> or

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
in defense with a different name or

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.759 
in defense with a different name or
whatever<00:04:08.570> position<00:04:08.989> they're<00:04:09.260> planing<00:04:09.680> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
whatever position they're planing and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.600 
whatever position they're planing and
that<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:11.000> realism<00:04:11.360> for<00:04:11.630> me<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:12.310> nowhere<00:04:13.310> near

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
that the realism for me is nowhere near

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.479 
that the realism for me is nowhere near
the<00:04:13.910> standard<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.480> fee<00:04:14.840> for<00:04:15.080> 12<00:04:15.320> or<00:04:15.560> real<00:04:16.220> life

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the standard of fee for 12 or real life

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.390 
the standard of fee for 12 or real life
so<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:17.690> opinion<00:04:17.810> fifa<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.950> winner<00:04:19.160> on

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
so in my opinion fifa is the winner on

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.900 
so in my opinion fifa is the winner on
realism<00:04:20.330> second<00:04:21.230> part<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.650> entertainment<00:04:22.520> how

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
realism second part is entertainment how

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.090 
realism second part is entertainment how

to first got this demo it seemed like

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.420 
to first got this demo it seemed like

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
it was ok to be perfectly honest PES

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.550 
it was ok to be perfectly honest PES
2012<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.450> found<00:04:30.690> extremely<00:04:31.020> boring<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.530> play

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
2012 I found extremely boring to play

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.050 
2012 I found extremely boring to play
and<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.860> could<00:04:32.010> only<00:04:32.130> play<00:04:32.370> one<00:04:32.639> game<00:04:32.790> at<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.030> time

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
and I could only play one game at a time

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.730 
and I could only play one game at a time
and<00:04:33.510> I'd<00:04:33.660> pretty<00:04:33.870> much<00:04:33.990> done<00:04:34.350> put<00:04:34.560> they're

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
and I'd pretty much done put they're

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.879 
and I'd pretty much done put they're
playing<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.340> because<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.360> just<00:04:36.540> didn't<00:04:36.990> do

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
playing it because it just didn't do

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.620 
playing it because it just didn't do
anything<00:04:38.160> for<00:04:38.520> me<00:04:38.760> in<00:04:38.850> terms<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.300> how<00:04:39.600> it

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
anything for me in terms of how it

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.990 
anything for me in terms of how it
entertaining<00:04:40.230> me<00:04:40.530> every<00:04:41.340> game<00:04:41.490> seemed<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.910> be

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
entertaining me every game seemed to be

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
entertaining me every game seemed to be
the<00:04:42.120> same<00:04:42.330> pretty<00:04:43.080> much<00:04:43.230> in<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.440> games<00:04:43.680> were

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the same pretty much in the games were

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.120 
the same pretty much in the games were
slow<00:04:44.190> even<00:04:44.940> though<00:04:45.150> they<00:04:45.270> went<00:04:45.480> very<00:04:45.690> quickly

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
slow even though they went very quickly

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.250 
slow even though they went very quickly
it<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.669> that's<00:04:47.880> how<00:04:47.970> PES<00:04:48.510> for<00:04:48.630> 13<00:04:48.960> feels

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
it just and that's how PES for 13 feels

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.710 
it just and that's how PES for 13 feels
it<00:04:50.040> feels<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.370> same<00:04:50.639> as<00:04:50.820> fee<00:04:50.970> for<00:04:51.180> 12<00:04:51.389> in<00:04:51.510> terms

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
it feels the same as fee for 12 in terms

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.670 
it feels the same as fee for 12 in terms
of<00:04:51.810> entertainment<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:55.350> kept<00:04:55.590> me

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
of entertainment and it it kept me

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.020 
of entertainment and it it kept me
entertained<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:56.400> game<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.790> then<00:04:56.910> I<00:04:56.970> just

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
entertained for one game and then I just

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.310 
entertained for one game and then I just
dropped<00:04:57.360> off<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.750> didn't<00:04:58.050> want<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.200> play

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
dropped off it I didn't want to play

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.840 
dropped off it I didn't want to play
another<00:04:58.500> game<00:04:58.620> whereas<00:04:58.980> FIFA<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.669> play

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
another game whereas FIFA I can play

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.610 
another game whereas FIFA I can play
that<00:05:00.030> game<00:05:00.090> for<00:05:00.390> four<00:05:00.600> or<00:05:00.630> five<00:05:00.810> hours<00:05:00.990> on<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
that game for four or five hours on the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.340 
that game for four or five hours on the
truck<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.310> will<00:05:02.460> not<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.640> bored<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.970> it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
truck and I will not be bored of it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.990 
truck and I will not be bored of it
because<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.620> differs<00:05:04.980> from<00:05:05.100> game<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.370> game<00:05:05.580> and

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
because it differs from game to game and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.720 
because it differs from game to game and
it<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:06.240> seems<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.480> entertain<00:05:06.960> me<00:05:07.169> and<00:05:07.730> PES

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
it just seems to entertain me and PES

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.190 
it just seems to entertain me and PES
