00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 Hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.650
 I am always an aroma and today I will show you 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.350
 how to build in my industrial craft 2 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:47.400
 nuclear reactor and and finger start myself 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.790
 the reactor and its complements as well here 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.140
 this block which note 4 let's just say 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.129
 you yes what does it mean let's start 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.790
 do in principle is not difficult to put 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 the last 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 reactor itself and now just complementary 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.299
 your sister 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 here we are a little cube dumb 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.900
 it turns out 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 and for your own safety if we 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.080
 I certainly don’t guarantee that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.620
 were so one hundred percent that 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:29.110
 outside will deal in no case but all 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.010
 maybe you understand there are modes 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.620
 heart will blow up he will blow up on 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.880
 the distance will be one blocks and nothing 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.880
 scary sausage they happen so 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.370
 so here too 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.930
 almost finished our king tass box and 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.690
 on top I hurried 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.690
 means for us to have everything 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.159
 really good you need everything for doing it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.420
 a little bit of bright stage 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.789
 after the top you need so far for 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 today you have and she is hard 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.819
 it is necessary to fill completely from all sides 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.330
 absolutely and once again I will show such a function 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.360
 which I naturally found me the most I 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 Found him to return, well, more precisely to me 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.490
 prompted there and somehow I'm still on 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.600
 she only knows why or 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.410
 let's start needing birdies tablets 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.260
 have enjoyed 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.750
 and you need to put them in front of it 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.990
 sheer input / output 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.990
 the muscles 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 we are missing here 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:56.010
 aion and give and so take in the plate and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.940
 steel on the contrary for sale bu cars here 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.360
 thanks to them you will not evaporate 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.820
 water that is, we see that we have here 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.920
 usually just that is until the reactor will 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.920
 the water will not evaporate 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 and it seems almost ready 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.590
 You can put such a glass and I do not know 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.470
 how to do honestly others but i 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.720
 here is the sauce 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.270
 that is, to have our energy here 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 accumulated with us you know here I 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.300
 specially left a hole and I did not 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.920
 just to style 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.370
 means we need 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.240
 the usual lever here is our hearth it would be there 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.670
 turns on our actor 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.310
 here we need to open 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.400
 the test to fill it naturally and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.850
 You can fill in here because 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.650
 click important 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.409
 So 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.299
 I made the exit here but it was possible 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.909
 reaches you waiting 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.549
 but let's say I usually see from here how 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:18.930
 mancha wire where not allowed so 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.190
 so now we will need to fill 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.190
 themselves reactor 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.860
 and I will say that it will be enough 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.080
 hard to do 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.080
 it requires a lot of resources and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.800
 in the ordinary world and 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.710
 that is, not a game or will it be a system 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.460
 hard enough here I took as we 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.460
 we fill 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.340
 it means that now I will bring it all together 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.169
 well now i have filled in now we can 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.740
 replace again concentrate everything 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.169
 located and there can language and see 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.110
 before us here in a circle 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.010
 located fat yes and make it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.010
 just enough chase for go well this 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.650
 change as far as i know and water 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.199
 settlements that is but it is not particularly difficult 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.860
 and how to make it easy here 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.150
 many 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.530
 uranium is not as usual here with us 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.319
 we already have 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.250
 so well what can we have to close 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:31.280
 what we are trying to turn it on 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.939
 we look at her 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.210
 went at a breakneck pace and in fact 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:42.590
 Actually if we don’t even know 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.960
 not a pity because then cook like that 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.830
 let's say on 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.850
 choose mode 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.850
 we are here and 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.110
 two kids 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.569
 and we see that it charges 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.569
 simply and easily 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.240
 as you see me and dad mechanism i 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.840
 I really do not know what I have no sound 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.840
 usually there is sound when it works 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.050
 our reactor is working right now to me 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.050
 it is better 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.620
 so well, that's basically all of our reactor 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.990
 ready he successfully works all thanks 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.120
 for attention with you for armored 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.930
