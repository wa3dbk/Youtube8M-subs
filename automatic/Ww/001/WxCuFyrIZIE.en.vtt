00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.340 

when<00:00:00.179> I<00:00:00.210> was<00:00:00.359> thinking<00:00:00.480> about<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.930> physics

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
when I was thinking about the physics

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.350 
when I was thinking about the physics
behind<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.740> fountain<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.639> it<00:00:02.760> turns<00:00:03.000> out<00:00:03.179> that

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
behind a fountain and it turns out that

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.240 
behind a fountain and it turns out that
fountains<00:00:03.750> just<00:00:04.080> need<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.560> push

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
fountains just need a push

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.980 
fountains just need a push
they<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:05.670> need<00:00:05.910> pressure<00:00:06.390> or<00:00:06.690> something

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
they just need pressure or something

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.780 
they just need pressure or something
behind<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.529> push<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:08.069> water<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.730> we

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
behind it to push that water up so we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.820 
behind it to push that water up so we
get<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.059> beautiful<00:00:09.510> fountain<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> was

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
get this beautiful fountain so I was

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.379 
get this beautiful fountain so I was
thinking<00:00:11.190> once<00:00:11.370> again<00:00:11.550> how<00:00:11.820> could<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
thinking once again how could we make a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.020 
thinking once again how could we make a
fountain<00:00:12.799> using<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.860> balloon<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.670> let's<00:00:14.790> try<00:00:14.969> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
fountain using a balloon so let's try it

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.320 
fountain using a balloon so let's try it
out

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
out

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.240 
out
so<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:15.990> an<00:00:16.080> ordinary<00:00:16.320> bottle<00:00:16.680> gonna

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
so I have just an ordinary bottle gonna

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.660 
so I have just an ordinary bottle gonna
stick<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> balloon<00:00:17.760> inside<00:00:19.279> I'm<00:00:20.279> gonna<00:00:20.430> cover

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
stick a balloon inside I'm gonna cover

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.950 
stick a balloon inside I'm gonna cover
the<00:00:20.910> top<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:24.590> yeah<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.949> close<00:00:26.960> just

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the top of it yeah you get close just

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
the top of it yeah you get close just
like<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.250> try<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> blow

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
like that so now I'm gonna try to blow

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.139 
like that so now I'm gonna try to blow
up<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.449> balloon<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:34.530> happens<00:00:34.910> why<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
up the balloon what happens why is it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.619 
up the balloon what happens why is it
not<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.630> water<00:00:37.110> bottle<00:00:37.350> looks<00:00:38.160> empty<00:00:38.629> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
not this water bottle looks empty it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
not this water bottle looks empty it
turns<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.559> full<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> air<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
turns out that it is full of air and the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.049 
turns out that it is full of air and the
air<00:00:42.239> can't<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:43.020> anywhere<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> did<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
air can't go anywhere so what I did is I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.690 
air can't go anywhere so what I did is I
poked<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.750> hole<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.379> bottom<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
poked a little hole in the bottom just a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
poked a little hole in the bottom just a
tiny<00:00:48.000> tiny<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.719> hole<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
tiny tiny little hole here so that as I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
tiny tiny little hole here so that as I
blow<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> balloon<00:00:51.480> air<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.260> leave<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
blow up the balloon air can leave the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
blow up the balloon air can leave the
bottle<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> balloon<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.390> has

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bottle so that the balloon actually has

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
bottle so that the balloon actually has
some<00:00:54.809> space<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.559> let's<00:00:55.680> try<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.890> again

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
some space so let's try it again

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.359 
some space so let's try it again
ah<00:01:02.120> there<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.359> Wow<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
ah there we go Wow but we don't have a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
ah there we go Wow but we don't have a
water<00:01:05.640> balloon<00:01:05.850> yet<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.229> about

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
water balloon yet this is all about

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
water balloon yet this is all about
water<00:01:07.590> balloons<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.070> let's<00:01:08.220> add<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.549> water

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
water balloons so let's add some water

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
water balloons so let's add some water
I'm<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.869> fill<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.560> water

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I'm gonna fill this up with some water

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.920 
I'm gonna fill this up with some water
ooh<00:01:11.130> should<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.570> bowl

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.980 

so<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.590> nice<00:01:22.010> and<00:01:22.280> full<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.730> have<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.720> cap

somewhere oh the cat over here I'm gonna

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.100 
somewhere oh the cat over here I'm gonna
cap<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:31.640> remember<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:32.360> we<00:01:32.690> need<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.960> make

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
cap it and remember all we need to make

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.330 
cap it and remember all we need to make
a<00:01:33.140> fountain<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.620> what<00:01:34.450> pressure<00:01:35.450> push<00:01:36.410> so<00:01:37.100> this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
a fountain is what pressure push so this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.130 
a fountain is what pressure push so this
tiny<00:01:37.700> little<00:01:38.000> hole<00:01:38.270> that's<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.690> bottom<00:01:39.020> as

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
tiny little hole that's in the bottom as

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.320 
tiny little hole that's in the bottom as
soon<00:01:39.260> as<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.380> take<00:01:39.500> my<00:01:39.560> finger<00:01:40.160> off<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:40.640> air

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
soon as I take my finger off of it air

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.480 
soon as I take my finger off of it air
is<00:01:41.660> gonna<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:41.870> able<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.260> escape<00:01:42.920> four<00:01:43.280> push

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
is gonna be able to escape four push

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.940 
is gonna be able to escape four push
inches<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.210> inside<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.660> bottle<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.260> all

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
inches on inside that bottle and all

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.380 
inches on inside that bottle and all
that<00:01:46.100> air<00:01:46.220> that's<00:01:46.370> moving<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.970> bottle<00:01:47.210> is

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
that air that's moving in the bottle is

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.310 
that air that's moving in the bottle is
gonna<00:01:47.660> push<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.260> balloon<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.110> get

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
gonna push on the balloon and I get

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.640 
gonna push on the balloon and I get
found

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.990 

you<00:01:57.650> can<00:01:57.800> take<00:01:57.950> some<00:01:58.100> pictures<00:01:58.400> by<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.760> like<00:01:58.970> a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
you can take some pictures by is like a

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.740 
you can take some pictures by is like a
to<00:01:59.450> bigger<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.150> physics<00:02:02.510> of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
to bigger so that is the physics of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.550 
to bigger so that is the physics of
balloons<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.320> water<00:02:03.590> balloons<00:02:03.860> thank<00:02:04.369> you
