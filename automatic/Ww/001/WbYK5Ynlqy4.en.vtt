00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
expectations and when I don't achieve

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.430 
expectations and when I don't achieve
them<00:00:17.520> yeah<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.330> upset<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.110> that

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
them yeah I do get upset you know that

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.340 
them yeah I do get upset you know that
did<00:00:20.070> space<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:21.090> area<00:00:21.390> where<00:00:21.660> an

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
did space and that did area where an

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370 
did space and that did area where an
athlete<00:00:22.560> doesn't<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.220> want<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.520> get<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.380> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
athlete doesn't really want to get so I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560
