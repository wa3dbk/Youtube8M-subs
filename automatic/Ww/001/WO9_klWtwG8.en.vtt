00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.640 
which is a swimmer kind of fast so
that's<00:03:43.450> better<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.780> swim<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> little<00:03:44.260> faster<00:03:44.620> i

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
that's better you swim a little faster i

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.560 
that's better you swim a little faster i
think<00:03:44.860> but<00:03:44.980> not<00:03:45.190> too<00:03:45.310> much<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.420> can

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
think but not too much but you can

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.620 
think but not too much but you can
breathe<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.870> breathe<00:03:47.260> out<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.440> water<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.630> yeah

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
breathe in breathe out of water and yeah

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.600 
breathe in breathe out of water and yeah
you<00:03:49.810> come<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.410> can't<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:50.860> up<00:03:50.890> on<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.160> surface

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
you come you can't go up on the surface

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.100 
you come you can't go up on the surface
and<00:03:51.820> then<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.239> land<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.630> course<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:52.989> can

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
and then the land of course but you can

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.420 
and then the land of course but you can
just<00:03:53.290> morph<00:03:53.530> into<00:03:53.680> something<00:03:53.769> else<00:03:54.130> it

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
just morph into something else it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.070 
just morph into something else it
doesn't<00:03:54.790> take<00:03:54.910> any<00:03:55.090> energy<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> do<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.840> at<00:03:56.019> the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
doesn't take any energy to do it at the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.320 
doesn't take any energy to do it at the
moment<00:03:56.170> i<00:03:56.560> think<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.519> plan<00:03:57.730> for<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.150> future
