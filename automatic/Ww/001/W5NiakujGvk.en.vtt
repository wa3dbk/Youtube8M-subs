everybody<00:00:13.610> well<00:00:14.360> I<00:00:14.660> already<00:00:15.080> did<00:00:15.230> a<00:00:15.410> regular

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
everybody well I already did a regular

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.410 
everybody well I already did a regular
Christmas<00:00:16.279> song<00:00:16.580> for<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:16.939> more<00:00:17.119> advanced

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
Christmas song for the more advanced

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.660 
Christmas song for the more advanced
players<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.140> I<00:00:18.200> felt<00:00:19.039> like<00:00:19.160> there<00:00:19.490> should<00:00:19.640> be

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
players and I felt like there should be

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.370 
players and I felt like there should be
one<00:00:19.970> that's<00:00:20.210> more<00:00:20.330> accessible<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:20.930> players

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
one that's more accessible to players

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.920 
one that's more accessible to players
who<00:00:21.650> not<00:00:22.520> quite<00:00:22.790> at<00:00:22.910> that<00:00:22.939> experienced<00:00:23.570> level

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
who not quite at that experienced level

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.100 
who not quite at that experienced level
so<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.439> arranged<00:00:25.430> silent<00:00:26.000> night<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.180> very<00:00:26.660> simple

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
so I arranged silent night a very simple

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.630 
so I arranged silent night a very simple
format<00:00:27.529> it<00:00:27.770> shouldn't<00:00:28.010> probably<00:00:28.340> take<00:00:28.490> you

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
format it shouldn't probably take you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.060 
format it shouldn't probably take you
too<00:00:29.330> long<00:00:29.359> to<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:30.170> get<00:00:30.320> together<00:00:30.590> hopefully<00:00:30.859> if

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
too long to to get together hopefully if

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.970 
too long to to get together hopefully if
you'll<00:00:31.189> get<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.550> down<00:00:31.699> by<00:00:31.880> Christmas<00:00:32.890> but<00:00:33.890> it

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
you'll get it down by Christmas but it

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.500 
you'll get it down by Christmas but it
still<00:00:34.220> sounds<00:00:34.640> nice<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:34.879> it'll<00:00:35.420> probably

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
still sounds nice and it'll probably

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.020 
still sounds nice and it'll probably
sound<00:00:35.780> really<00:00:36.110> nice<00:00:36.230> on<00:00:36.530> an<00:00:36.650> acoustic<00:00:36.890> or<00:00:37.460> or

ok<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:51.289> it's<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.590> nice<00:01:51.770> easy<00:01:52.159> arrangement<00:01:52.820> that

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
ok so it's a nice easy arrangement that

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.480 
ok so it's a nice easy arrangement that
uses<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.299> lot<00:01:53.509> of<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.689> open<00:01:53.899> chords<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.890> some

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
uses a lot of the open chords and some

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.399 
uses a lot of the open chords and some
of<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.729> one<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.630> borrow<00:01:56.869> chords<00:01:57.259> we've

of the one of the borrow chords we've
already<00:01:57.560> done<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.159> hopefully<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:59.119> won't<00:01:59.270> be

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
already done so hopefully it won't be

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.880 
already done so hopefully it won't be
too<00:01:59.479> something<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.289> will<00:02:00.469> take<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.740> too

gives<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.610> good<00:04:37.789> sound<00:04:38.060> anyway<00:04:38.419> because<00:04:38.569> it

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
gives you a good sound anyway because it

for<00:04:58.639> this<00:04:58.699> particular<00:04:59.030> measure<00:04:59.360> but<00:05:00.050> you're

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
for this particular measure but you're

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.830 
for this particular measure but you're
gonna<00:05:00.289> strum<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.940> four<00:05:02.180> lowest<00:05:02.449> pitch

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
gonna strum the four lowest pitch

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.340 
gonna strum the four lowest pitch
strings<00:05:03.880> stopping<00:05:04.880> that<00:05:05.030> third<00:05:05.240> string

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
strings stopping that third string

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.120 
strings stopping that third string
so<00:05:07.100> we<00:05:07.220> got<00:05:07.340> one<00:05:07.550> three<00:05:07.910> three<00:05:07.940> two<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.980> then

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
so we got one three three two and then

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.520 
so we got one three three two and then
you<00:05:10.250> pick<00:05:10.490> two<00:05:11.180> again<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.810> first<00:05:12.170> string<00:05:12.380> the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
you pick two again the first string the

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.250 
you pick two again the first string the
second<00:05:12.860> from<00:05:12.980> on<00:05:13.100> Thursday

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
second from on Thursday

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.990 
second from on Thursday
then<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:15.070> do<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.220> full<00:05:15.490> stone<00:05:15.670> of<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.820> court

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
then you do a full stone of the court

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.070 
then you do a full stone of the court
again<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:16.390> time<00:05:16.450> go<00:05:16.690> all<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.960> way<00:05:16.990> to

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
again but this time go all the way to

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.430 
again but this time go all the way to
the<00:05:17.200> second<00:05:17.500> string<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.420> then<00:05:19.420> you<00:05:20.140> need<00:05:20.320> to

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
the second string and then you need to

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.580 
the second string and then you need to
lift<00:05:20.680> up<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.040> bottom<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.580> your<00:05:21.610> first<00:05:21.970> finger

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
that was held down that second string at

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.220 
that was held down that second string at
the<00:05:25.210> first<00:05:25.390> right<00:05:25.540> there<00:05:25.720> now<00:05:25.960> you<00:05:26.020> get<00:05:26.170> to

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
the first right there now you get to

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
the first right there now you get to
lift<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.470> up<00:05:26.530> you<00:05:26.650> don't<00:05:26.710> have<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.920> do<00:05:26.980> a<00:05:27.010> bar

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
lift it up you don't have to do a bar

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.660 
lift it up you don't have to do a bar
anymore

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
anymore

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.090 
anymore
that<00:05:28.600> way<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.930> allows<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.470> second<00:05:29.890> string<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
that way it allows that second string to

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.520 
that way it allows that second string to
ring<00:05:30.340> open<00:05:30.790> you're<00:05:31.630> still<00:05:31.900> holding<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.350> note

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
ring open you're still holding the note

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.300 
ring open you're still holding the note
here<00:05:32.950> though<00:05:33.160> and<00:05:33.420> then<00:05:34.420> come<00:05:34.690> down<00:05:34.720> across<00:05:35.310> to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
here though and then come down across to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.780 
here though and then come down across to
the<00:05:36.520> second<00:05:37.510> fret<00:05:37.750> third<00:05:38.740> string<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.280> then

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
the second fret third string and then

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.640 
the second fret third string and then
back<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.150> that<00:05:40.270> same<00:05:40.570> thing<00:05:41.080> like<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.320> first
