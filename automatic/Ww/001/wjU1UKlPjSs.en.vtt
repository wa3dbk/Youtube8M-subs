00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
didn't get to it all last year so it was

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
didn't get to it all last year so it was
a<00:03:06.060> good<00:03:06.240> day<00:03:06.420> who's<00:03:07.110> who's<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.530> best<00:03:07.710> today

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.330 
a good day who's who's the best today
well<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.480> my<00:03:10.410> group<00:03:10.680> Reapers<00:03:11.070> pretty

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
well I think my group Reapers pretty

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
well I think my group Reapers pretty
good<00:03:11.580> he<00:03:11.730> doesn't<00:03:12.480> miss<00:03:12.570> too<00:03:12.780> many<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.170> i'm

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
good he doesn't miss too many and i'm

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.660 
good he doesn't miss too many and i'm
guessing<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.560> other<00:03:13.710> group<00:03:13.920> RJ<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.340> pretty

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
guessing the other group RJ is pretty

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.150 
guessing the other group RJ is pretty
good<00:03:14.880> but<00:03:15.200> I'll<00:03:16.200> maybe<00:03:16.590> give<00:03:16.770> him<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> run<00:03:17.100> for

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
good but I'll maybe give him a run for

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.240 
good but I'll maybe give him a run for
the<00:03:17.400> money<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:18.030> day<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> who<00:03:19.830> are<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.130> sharing

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
