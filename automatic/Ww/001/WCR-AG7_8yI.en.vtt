well as the Fulton gold case now the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.279 
well as the Fulton gold case now the
grill<00:00:13.950> itself<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.640> available<00:00:15.090> in<00:00:15.930> two<00:00:16.080> types

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
grill itself is available in two types

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.940 
grill itself is available in two types
of<00:00:16.470> grill<00:00:16.730> one<00:00:17.960> which<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
of grill one which is what this one is a

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.240 
of grill one which is what this one is a
black<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.640> does<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.869> pzo<00:00:22.530> lighter<00:00:22.890> so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
black one does not have a pzo lighter so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
black one does not have a pzo lighter so
you<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> light<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> by<00:00:24.240> hand<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> red<00:00:26.039> one

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you have to light it by hand the red one

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
you have to light it by hand the red one
is<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.730> pzo<00:00:27.270> lighter<00:00:27.949> $20<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.840> figured<00:00:30.840> why

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
is a pzo lighter $20 more I figured why

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.340 
is a pzo lighter $20 more I figured why
buy<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:31.800> extra<00:00:32.329> twenty<00:00:33.329> bucks<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
buy the extra twenty bucks when you can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.119 
buy the extra twenty bucks when you can
light<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.469> yourself

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
light it yourself

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.610 
light it yourself
so<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.479> just<00:00:36.510> depends<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.199> you<00:00:37.409> want

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so really it just depends on if you want

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.509 
so really it just depends on if you want
pzo<00:00:38.519> later<00:00:38.729> if<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> take<00:00:39.569> along<00:00:40.519> one

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
pzo later if you want to take along one

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.709 
pzo later if you want to take along one
of<00:00:41.550> those<00:00:41.699> other<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.179> stick<00:00:42.510> lighter

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
of those other little stick lighter

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
of those other little stick lighter
things<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.449> we<00:00:45.449> used<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:45.749> have<00:00:46.670> or<00:00:47.670> we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
things and so we used to have or we

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.379 
things and so we used to have or we
still<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.179> actually<00:00:48.569> a<00:00:48.920> much<00:00:49.920> larger<00:00:50.429> Coleman

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
still do actually a much larger Coleman

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.869 
still do actually a much larger Coleman
grill<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.530> found<00:00:52.769> that<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.429> was<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.760> too

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
grill but we found that it was just too

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
grill but we found that it was just too
heavy<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.959> and<00:00:55.109> out<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.499> RV<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
heavy to take in and out of the RV and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
heavy to take in and out of the RV and
also<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.209> could<00:00:57.479> feed<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.899> 12<00:00:58.170> people<00:00:58.319> with

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
also you could feed about 12 people with

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.009 
also you could feed about 12 people with
it<00:00:58.799> now<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.459> here<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.209> that

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
it now this one here we don't have that

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.419 
it now this one here we don't have that
many<00:01:01.170> people<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.619> with<00:01:01.769> us<00:01:01.889> so<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.280> one

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
many people going with us so this one

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.340 
many people going with us so this one
here<00:01:02.549> will<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.879> three<00:01:03.269> or<00:01:03.479> even<00:01:03.600> four<00:01:03.869> people

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
here will do three or even four people

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.190 
here will do three or even four people
probably<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> size<00:01:06.900> for

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
probably so this is just right size for

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
probably so this is just right size for
us<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> we're<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.480> do<00:01:09.600> review<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.050> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
dollars its padded so it should protect

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.600

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
too you may or may not be interested in

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.950 
too you may or may not be interested in
one<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.350> say<00:01:31.640> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> griddle<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.690> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
one is say kind of a griddle like you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.230 
one is say kind of a griddle like you
would<00:01:34.080> make<00:01:34.230> pancakes<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.720> another<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
would make pancakes on and another is a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
would make pancakes on and another is a
more<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.360> great<00:01:39.630> where<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.140> maybe

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
more of a great where you would maybe

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.680 
more of a great where you would maybe
put<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.890> pot<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> pan<00:01:41.370> on<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.330> think<00:01:42.390> those

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
put a pot or a pan on and I think those

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.440 
put a pot or a pan on and I think those
actually<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:43.770> fit<00:01:44.760> inside<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> as

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
actually will will fit inside this as

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.950 
actually will will fit inside this as
well

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.690 

though<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.080> did<00:01:49.200> find<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.619> defect<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.549> long

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
though we did find one defect how long

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
though we did find one defect how long
the<00:01:50.790> Coleman<00:01:51.180> been<00:01:51.330> around<00:01:51.540> 100<00:01:51.720> years<00:01:52.020> maybe

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the Coleman been around 100 years maybe

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.710 
the Coleman been around 100 years maybe
seems<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.460> made<00:01:53.880> millions<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.509> grills

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
seems like they made millions of grills

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.670 
seems like they made millions of grills
but<00:01:56.000> we<00:01:57.000> never<00:01:57.270> giving<00:01:57.900> any<00:01:58.020> washers<00:01:58.440> for

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
but we never giving any washers for

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
but we never giving any washers for
these<00:01:58.830> screws<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> put<00:01:59.880> these

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
these screws and you got to put these

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.920

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
bottom of this so maybe I planted a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.499 
bottom of this so maybe I planted a
