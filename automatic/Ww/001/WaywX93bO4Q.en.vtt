00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.860
 Good evening everyone often mentions that life should have a waste 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.889
 I really think so 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.270
 But the tools we usually use 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.450
 There must be no waste 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.590
 To create a uniform and easy-to-use appliance 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:30.800
 National has a laboratory called Module Corner 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:35.150
 All if you is given the floor if the wall is called the module Kola will have been divided into square 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.260
 And in that place where you do normal casual action 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:43.520
 I took pictures with a special camera 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 And this is an attempt to break it down later and eliminate waste 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 Even after cleaning, it will be very convenient after the vacuum cleaner is born 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.600
 Now it's easier but how can a cleaner be used? 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.250
 This is the point 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:06.980
 For example, even if there is only one switch of vacuum cleaner 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.820
 So even if you have a single job to turn on the switch below 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:16.560
 I have to move my body a lot like this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.369
 So we want to take a look is there in this National vacuum cleaner High Clean 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.110
 Where is this high clean switch attached 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.230
 We are attached to the hand 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 Because you can switch on and off at hand 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.210
 There is no need to crouch on this one again 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 It is an extension pipe, but this is also depending on the place to clean 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.250
 You can expands or shrinks depending on the height of the back of the person to steer the other If this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.440
 I'm not tired 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.800
 In addition to the suction port would put water and back and forth even though falling is dangerous Harrier pin 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.900
 A permanent magnet is attached 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:02:00.730
 Also There is a easy to Makoto in such a condition clean-up of the code of finished cleaning 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:06.760
 Of course there is a country with a strong power to inhale dust and quietness of the sound 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.350
 This is not a problem anymore. If it's a vacuum cleaner, it's easy to use. 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.450
 National vacuum cleaner 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 I would like to decide high clean 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.240
 paipan 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.770
 Yes yes Okay Ya 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.980
 It is said that no 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.830
 It is a place to enter 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.320
 car nice nice nice 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.320
 Then I am sorry until this mountain statue
