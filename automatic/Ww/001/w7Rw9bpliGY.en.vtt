the<00:03:59.200> upgrade<00:03:59.530> sucks<00:03:59.830> about<00:03:59.980> this<00:04:00.250> one<00:04:00.459> on

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the upgrade sucks about this one on

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.479 
the upgrade sucks about this one on
damage<00:04:01.540> rate<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.020> fire<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.709> then<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.280> flips

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
damage rate of fire and then it flips

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.360 
damage rate of fire and then it flips
uniquely<00:04:04.270> just<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.350> makes<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.770> ever

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
uniquely just because it makes you ever

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.640 
uniquely just because it makes you ever
realize<00:04:06.880> I'm<00:04:07.450> gonna<00:04:07.630> shove<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.140> weapons<00:04:08.470> once

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
realize I'm gonna shove the weapons once

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.800 
realize I'm gonna shove the weapons once
again<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:11.440> RPG<00:04:12.340> aspect<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.630> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
again so this is the RPG aspect this is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.120 
again so this is the RPG aspect this is
the<00:04:13.930> norm

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:32.810
