00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and I'll link you to that thread and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.630 
and I'll link you to that thread and
next<00:01:37.920> year<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
next year you're going to need for that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
next year you're going to need for that
so<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.350> basically<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> got<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> do

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so this is basically what you got to do

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
so this is basically what you got to do
figure<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.729> once<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.689> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
figure this out once you have this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
figure this out once you have this
information<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.770> move<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:45.030> here

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
information we can move on so from here

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.870 
information we can move on so from here
I'm<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.689> ahead<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.280> hit<00:01:47.280> power<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm going to go ahead and hit power to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.830 
I'm going to go ahead and hit power to
go<00:01:48.090> into<00:01:48.299> fastboot<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:50.390> go<00:01:51.390> down<00:01:51.600> here

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
go into fastboot and then go down here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
go into fastboot and then go down here
it<00:01:51.930> says<00:01:51.960> reboot<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> go<00:01:53.130> ahead<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.460> hit

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it says reboot and go ahead and hit

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
it says reboot and go ahead and hit
reboot<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.229> we're<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
reboot so what we're going to be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.950 
reboot so what we're going to be
removing<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.329> right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> screen

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
is how we're going to do this you can

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.980 
is how we're going to do this you can
also<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:30.730> some<00:04:30.910> commands<00:04:31.270> from<00:04:31.450> your<00:04:31.600> computer

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.820 
showed before by powering off and doing
it<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.390> way<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:22.660> I'm<00:05:22.810> going<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:22.960> go<00:05:23.080> reboot<00:05:23.680> to

it that way so I'm going to go reboot to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.690 
it that way so I'm going to go reboot to
bootloader<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:27.130> should<00:05:27.280> be<00:05:27.370> fairly
