back to input X I did just have a quick
play<00:02:21.930> around<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.650> out<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
play around with it so this is out of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.210 
play around with it so this is out of
the<00:02:25.920> camera<00:02:26.370> I'm<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> quickly

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the camera I'm just going to quickly

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.000 
the camera I'm just going to quickly
play<00:02:29.220> around<00:02:29.459> with<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> see<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.239> can<00:02:30.450> get

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
play around with it to see what can get

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.800 
play around with it to see what can get
now<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.340> said<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.790> probably<00:02:32.940> about<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.300> stop

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
now as I said it's probably about a stop

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.949 
now as I said it's probably about a stop
to<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.380> stop<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.860> half<00:02:35.010> underexposed<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.150> so

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
to a stop and a half underexposed and so

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.750 
to a stop and a half underexposed and so
I'm<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.440> boost<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> exposure<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I'm just going to boost the exposure a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
I'm just going to boost the exposure a
little<00:02:39.209> bit<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.690> quite<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.989> stop<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.920> maybe

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
little bit not quite a stop but maybe

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.699 
little bit not quite a stop but maybe
just<00:02:41.660> sort<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.690> half<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.050> stop<00:02:43.319> something<00:02:43.560> like

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
just sort of half a stop something like

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.600 
just sort of half a stop something like
that<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.420> give<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:47.580> more

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that just to give it a bit more

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
that just to give it a bit more
brightness<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> whole<00:02:48.569> image<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
brightness in the whole image now you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.580 
brightness in the whole image now you
can<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.590> down<00:02:49.769> here<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:51.150> wall<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.720> quite<00:02:52.470> in

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
can see down here this wall is quite in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.390 
can see down here this wall is quite in

shadow and the Sun was behind me when I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.130 
shadow and the Sun was behind me when I
took<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.360> was<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> big<00:02:57.780> rainstorm

coming over the valley so with our new
sliders<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.390> we've<00:03:03.599> got<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
highlights and the shadows I can

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.300 
highlights and the shadows I can
actually<00:03:06.150> bring<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.200> highlights<00:03:07.620> all<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
way down to get rid of some of the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.460 
way down to get rid of some of the
bright<00:03:10.830> parts<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.489> sky<00:03:11.730> here<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:13.380> at<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
bright parts in the sky here but at the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.250 
bright parts in the sky here but at the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
same time I can bring the shadows up and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
those shadows right out I still got a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.520 
those shadows right out I still got a
bit<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.620> shadow<00:03:28.859> down<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.630> from<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> leg<00:03:30.989> of

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
bit of shadow down here from the leg of

bit of shadow down here from the leg of
the<00:03:31.680> tripod<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:33.329> from<00:03:33.480> where<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:34.430> but

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the tripod and but from where it was but

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.410 
the tripod and but from where it was but
not<00:03:35.670> that's<00:03:36.480> really<00:03:36.810> pulled<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.380> area<00:03:37.769> back

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
not that's really pulled that area back

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.599 
not that's really pulled that area back
and<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.630> also<00:03:39.780> see<00:03:40.109> in<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.579> trees<00:03:41.579> down

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
and you can also see in the trees down

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.449 
and you can also see in the trees down
here<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.359> we're<00:03:42.510> also<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.930> shadow<00:03:43.459> is

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
here that we're also in shadow is

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.330 
here that we're also in shadow is
brought<00:03:44.790> them<00:03:44.970> out<00:03:45.500> now<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.130> in

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
brought them out now to do that in

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.039 
brought them out now to do that in
lightly<00:03:47.940> three<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.329> would<00:03:48.510> have<00:03:48.630> had<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.019> have

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
lightly three I would have had to have

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.770 
lightly three I would have had to have
use<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.530> fill<00:03:49.889> light<00:03:50.160> slider<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.600> would

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
use the fill light slider but that would

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.259 
use the fill light slider but that would
have<00:03:51.959> increased<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:53.639> fill<00:03:53.880> light<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
have increased the fill light on the

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.170 
have increased the fill light on the
whole<00:03:54.450> image<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.639> want<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.880> increase

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
whole image and I don't want to increase

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
whole image and I don't want to increase
fill<00:03:57.989> light<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.440> part<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.950> certainly

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
fill light on this part and I certainly

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.559 
fill light on this part and I certainly
don't<00:03:59.370> want<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.609> increase<00:03:59.850> it<00:04:00.030> anymore<00:04:00.359> on<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
don't want to increase it anymore on the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.210 
don't want to increase it anymore on the
sky<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.100> shadow<00:04:02.370> slider<00:04:03.139> is<00:04:04.139> really<00:04:04.560> sort

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
sky so this shadow slider is really sort

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.569 
sky so this shadow slider is really sort
of<00:04:05.280> them<00:04:05.660> helped<00:04:06.660> out<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:07.340> that's<00:04:08.340> done

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
of them helped out there that's done

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.599 
of them helped out there that's done
exactly<00:04:08.910> what<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.209> wanted<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:10.549> now<00:04:11.549> you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
exactly what I wanted it to do now you

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.340 
exactly what I wanted it to do now you
can<00:04:11.880> see<00:04:12.090> we've<00:04:12.239> got<00:04:12.389> our<00:04:12.510> whites<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:13.170> you

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
can see we've got our whites here you

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.039 
can see we've got our whites here you
can<00:04:13.500> just<00:04:13.530> play<00:04:13.889> around<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:15.049> obviously

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
can just play around with this obviously

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.259 
can just play around with this obviously
going<00:04:16.289> too<00:04:16.530> far<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.100> blows<00:04:17.789> all<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.000> whites

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
going too far and blows all the whites

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.409 
going too far and blows all the whites
out<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.720> don't<00:04:18.900> want<00:04:19.049> them<00:04:19.169> blown<00:04:19.380> out<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:20.419> can

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
out I don't want them blown out I can

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.050 
out I don't want them blown out I can
probably<00:04:21.599> leave<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.289> maybe<00:04:23.099> just<00:04:23.280> boosted<00:04:24.030> a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
probably leave that maybe just boosted a

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.490 
probably leave that maybe just boosted a
tiny<00:04:24.390> bit

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
tiny bit

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.770 
tiny bit
same<00:04:26.310> with<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.520> blacks<00:04:29.150> I'm<00:04:30.150> going<00:04:30.420> to<00:04:30.510> bring

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780

it<00:04:30.930> down<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.590> little<00:04:32.190> bit<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.490> don't<00:04:32.760> want<00:04:32.910> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
it down a little bit I don't want to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.790 
it down a little bit I don't want to
introduce<00:04:33.510> all<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.110> black<00:04:34.320> back<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
introduce all that black back in the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.670 
introduce all that black back in the
shadows<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.460> do<00:04:35.580> want<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:37.110> get<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.290> bit<00:04:37.470> more

going<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.270> take<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.420> too<00:04:45.750> far<00:04:49.460> it's<00:04:50.460> not

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
going to take it too far it's not

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.060 
going to take it too far it's not
looking<00:04:50.640> too<00:04:50.850> bad<00:04:51.050> now<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.110> clarity<00:04:52.680> slider

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
looking too bad now the clarity slider

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.360 
looking too bad now the clarity slider
it's<00:04:53.850> one<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.180> use<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.390> lot<00:04:55.220> quite<00:04:56.220> often

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
it's one that I use a lot quite often

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.190 
it's one that I use a lot quite often
enlightened<00:04:57.000> three<00:04:57.210> won't<00:04:57.450> want<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.750> take<00:04:57.870> it

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
enlightened three won't want to take it

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.840 
enlightened three won't want to take it
too<00:04:58.410> far<00:04:58.440> because<00:04:58.890> it<00:04:59.130> would<00:04:59.280> start<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.730> look

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
too far because it would start to look

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.409 
too far because it would start to look
quite<00:05:00.030> nasty<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.750> but<00:05:01.680> in<00:05:02.340> this<00:05:02.880> version<00:05:03.120> now

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
quite nasty and but in this version now

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.690 
quite nasty and but in this version now
you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.750> pretty<00:05:03.990> much<00:05:04.110> boost<00:05:05.040> up<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.550> one

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
you can pretty much boost up to one

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.430 
you can pretty much boost up to one
hundred<00:05:05.730> percent<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:08.100> get<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:08.430> kind<00:05:08.700> of

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
hundred percent and you get this kind of

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.159 
hundred percent and you get this kind of
fake<00:05:10.440> HDR<00:05:11.100> look<00:05:11.280> from<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.000> which<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.480> pretty

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
fake HDR look from it which is pretty

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.520 
fake HDR look from it which is pretty
cool<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.970> so<00:05:17.970> yeah<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.419> don't<00:05:18.690> necessarily

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
cool and so yeah you don't necessarily

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.280 
cool and so yeah you don't necessarily
need<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.160> shoot<00:05:20.600> dedicated<00:05:21.600> 800<00:05:21.720> meters

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
need to shoot dedicated 800 meters

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.720 
need to shoot dedicated 800 meters
anymore<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.710> can<00:05:22.830> get<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.100> kind<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.430> feel

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
anymore you can get that kind of feel

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
anymore you can get that kind of feel
just<00:05:24.600> with<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.930> clarity<00:05:25.320> slider<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:26.600> which<00:05:27.600> i

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
just with the clarity slider and which i

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.020 
just with the clarity slider and which i
think<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:27.990> quite<00:05:28.140> good<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.470> mean<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.800> do<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.790> fair

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
think is quite good I mean I do a fair

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.219 
think is quite good I mean I do a fair
bit<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.270> HDR<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:31.940> purely<00:05:32.940> because<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.870> don't

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
bit of HDR and purely because I don't

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.170 
bit of HDR and purely because I don't
always<00:05:34.410> carry<00:05:34.620> my<00:05:34.740> only<00:05:35.070> filters<00:05:35.790> among<00:05:36.030> with

got a fig barely decent image of it and

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.860

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
I'll just boosts the saturation slightly

I'll just boosts the saturation slightly
boost<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.530> vibrants<00:06:05.220> not<00:06:05.370> too<00:06:05.550> much<00:06:05.700> up<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.479> bit

boost the vibrants not too much up a bit

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.060 
boost the vibrants not too much up a bit

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
flowing out just as I said when you

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.889 
flowing out just as I said when you
import<00:07:20.159> your<00:07:20.249> images<00:07:20.610> now<00:07:20.789> be<00:07:21.120> aware<00:07:21.180> that<00:07:21.659> all

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
these numbered values will be at zero

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.899 
these numbered values will be at zero
and<00:07:24.089> not<00:07:25.050> like<00:07:25.229> before<00:07:25.559> when<00:07:25.740> someone's<00:07:26.279> at<00:07:26.430> 25

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
and not like before when someone's at 25

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.239 
and not like before when someone's at 25
or<00:07:27.120> 150<00:07:27.629> so<00:07:28.439> that's<00:07:28.589> what<00:07:28.800> it<00:07:28.889> looks<00:07:29.069> like

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:29.249 
or 150 so that's what it looks like

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:30.730 
or 150 so that's what it looks like
after<00:07:29.459> I<00:07:29.639> just<00:07:29.819> fitted<00:07:30.120> with<00:07:30.269> it<00:07:30.360> for<00:07:30.509> a<00:07:30.539> bit

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740 
after I just fitted with it for a bit

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.259

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:36.269 
and we said it sees really is quite a

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:45.980
