00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.050 
and it can really set them off in some
cases<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.410> important<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.460> keep<00:02:23.640> control

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
cases so it's important to keep control

interact you know after class is over
the<00:02:39.630> other<00:02:39.750> thing<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.050> said<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.410> there

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the other thing you said is that there

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.040 
the other thing you said is that there
were<00:02:40.710> dogs<00:02:40.920> wearing<00:02:41.220> muzzles<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.780> class

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
speaking there are two main types of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.650 
speaking there are two main types of
group<00:03:25.650> dog<00:03:26.010> training<00:03:26.340> classes<00:03:26.640> there<00:03:27.360> are

group dog training classes there are

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
group dog training classes there are

training<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.510> then<00:03:30.930> there<00:03:31.230> are<00:03:31.260> classes<00:03:31.980> that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
training and then there are classes that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.670 
training and then there are classes that
rely<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.460> more<00:03:32.730> traditional<00:03:32.960> approaches<00:03:33.960> and

rely on more traditional approaches and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.950 
rely on more traditional approaches and
they<00:03:34.830> will<00:03:35.160> usually<00:03:35.460> require<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.390> use<00:03:36.510> a
