00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.919
 I will listen to everything you listen to 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.139
 have said 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.849
 I will kill you, I will kill you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.219
 kill because we are not guilty for 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 i will let you time your house in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.640
 to bring order and your peace with 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 to close god 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 The Calvary The Crusade is one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.019
 symbol that michael the pain 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 others for their sake 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.550
 who looks to death in the face of who 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.570
 Turns those to the ones death 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 Promise now Jesus has done that 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 Many people associate many Christians 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.270
 with the calvary the last seven 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.079
 days in the life of jesu especially his 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.239
 crucifixion 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 The movie is about seven days in the life 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 a priest in which he is with the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.360
 challenge 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 either to love his life for others 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.649
 or to let go of them 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 it's about a good man of the against 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 the stream is swimming and trying its 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 ideal to stay loyal not necessarily 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 the ideology of the church a man of the so 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 he believes in the good of the church 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740
 sometimes the meaning of things 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 misunderstands 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 we see here in principle the same 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.939
 people in the gospel also in 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 this little town 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.810
 because no matter where they commit as encounter 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 the same people as jesus 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 met is people who make an effort 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.790
 people make mistakes and people 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.290
 those who are looking for are sure of that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.479
 there is a god, father 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 I'm serious, I'm asking that because 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 Personally, I doubt that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 just make a faith crisis through him 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.200
 symbolizes a beacon of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:46.020
 hope and they mock him for it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 solve it further to let shine 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.790
 sometimes that's almost impossible, but he 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.340
 keeps going 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.049
 Can you get rid of him what did you say to her? 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 I did not say anything , Jane was 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.070
 fonda james wears two vouchers 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.320
 on one shoulder the burden of one 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.990
 broken church on the other the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 Burden of a broken world and I think 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.520
 somehow he tries to heal both 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 tried with the one damaged 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.060
 system the other to repair ours 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.630
 time is and father is preaching yours too 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.420
 The End 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.190
 I thought this one point 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.260
 figure can not stand anymore 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.590
 but then there was this wonderful one 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.660
 sentence the marie-josÃ©e croze just says almost 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.100
 in angel's same manner as you with 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.170
 faced with a terrible loss 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.890
 will and still believe in yours 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.140
 preserved 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.110
 That helps him in a moment in which he 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 that's the bottom line for that 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.660
 Most people are afraid of it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.610
 death is not more than that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:57.510
 everything is just that's it too 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:59.670
 lose so much disbelief 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.079
 decency and the question whether it 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.140
 Things are not forgiven 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.380
 There may be some criminal charges 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.239
 against irregularities 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.810
 but we all know that very well 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.799
 not happening no does not expect any 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.739
 punishment on a first class 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.870
 my position 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.609
 that's impossible, that's big 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.799
 ask and the film is also very much 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.890
 captivating and interesting way 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.870
 Give me father if I have sinned 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.590
 then they just talk ten 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.540
 Father's sins were greater 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.940
 There is a lot of sin in this city and he 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.030
 but he knows that too 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.690
 Contrary to sin virtue is the power 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 the goodness 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.380
 and not enough virtues you have 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.950
 quite right 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.510
 what would be the number one i find 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.790
 forgiveness is hard to underestimate 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.650
 he is certainly not a perfect 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.480
 ultimately, he believes in forgiveness 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.110
 love and hope and that you are in the end 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.760
 triumph on sunday you are dead 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.220
 from october 23 in the cinema I think that too 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.090
 much talked about sins and not 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.090
 enough about virtue 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.269
 I think forgiveness is difficult 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.269
 underrated
