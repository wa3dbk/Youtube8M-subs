00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.180
 against the two plan view running men note that you are not the 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.340
 Steelers are indeed Germany's number one series series returns 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.709
 back in the meanwhile seventh part of the main series 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.129
 1 watch exclusive game scenes 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.129
 and we'll take a look at what has changed this time 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.119
 and that is quite a lot the settlers 7 works differently than part 6 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.320
 the central village square is passé 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 instead, there is again spreading that they come 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.260
 why are data not right next to the houses 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620
 Now the new building is moved in the foot 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.030
 they put a reason building on the map here for example a mountain hut 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.040
 as usual, it needs a road connection 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.670
 the actual production companies can be exclusively at this 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.440
 Reason Buildings dock a maximum of 3 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.390
 at the mountain hut, for example, these are mines and quarries by a click 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.820
 on the green arrow »the selection menu is fulfilled you decide 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.360
 for a cultivation and then come the artisans can be cured and rooms 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.459
 suitable hut 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.789
 Build right next to it like a warehouse 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 because the number of porters on the roads now depends on how many 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.970
 Questions we own 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.390
 There were five different types of customers 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.189
 next comes her home 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.649
 Housing is one of the limiting factors in the settlers 7 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.510
 their population counted 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.410
 Politicians consume a bed 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.500
 but even if he never uses that in the end 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.940
 because needs have no doubt any other than fidgeting could be 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 very well 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.570
 and so it looks strong for their initial solution to a qualitative one 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 has grown 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890
 here unique houses and production plants together 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 There are also some special buildings 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.560
 for example the church 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.580
 in this new place 7 settlers in three stages become the settlers 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:50.630
 educated 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.710
 we are calling for three here in munich and promptly with those contracts here 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.350
 to escape to the church 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.299
 the clergy know just how to best the omnipotent Ulbricht 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.979
 the main cause is well invested because the priests are you 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.900
 Key to new technologies, they sent their monks in 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.729
 such monastery of which it is on most cards of a title 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.419
 then research improvements in a technology barometer 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.220
 For example, the decision was made for the scarecrow by ours 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.219
 Grow farmers more effectively in the future 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 The em-sixth settlers part are also the cards of the settlers 7 in sectors 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.819
 divided and sometimes quite a few as the survey of these 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.350
 Multiple map shows 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.400
 Anyone who wants to expand their settlement must take possession of adjacent sectors 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 and that works only by force 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.249
 Similarly, the settlers 7 again sits a military system, however 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.100
 much easier knitted than in the two predecessors 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.040
 The soldiers felt there were two of them in the tavern 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.129
 the knees and the animals of course that applies 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.559
 freshly hired soldiers are assigned to a general 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 only under whose leadership 7 they go to war 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.959
 that is very easy 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.430
 General click target sector select and everything else is running 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 automatically 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.579
 as soon as your mini- army encounters the opposing defense 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.439
 the troops gather for battle 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.269
 At the same time, as a player, they are at least up to date in terms of development 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.470
 watch damn 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 the musketeers fire that then the bikini melee buy everything 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.940
 usual Fitch animates later in the game there are also Pavone die and cannons 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.740
 In addition to sheer mass, the composition of her family is the decisive factor 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.740
 about victory or defeat 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.800
 who were not nominated 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.660
 Clear that even the settlers 7 back on track to the damage itself for example 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.660
 in the production processes here in the weaving mill 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.119
 In general, the life can be seen even in the beautiful 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.550
 landscaped and detailed landscape 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.830
 In this view, you can also show up with three Race Imboden 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.520
 to observe the neighbor sectors and trade routes 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.490
 Incidentally, the building in the foreground is a semi-finished cathedral 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.310
 in one of the so-called event sectors where tasks are on them 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.939
 waiting 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.040
 for example, to supply enough building material around the cathedral 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.650
 complete 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.430
 and where we are just finishing the settlers 7 is doing good 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.820
 Progress and should end of March 2010
