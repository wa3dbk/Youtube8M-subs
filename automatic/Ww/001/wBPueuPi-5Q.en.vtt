and she's really cool app for today it's

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459 
and she's really cool app for today it's
called<00:00:11.370> shrink<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.809> allows<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> do

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
called shrink and it allows you to do

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.570 
called shrink and it allows you to do
what<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.309> now<00:00:15.080> this<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
what you see right now this is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.689 
what you see right now this is
iconoclasm<00:00:17.580> 10<00:00:18.359> by<00:00:18.539> 10<00:00:18.810> overlap<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.699> before

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
iconoclasm 10 by 10 overlap and before

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.730 
iconoclasm 10 by 10 overlap and before
it<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:20.970> very<00:00:21.330> very<00:00:21.689> difficult<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.289> find<00:00:22.529> an

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it was very very difficult to find an

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.980 
it was very very difficult to find an
icon<00:00:23.220> set<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.730> could<00:00:23.910> support<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.510> not

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
icon set that could support it and not

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
icon set that could support it and not
have<00:00:25.019> overlapping<00:00:25.920> icons<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have overlapping icons and you can see I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.439 
have overlapping icons and you can see I
have<00:00:27.500> very<00:00:28.500> very<00:00:28.890> tiny<00:00:29.250> icons<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> glass

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
have very very tiny icons in the glass

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.290 
have very very tiny icons in the glass

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
Squire theme that are able to fit this

Squire theme that are able to fit this
type<00:00:33.660> set<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> tweak<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> called<00:00:35.309> shrink

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
type set now the tweak is called shrink

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.250 
type set now the tweak is called shrink
because<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> allows<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
because what it allows you to do is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.979 
because what it allows you to do is
change<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.190> size<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:38.879> icons<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.570> this

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
change the size of your icons in this

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.340 
change the size of your icons in this
really<00:00:40.320> simple<00:00:40.700> settings<00:00:41.700> tab<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.350> them

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
really simple settings tab and make them

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
really simple settings tab and make them
anywhere<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.370> twenty-five<00:00:44.910> percent<00:00:45.059> their

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
anywhere from twenty-five percent their

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.459 
anywhere from twenty-five percent their
original<00:00:45.930> size<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:47.010> their<00:00:47.550> full<00:00:47.820> size<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
original size to their full size so

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
original size to their full size so
right<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.160> half<00:00:50.610> their<00:00:50.940> size

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
right now i have it on half their size

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.260 
right now i have it on half their size
and<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> best<00:00:53.129> part<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and the best part about this is that it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.080 
and the best part about this is that it
not<00:00:54.780> only<00:00:54.980> works<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.190> themes<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> also

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
not only works with themes but it also

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.950 
not only works with themes but it also
works<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.719> iconoclasm<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.949> infinite<00:00:59.399> ox<00:00:59.579> so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
works with iconoclasm in infinite ox so

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.070 
works with iconoclasm in infinite ox so
on<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.230> dock<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.010> i<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.399> multiple<00:01:03.080> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
on my dock down here i have multiple you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.719 
on my dock down here i have multiple you
can<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.320> your<00:01:04.350> scrolling<00:01:04.799> doc<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.489> up

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
can have your scrolling doc you have up

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.719 
can have your scrolling doc you have up
to<00:01:06.000> 10<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> bottom<00:01:07.049> which<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> sort

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to 10 in the bottom which would be sort

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.580 
to 10 in the bottom which would be sort
of<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.799> icon<00:01:10.799> set<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> also

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
of like the icon set up up here and also

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
of like the icon set up up here and also
these<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.799> screenshots<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> would

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
these are screenshots so that I would

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
these are screenshots so that I would
not<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> lot<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> restraint<00:01:17.450> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
not have to do a lot of restraint you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050 
not have to do a lot of restraint you
would<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.840> also<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.430> iconoclasm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
would can also have the iconoclasm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
would can also have the iconoclasm
setups<00:01:21.720> where<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.229> multiple<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:24.090> these

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
setups where you have multiple of these

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.649 
setups where you have multiple of these
shrink<00:01:24.780> icons<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> these<00:01:25.830> setups<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.659> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
shrink icons in these setups and it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
shrink icons in these setups and it
looks<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.409> neat<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.490> only<00:01:29.729> issue

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
looks very very neat now the only issue

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.140 
looks very very neat now the only issue
I've<00:01:30.450> come<00:01:30.750> across<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.650> Maya

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
I've come across and this in Maya

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
I've come across and this in Maya
covering<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.390> application<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
covering of this application is this

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
covering of this application is this
right<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.329> live<00:01:37.020> clock

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
right here and this is the live clock

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.730 
right here and this is the live clock
icon<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.490> glass<00:01:38.790> car<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
icon from glass car and what it the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.929 
icon from glass car and what it the
issue<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.490> suppose<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:44.520> create

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
issue is I suppose is that to create

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.510 
issue is I suppose is that to create
this<00:01:45.090> icon<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.720> need<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.170> certain<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this icon you need a certain I like a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
this icon you need a certain I like a
certain<00:01:48.000> picture<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> clock<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
certain picture and then the clock to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
certain picture and then the clock to
rotate<00:01:50.189> around<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.210> shrinking<00:01:51.689> method

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
rotate around it so the shrinking method

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
rotate around it so the shrinking method
does<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.229> work<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.430> every<00:01:53.759> other<00:01:53.850> icon

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
does not work but for every other icon

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
does not work but for every other icon
whether<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.990> Cydia<00:01:55.350> app<00:01:55.649> store<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.280> default

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
whether it's Cydia app store or default

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.719 
whether it's Cydia app store or default
it<00:01:57.719> shrinks<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.390> keeps<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.570> theme<00:02:00.979> but<00:02:01.979> from

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it shrinks it and keeps a theme but from

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.950 
it shrinks it and keeps a theme but from
there<00:02:02.939> let's<00:02:03.119> go<00:02:03.299> ahead<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.570> show<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.840> some

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there let's go ahead and show you some

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
there let's go ahead and show you some
of<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> UI<00:02:04.320> let's<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.710> ahead<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
of the UI let's go ahead and get out of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
of the UI let's go ahead and get out of
pictures<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.659> you'll<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.110> some<00:02:07.320> times<00:02:07.530> past

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pictures and you'll see some times past

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.969

your pictures or whatever it'll come out
looking<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> little<00:03:38.600> weird<00:03:39.019> that's<00:03:39.799> why

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
looking a little weird that's why

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.530 
looking a little weird that's why
because<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.519> going<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.790> shrinks<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
because it going to shrinks to the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.020 
because it going to shrinks to the
center<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:41.930> then<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.560> bottom<00:03:42.860> but<00:03:43.850> on

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
center and then to the bottom but on

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.729 
center and then to the bottom but on
this<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.660> pretty<00:03:44.900> simple<00:03:45.170> app<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:45.680> a

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
this this is a pretty simple app but a

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.460 
this this is a pretty simple app but a
very<00:03:46.010> very<00:03:46.250> useful<00:03:46.459> one<00:03:46.959> finally<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.110> can<00:03:48.260> have

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
very very useful one finally we can have
