dr. Alex young thank you for joining us
thank<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> sunspot<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.350> why

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
thank you so what is a sunspot and why

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.640 
thank you so what is a sunspot and why
why<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.850> special<00:00:21.080> well<00:00:22.080> sunspots

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
why is this one so special well sunspots

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
why is this one so special well sunspots
are<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.119> regions<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.779> really

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
are these regions of really really

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.470 
are these regions of really really
intense<00:00:25.500> magnetic<00:00:26.070> field<00:00:26.340> they're<00:00:26.849> massive

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
intense magnetic field they're massive

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
intense magnetic field they're massive
areas<00:00:27.840> they're<00:00:28.080> slightly<00:00:28.619> cooler<00:00:29.039> than<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
areas they're slightly cooler than the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.479 
areas they're slightly cooler than the
surrounding<00:00:29.519> Sun<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.480> appear<00:00:30.840> dark<00:00:31.489> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
surrounding Sun so they appear dark this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.850 
surrounding Sun so they appear dark this
one<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.270> great<00:00:33.960> interest<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.500> us<00:00:34.649> because

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
one is of great interest for us because

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
one is of great interest for us because
it's<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> largest<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:36.000> we've<00:00:36.030> seen<00:00:36.239> in

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's the largest one we've seen in

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's the largest one we've seen in
almost<00:00:36.930> 24<00:00:37.890> years<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.450> ten<00:00:39.870> times

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
almost 24 years it's more than ten times

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
almost 24 years it's more than ten times
the<00:00:40.440> size<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> earth<00:00:43.460> why<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the size of the earth why do we want to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.350 
the size of the earth why do we want to
learn<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> sunspot<00:00:46.489> well<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
learn more from the sunspot well this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.900 
learn more from the sunspot well this
one<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.079> interesting<00:00:49.350> because

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
one is really interesting because

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
one is really interesting because
generally<00:00:50.910> sunspots<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.960> size<00:00:52.289> produce

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
generally sunspots of this size produce

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.060 
generally sunspots of this size produce
a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> activity<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.770> direct

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
a lot of activity that can have direct

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
a lot of activity that can have direct
impact<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> us<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.360> earth

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
impact on us here at earth

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.790 
impact on us here at earth
this<00:00:58.440> particular<00:00:59.219> one<00:01:00.079> though<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.320> produced

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this particular one though it's produced

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
this particular one though it's produced
some<00:01:02.039> activity<00:01:02.579> has<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.730> produced<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> kind

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
some activity has not produced the kind

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.770 
some activity has not produced the kind
of<00:01:03.809> activity<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.409> expected<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.570> been

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
of activity we expected so this has been

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
of activity we expected so this has been
a<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.200> interesting<00:01:07.320> puzzle<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.310> scientists

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a very interesting puzzle for scientists

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
a very interesting puzzle for scientists
to<00:01:08.909> study<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> better

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to study so that we can better

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.510 
to study so that we can better
understand<00:01:11.460> sunspots<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.180> general<00:01:13.340> will<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
understand sunspots in general will it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
understand sunspots in general will it
affect<00:01:14.820> us<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.540> earth

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
affect us here on earth

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760 
affect us here on earth
well<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.420> sunspots<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.689> throw<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.200> huge

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
well the sunspots can throw out huge

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
well the sunspots can throw out huge
blasts<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> light<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.090> call<00:01:21.330> solar<00:01:21.630> flares

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
blasts of light we call solar flares

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
blasts of light we call solar flares
sometimes<00:01:22.710> big<00:01:23.369> blobs<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.909> material<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
sometimes big blobs of material it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
sometimes big blobs of material it
doesn't<00:01:25.320> impact<00:01:25.860> us<00:01:26.070> directly<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
doesn't impact us directly but all of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
doesn't impact us directly but all of
this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.070> electromagnetic<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> nature<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this is electromagnetic in nature and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
this is electromagnetic in nature and
therefore<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.509> impacts<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.409> technology

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
therefore it impacts our technology

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.719 
therefore it impacts our technology
sometimes<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.299> disrupt<00:01:33.680> communications

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
sometimes it can disrupt communications

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
sometimes it can disrupt communications
it<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.060> cause<00:01:36.509> problems<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.140> GPS<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.009> even

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it can cause problems with GPS and even

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.780 
it can cause problems with GPS and even
impact<00:01:39.119> our<00:01:39.509> power<00:01:39.900> grids<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> storms<00:01:41.640> are

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
impact our power grids if the storms are

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.109 
impact our power grids if the storms are
strong<00:01:42.030> enough<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> NASA<00:01:44.310> doing<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
strong enough what is NASA doing to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
strong enough what is NASA doing to
understand<00:01:45.630> sunspots<00:01:46.170> better<00:01:46.439> well<00:01:47.430> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
understand sunspots better well in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
understand sunspots better well in
particular<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.659> several<00:01:49.170> spacecraft

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
particular we have several spacecraft

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.999 
particular we have several spacecraft
such<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> Solar<00:01:51.119> Dynamics<00:01:51.420> Observatory

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory
which<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> looking<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> Sun<00:01:54.090> 24<00:01:54.720> hours<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
which is looking at the Sun 24 hours a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.310 
which is looking at the Sun 24 hours a
day<00:01:55.200> providing<00:01:55.979> great<00:01:56.939> amounts<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> data<00:01:57.840> for

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
day providing great amounts of data for

day providing great amounts of data for
us<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> study<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.670> also<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.390> huge

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
us to study it we also have this huge

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.920 
us to study it we also have this huge
fleet<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.530> spacecraft<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.060> studying<00:02:03.450> not

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
fleet of spacecraft that is studying not

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
fleet of spacecraft that is studying not
just<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> Sun<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.219> also<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.759> sun's
