it's<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.540> bit<00:00:51.629> easier<00:00:51.839> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.229> the<00:00:52.409> turns

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it's a little bit easier to do the turns

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
it's a little bit easier to do the turns
if<00:00:53.070> there's<00:00:53.250> no<00:00:53.400> rotation<00:00:54.089> or<00:00:54.390> traveling<00:00:55.110> if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.450 

sometimes<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.560> more<00:01:08.620> comfortable<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.310> do

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
sometimes it's more comfortable to do

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.540 
sometimes it's more comfortable to do
that<00:01:09.610> with<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> feet<00:01:10.060> slightly<00:01:10.540> apart<00:01:14.550> more

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
turn to lead the term there's a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.240 
turn to lead the term there's a
connection<00:01:23.710> from<00:01:24.040> my<00:01:24.100> lap<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.600> betty's<00:01:26.250> we're

connection from my lap to betty's we're

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.850 
connection from my lap to betty's we're
clicking<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.820> here<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:29.050> i<00:01:29.080> can<00:01:29.200> start<00:01:29.650> her

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
clicking in here so that i can start her

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.470 
clicking in here so that i can start her
body<00:01:30.100> turning<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.820> then<00:01:30.940> she<00:01:31.120> follows

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
body turning and then she follows

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.510 
body turning and then she follows
through<00:01:31.510> on<00:01:31.780> her<00:01:32.080> own<00:01:32.230> right<00:01:32.770> now<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.400> you

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
through on her own right now if you

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.130 
through on her own right now if you
notice<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.850> first<00:01:34.060> time<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.390> took<00:01:34.510> five<00:01:34.780> steps

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
notice the first time it took five steps

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.290 
notice the first time it took five steps
or<00:01:35.380> five<00:01:35.530> beats<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.980> second<00:01:36.340> time<00:01:36.520> 60<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.060> just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
or five beats the second time 60 I just

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.540 
or five beats the second time 60 I just
let<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> ladies<00:01:37.840> go<00:01:37.990> at<00:01:38.140> their<00:01:38.290> own<00:01:38.320> pace<00:01:38.620> when

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
let the ladies go at their own pace when

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.219 
let the ladies go at their own pace when
we<00:01:39.670> get<00:01:39.820> more<00:01:39.940> comfortable<00:01:40.210> i<00:01:40.570> might<00:01:40.750> force<00:01:41.020> it

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
we get more comfortable i might force it

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.320 
we get more comfortable i might force it
to<00:01:41.350> four<00:01:41.590> or<00:01:41.979> eight<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.760> know<00:01:42.880> whatever<00:01:43.210> I'm
