00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I'm going to talk about straightening

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.480 
I'm going to talk about straightening
teeth<00:00:15.210> first<00:00:15.990> we'll<00:00:16.170> start<00:00:16.320> off<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.920> why<00:00:17.310> we

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.970 
teeth first we'll start off with why we
should<00:00:17.699> straighten<00:00:18.150> teeth<00:00:18.680> most<00:00:19.680> people

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
should straighten teeth most people

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.980 
should straighten teeth most people
throw<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.400> teeth<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:21.529> cosmetic<00:00:22.529> reasons

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
throw them teeth for cosmetic reasons

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.589 
throw them teeth for cosmetic reasons
but<00:00:24.990> apart<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.490> be

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
but apart from that there there can be

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
but apart from that there there can be
other<00:00:27.599> reasons<00:00:27.990> why<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.320> might<00:00:28.470> why<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.490> might

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
other reasons why we might why we might

other reasons why we might why we might
need<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> realign<00:00:30.630> teeth<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> straighten

need to realign teeth and straighten

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
need to realign teeth and straighten
them<00:00:33.170> sometimes<00:00:34.170> people<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.190> four<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
them sometimes people see four so out of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
them sometimes people see four so out of
alignment<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.050> bite<00:00:37.200> together<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
alignment and when they bite together it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.610 
alignment and when they bite together it
can<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.040> quite<00:00:38.309> traumatic<00:00:39.260> also<00:00:40.260> by<00:00:40.440> having

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
can be quite traumatic also by having

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.030 
can be quite traumatic also by having
straighter<00:00:41.100> teeth<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> clean<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> media

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
straighter teeth you can clean the media

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
straighter teeth you can clean the media
and<00:00:44.040> therefore<00:00:44.520> reducing<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> chance<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.559> any

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and therefore reducing the chance of any

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.209 
and therefore reducing the chance of any
decay<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.670> gum<00:00:48.090> disease

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
decay and gum disease

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
decay and gum disease
so<00:00:50.219> let's<00:00:50.520> move<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:52.829> ways

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so let's move on to the different ways

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
so let's move on to the different ways
of<00:00:53.250> straighten<00:00:53.699> teeth<00:00:53.910> most<00:00:54.690> people

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
of straighten teeth most people

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.270 
of straighten teeth most people
recognize<00:00:56.000> normal<00:00:57.000> metal<00:00:57.960> braces<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
recognize normal metal braces as a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
recognize normal metal braces as a
traditional<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.629> moving<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> aligning

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
traditional way of moving and aligning

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
traditional way of moving and aligning
teeth<00:01:02.930> also<00:01:03.930> known<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.530> orthodontics<00:01:05.250> okay<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
teeth also known as orthodontics okay so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.870 
teeth also known as orthodontics okay so
there<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.990> types<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:08.119> two<00:01:09.119> main<00:01:09.420> types<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
there are two types of two main types of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
there are two types of two main types of
braces<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.420> wear<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
braces that one can wear there are the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
braces that one can wear there are the
fixed<00:01:14.729> metal<00:01:15.150> braces<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:17.670> there's<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
fixed metal braces but also there's a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
fixed metal braces but also there's a
removable<00:01:18.930> metal<00:01:19.409> brace<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.310> your

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
removable metal brace and your

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
removable metal brace and your
orthodontist<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.360> advise<00:01:21.689> which<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
orthodontist will advise which one is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
orthodontist will advise which one is
ideal<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> sometimes<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ideal for you and sometimes it's a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080 
ideal for you and sometimes it's a
mixture<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.670> depends

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
mixture of the two and it really depends

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
mixture of the two and it really depends
on<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.540> sort<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:30.950> alignment<00:01:31.950> or

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
on what sort of alignment or

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
on what sort of alignment or
disalignment<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.110> one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
disalignment if you like that that one

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.639 
disalignment if you like that that one
has

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
has

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.349 
has
but<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.680> think<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.009> key<00:01:37.219> here<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:37.969> have<00:01:38.149> to

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
but I think the key here is you have to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.060 
but I think the key here is you have to
visit<00:01:38.539> your<00:01:38.869> orthodontist<00:01:39.799> have<00:01:40.039> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
visit your orthodontist have a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.840 
visit your orthodontist have a
consultation<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.409> then<00:01:42.490> after<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.549> discussion

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
consultation and then after a discussion

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.940 
consultation and then after a discussion
with<00:01:44.030> him<00:01:44.329> or<00:01:44.539> her<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.869> can<00:01:45.049> decide<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.469> on

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
with him or her you can decide on on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.050 
with him or her you can decide on on
what<00:01:46.310> type<00:01:46.549> of<00:01:46.579> brace<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.689> good<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:48.560> yourself

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
what type of brace is good for yourself

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.700 
what type of brace is good for yourself
another<00:01:50.060> way<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.479> moving<00:01:51.049> teeth<00:01:51.530> or

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
another way of moving teeth or

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.399 
another way of moving teeth or
straightening<00:01:52.219> teeth<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:53.299> using<00:01:53.810> these<00:01:53.990> clear

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
straightening teeth is using these clear

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.679 
straightening teeth is using these clear
aligners<00:01:56.950> as<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.219> can<00:01:58.399> see<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.819> is<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.209> what

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
aligners as you can see this is not what

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.649 
aligners as you can see this is not what
most<00:02:00.020> people<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:00.619> recognize<00:02:00.829> as<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:02.179> metal

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
most people would recognize as a metal

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.789 
most people would recognize as a metal
brace<00:02:03.459> however<00:02:04.459> they<00:02:05.329> can<00:02:05.659> do<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.200> very<00:02:06.500> similar

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
brace however they can do a very similar

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.380 
brace however they can do a very similar
job<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.750> they<00:02:08.929> will<00:02:09.170> move<00:02:09.410> teeth<00:02:09.769> and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
job in that they will move teeth and

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.120 
job in that they will move teeth and
straighten<00:02:11.390> teeth<00:02:11.569> what<00:02:12.410> we've<00:02:12.560> got<00:02:12.739> here<00:02:12.950> is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
straighten teeth what we've got here is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.380 
straighten teeth what we've got here is
a<00:02:13.160> very<00:02:13.670> very<00:02:13.760> simple<00:02:14.420> example<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.140> how<00:02:15.250> a

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
a very very simple example of how a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.819 
a very very simple example of how a
clear<00:02:17.390> aligner<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.370> used<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:20.829> straighten

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
clear aligner can be used to straighten

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.190 
clear aligner can be used to straighten
teeth<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:24.530> model<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.610> see<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.959> two

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
teeth this model as you can see the two

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.550 
teeth this model as you can see the two
front<00:02:27.530> teeth<00:02:27.709> are<00:02:28.450> fairly<00:02:29.450> spaced<00:02:30.170> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
front teeth are fairly spaced and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.550 
front teeth are fairly spaced and
splayed<00:02:30.890> outwards<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.239> after<00:02:35.720> wearing<00:02:35.989> the
