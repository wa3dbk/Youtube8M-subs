to<00:03:34.880> what<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.120> me<00:03:35.269> with<00:03:35.510> was<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:36.310> goblin

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
to what like me with was it a goblin

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.509 
to what like me with was it a goblin
style<00:03:37.640> thing<00:03:37.940> was<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.330> golem<00:03:39.310> starving<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
style thing was it a golem starving and

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.289 
style thing was it a golem starving and
it<00:03:41.450> was<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.680> really<00:03:43.070> fun<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.000> try<00:03:44.180> and

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
it was just a really fun to try and

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.620 
it was just a really fun to try and
guess<00:03:44.510> as<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.870> what<00:03:44.959> sort<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.230> unit<00:03:45.620> was<00:03:45.890> and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
guess as to what sort of unit was and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.930 
guess as to what sort of unit was and
yeah<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.799> spent<00:03:48.799> most<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.100> yesterday<00:03:49.250> thinking

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
yeah I spent most of yesterday thinking

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670 
yeah I spent most of yesterday thinking
and<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.570> be<00:03:50.690> honest<00:03:50.900> I'd<00:03:50.989> read<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> few<00:03:51.350> people

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and to be honest I'd read a few people

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.830 
and to be honest I'd read a few people
getting<00:03:51.980> at<00:03:52.100> gargoyle<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.269> thought<00:03:53.570> yeah

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
getting at gargoyle and I thought yeah

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.229 
getting at gargoyle and I thought yeah

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
that actually sounds quite quite like an

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.300 
that actually sounds quite quite like an
air<00:03:56.360> tanker<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:56.930> sounds<00:03:57.290> like<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.440> good

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
air tanker that sounds like a good

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.670 
air tanker that sounds like a good

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
lewd me in any way if their air defenses

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.260 
lewd me in any way if their air defenses
to<00:04:57.650> centralize<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.610> think<00:04:58.940> it's<00:04:59.090> going<00:04:59.180> to

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
to centralize so I think it's going to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.760 
to centralize so I think it's going to
really<00:04:59.540> change<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.960> ergonomics<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.590> game

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
really change the ergonomics of the game

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.320 
really change the ergonomics of the game
and<00:05:01.010> just<00:05:01.460> for<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.700> fact<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:01.970> you've<00:05:02.150> got<00:05:02.300> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
and just for the fact that you've got a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.750 
and just for the fact that you've got a
sort<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:02.930> an<00:05:03.020> air<00:05:03.110> tank<00:05:03.440> now<00:05:03.710> as<00:05:03.890> well<00:05:04.100> that's

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
sort of an air tank now as well that's

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.420 
sort of an air tank now as well that's
really<00:05:05.150> going<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.680> make<00:05:06.680> some<00:05:06.860> difference<00:05:07.070> and

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
really going to make some difference and

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.850 
really going to make some difference and
really<00:05:07.640> evolved<00:05:08.540> air<00:05:08.900> raiding<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.500> think<00:05:09.710> even

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
really evolved air raiding I think even

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.620 
really evolved air raiding I think even
on<00:05:10.040> dragon<00:05:10.400> attacks<00:05:10.670> having<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:10.970> tank<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.420> go<00:05:11.510> in

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
on dragon attacks having a tank to go in

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.570 
on dragon attacks having a tank to go in
and<00:05:11.750> distract<00:05:12.500> while<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.800> Dragons<00:05:13.160> clean<00:05:13.430> up

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
and distract while the Dragons clean up

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.790 
and distract while the Dragons clean up
and<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:14.480> know<00:05:14.600> i<00:05:14.630> mean<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.900> i<00:05:15.410> think<00:05:15.710> it's

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
and you know i mean it i think it's

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.070

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.550 
going to be a real sort of strat
strategic<00:05:18.890> sort<00:05:19.130> of<00:05:20.140> addition<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.350> game

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
strategic sort of addition to the game

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.500 
strategic sort of addition to the game
