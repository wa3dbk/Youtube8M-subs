everybody I just want to thank all the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.500 
everybody I just want to thank all the
people<00:00:07.830> came<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.849> my<00:00:08.970> very<00:00:09.240> first

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
people came out and to my very first

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.419 
people came out and to my very first
live<00:00:09.900> ustream<00:00:10.170> show<00:00:10.590> where<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> spent<00:00:11.340> about

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
live ustream show where I spent about

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.330 
live ustream show where I spent about
five<00:00:11.759> hours<00:00:11.790> assembling<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> storm<00:00:12.809> Raven

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
five hours assembling the storm Raven

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
five hours assembling the storm Raven
and<00:00:14.340> here's<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.599> pretty<00:00:15.960> much<00:00:16.139> dried<00:00:16.440> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and here's it's all pretty much dried it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.400 
and here's it's all pretty much dried it
i'm<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.029> working<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.600> magnetizing

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
i'm just now working on magnetizing

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
i'm just now working on magnetizing
weapons<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.279> i<00:00:20.340> left<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> cockpit<00:00:20.939> off

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
weapons and see i left the cockpit off

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.779 
weapons and see i left the cockpit off
so<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.390> paint<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> interior<00:00:22.519> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> didn't

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so I can paint the interior and I didn't

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
so I can paint the interior and I didn't
finish<00:00:23.970> put<00:00:24.269> finish<00:00:24.660> fully<00:00:25.350> something<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
finish put finish fully something to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.259 
finish put finish fully something to
turn<00:00:25.980> either<00:00:26.160> secondly<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> interior<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
turn either secondly the interior that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.259 
turn either secondly the interior that
and<00:00:28.340> probably<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.760> too<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and probably I can get too much on the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.089 
and probably I can get too much on the
interior<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.260> we'll<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:31.949> how<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
interior of it but we'll see how that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.470 
interior of it but we'll see how that
goes<00:00:32.660> here's<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> storm<00:00:33.989> Raven<00:00:35.239> 10<00:00:36.239> inches

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
goes here's the storm Raven 10 inches

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
goes here's the storm Raven 10 inches
long<00:00:36.719> 11<00:00:37.230> inch<00:00:37.380> wingspan<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.160> significantly

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
long 11 inch wingspan so significantly

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
long 11 inch wingspan so significantly
bigger<00:00:38.969> than<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> rhino<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> course<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
bigger than a rhino and of course I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
bigger than a rhino and of course I
build<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.309> landing<00:00:44.579> gear<00:00:44.700> down<00:00:44.910> just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
build over the landing gear down just

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.369 
build over the landing gear down just
because<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.960> nice<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.260> convenient<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:49.050> very

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because it's nice and convenient it very

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.600 
because it's nice and convenient it very
nicely<00:00:49.590> snaps<00:00:50.129> onto<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.640> flying<00:00:50.910> base<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
nicely snaps onto the flying base so it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
nicely snaps onto the flying base so it
doesn't<00:00:53.820> even<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.210> magnetized

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
doesn't even need to be magnetized

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
doesn't even need to be magnetized
that's<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> great<00:00:55.440> center<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> gravity

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that's got a great center of gravity

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.350 
that's got a great center of gravity
right<00:00:56.340> where<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.640> put<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.000> flying<00:00:57.600> stand

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.580 

so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:11.750> guess<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.140> else<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> say

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so I guess there's not much else to say

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
so I guess there's not much else to say
I'm<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.220> gonna<00:01:14.340> show<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.530> angles<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I'm just gonna show some more angles you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.830 
I'm just gonna show some more angles you
won't<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> soap<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> entirety<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.910 

connecting<00:01:24.840> point<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> dreadknot<00:01:25.619> was

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
connecting point for a dreadknot was

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580 
connecting point for a dreadknot was
actually<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> winch<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.590> magnet

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually a winch and a little magnet

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
actually a winch and a little magnet
thing<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.060> little

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
thing and that's that's this little

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600 
thing and that's that's this little
piece<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.570> plastic<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.610> that's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
piece of plastic right here that's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.469 
piece of plastic right here that's
supposed<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> dread-nots

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
supposed to be where the dread-nots

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
supposed to be where the dread-nots
attaches<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.110> dry<00:01:34.439> grid<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
attaches so dry grid that just kind of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.280 
attaches so dry grid that just kind of
dangles<00:01:35.670> underneath<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> stormraven<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
dangles underneath the stormraven I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.740 
dangles underneath the stormraven I
guess<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> flies<00:01:37.890> through<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.159> air<00:01:38.750> kind

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
guess as it flies through the air kind

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.270 
guess as it flies through the air kind
of<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:41.060> interesting<00:01:42.060> ride<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> guess

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
of kind of a interesting ride I guess

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
of kind of a interesting ride I guess
assembly<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> model<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.899> incredibly<00:01:45.899> easy<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
assembly the model was incredibly easy I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.639 
assembly the model was incredibly easy I
will<00:01:46.500> admit<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.600> only<00:01:48.750> parts<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> real<00:01:49.439> pain

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
will admit the only parts is a real pain

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.050 
will admit the only parts is a real pain
to<00:01:49.890> clean<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.310> far<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.549> mould<00:01:50.729> lines<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
to clean as far as mould lines is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.190 
to clean as far as mould lines is
landing<00:01:51.450> gear<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> got<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> get

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
landing gear because you got to get

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.940 
landing gear because you got to get
inside<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.070> hydraulics<00:01:54.649> but<00:01:55.649> everything

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
inside the hydraulics but everything

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.819 
inside the hydraulics but everything
else<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.399> super<00:01:57.240> simple<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:58.590> pieces

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
else was just super simple these pieces

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.410 
else was just super simple these pieces
here<00:01:59.159> underneath<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> wings<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> where<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
here underneath the wings and where the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
here underneath the wings and where the
wings<00:02:00.600> connect<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> cowlings<00:02:01.680> over<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
wings connect to the cowlings over the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.249 
wings connect to the cowlings over the
engines<00:02:02.490> um<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:04.130> perfect<00:02:05.130> fit<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
engines um is a perfect fit so it

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.300 
engines um is a perfect fit so it
there's<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> recess<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there's a recess in there that's the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.690 
there's a recess in there that's the
same<00:02:08.580> exact<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.970> an<00:02:09.119> exact<00:02:09.450> fit<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> piece

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
same exact as an exact fit for the piece

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
same exact as an exact fit for the piece
so<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.730> goes<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.840> perfect

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
so it goes in there with perfect

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.790 
so it goes in there with perfect
alignment

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
alignment
