00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
at Figure 40 you know it shows um
looking<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> plasma<00:01:43.979> screen<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.399> shows<00:01:44.610> half

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
looking at a plasma screen it shows half

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.389 
looking at a plasma screen it shows half
the<00:01:45.149> screen<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.990> blue<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> half<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> black<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the screen is blue and half is black and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
the screen is blue and half is black and
in<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> case<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.290> you've<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> little

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
in this case I see you've got a little

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
in this case I see you've got a little
side<00:01:50.040> note<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.430> says<00:01:50.670> lower<00:01:51.000> buffer<00:01:51.479> or

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
faulty the one on the right hand it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
faulty the one on the right hand it
shows<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> top<00:01:55.860> part<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.250> black<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.790> says

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
shows the top part is black it says

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.350 
shows the top part is black it says

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
upper faulty buffer board now my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.639 
upper faulty buffer board now my
experience<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> buffer

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
experience was that when the buffer

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.050 
experience was that when the buffer
board<00:02:01.829> goes<00:02:02.009> bad<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> caused<00:02:02.790> everything

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
board goes bad that it caused everything

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.639 
board goes bad that it caused everything
to<00:02:03.210> shut<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.170> not<00:02:04.350> always<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
to shut down but that's not always the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.330 
to shut down but that's not always the
case<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:06.170> depends<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.680> engineering<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
case is it depends on the engineering of

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
case is it depends on the engineering of

the<00:02:10.410> nature<00:02:10.620> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> problem<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.850> bumpy

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the nature of the problem you know bumpy

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
the nature of the problem you know bumpy
boards<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.600> develop<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.260> many<00:02:13.440> different

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
boards can develop so many different

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
boards can develop so many different
problems<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.120> could<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:15.900> cause

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
problems that could actually cause

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.130 
problems that could actually cause
detection<00:02:17.310> circuits<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.910> engage<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.960> either

detection circuits to engage and either

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.950 
detection circuits to engage and either
shut<00:02:19.530> down<00:02:19.560> or<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:21.030> could<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.390> cause<00:02:21.630> the

shut down or it could just cause the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
buffer board not to function at all but

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
buffer board not to function at all but
the<00:02:24.240> other<00:02:24.420> circuits<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:24.990> function<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the other circuits will function you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010 
the other circuits will function you
know<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> y-sustain<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:27.360> let's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
know for like the y-sustain or let's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.360 
know for like the y-sustain or let's
take<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.350> example<00:02:28.410> if<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.130> upper

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
take for example if it's the upper

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
take for example if it's the upper
buffer<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:29.850> bad<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.810> lonely<00:02:31.080> buffalo

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
buffer that's bad the lonely buffalo

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.770 
buffer that's bad the lonely buffalo
still<00:02:31.710> works<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.730> y-sustain<00:02:32.940> board<00:02:33.390> will

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
still works and the y-sustain board will

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.110 
still works and the y-sustain board will
still<00:02:34.020> produce<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.160> picture<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.790> you'll<00:02:35.940> have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
still produce the picture so you'll have

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.390 
still produce the picture so you'll have
just<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.540> lower<00:02:36.750> half<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> screen<00:02:37.620> that's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
just a lower half of the screen that's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220 
just a lower half of the screen that's
functioning<00:02:38.970> normally<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> top<00:02:39.780> half<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
functioning normally in the top half the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.220 
functioning normally in the top half the
screen<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:41.160> completely<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:42.020> okay

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
screen that's completely off okay

and<00:02:49.350> you've<00:02:49.830> got<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> little<00:02:50.220> note<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.400> says

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and you've got a little note that says

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.360 
and you've got a little note that says
right<00:02:50.970> address<00:02:51.360> board<00:02:51.990> faulty<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.040> call<00:02:53.250> it

you've got quite a few by the way I

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.610 
you've got quite a few by the way I
don't<00:03:24.630> know<00:03:24.690> how<00:03:24.810> many<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> really

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
don't know how many but I really

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.020 
don't know how many but I really
appreciate<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:26.160> because<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.790> sort<00:03:26.940> of

the<00:03:27.120> thing<00:03:27.330> I'm<00:03:27.480> seeing<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.870> get<00:03:28.050> different

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the thing I'm seeing you get different

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.260 
the thing I'm seeing you get different
symptoms<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.400> time<00:03:29.610> are<00:03:29.760> looking<00:03:30.120> at<00:03:30.239> a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
symptoms this time are looking at a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.390 
symptoms this time are looking at a
vertical<00:03:30.780> black<00:03:31.440> line<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:32.070> up<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.340> down

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
you follow the voltage what was it the

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.020 
you follow the voltage what was it the
voltages<00:05:58.720> as<00:05:59.020> as<00:05:59.349> they<00:05:59.590> were<00:05:59.820> printed<00:06:00.820> on<00:06:00.910> the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
voltages as as they were printed on the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.790 
voltages as as they were printed on the
label<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.539> the<00:06:01.570> top<00:06:01.720> part<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.349> TV<00:06:02.530> they

would often got like a metallic label
and<00:06:06.010> now<00:06:06.099> what<00:06:06.699> if<00:06:06.789> you're<00:06:06.940> off<00:06:07.090> by<00:06:07.120> a<00:06:07.330> bolt<00:06:07.599> or

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
and now what if you're off by a bolt or

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.580 
and now what if you're off by a bolt or
two<00:06:07.960> does<00:06:08.139> it<00:06:08.289> matter

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
two does it matter

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.100 
two does it matter
I<00:06:08.740> mean<00:06:09.010> of<00:06:09.639> all<00:06:09.849> the<00:06:09.910> two<00:06:10.240> won't<00:06:10.570> matter<00:06:10.840> too

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
I mean of all the two won't matter too

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.580 
I mean of all the two won't matter too
much<00:06:11.139> but<00:06:11.530> if<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.680> go<00:06:11.979> past<00:06:12.340> like<00:06:12.669> 10<00:06:12.940> 15<00:06:13.590> 20

dangerous okay I've seen some some

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.969 
dangerous okay I've seen some some
panels<00:06:24.669> that<00:06:24.849> were<00:06:25.030> like<00:06:25.330> 50<00:06:25.900> volts<00:06:26.260> over<00:06:26.530> what

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
panels that were like 50 volts over what
