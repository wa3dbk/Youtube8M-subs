00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.620 
and if you have dark hair or long hair
it<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.490> makes<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.760> pretty<00:02:21.060> easy<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
it actually makes it pretty easy to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.140 
it actually makes it pretty easy to
conceal<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.550> sensor

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
conceal now this here this is a sensor

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.710 
conceal now this here this is a sensor
that<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.570> would<00:02:30.990> put<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.410> head<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that you would put on your head and you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.810 
that you would put on your head and you
want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.020> put<00:02:34.230> directly<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> skin<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.550> not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
want to put directly on the skin and not

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.030 
want to put directly on the skin and not
on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.450> hair<00:02:36.690> otherwise<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.470> might<00:02:37.590> mess<00:02:37.800> up

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
on the hair otherwise it might mess up

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.000 
on the hair otherwise it might mess up
so<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.650> can<00:02:40.980> cover<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.850> up<00:02:42.270> though<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.590> then

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
so you can cover that up though and then

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.180 
so you can cover that up though and then
it<00:02:44.280> also<00:02:44.520> has<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> clip<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.870> also<00:02:46.350> has<00:02:46.740> sensors

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it also has a clip that also has sensors

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.980 
it also has a clip that also has sensors
on<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:47.820> going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.030> put<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.630> your

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
on it that you're going to put on your

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:59.270 
on it that you're going to put on your
left<00:02:49.740> ear<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.390> don't<00:02:57.750> even<00:02:57.900> see<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.230> B<00:02:58.560> but

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
left ear so you don't even see the B but

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.100 
left ear so you don't even see the B but
you<00:02:59.640> know<00:02:59.760> if<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.030> don't<00:03:00.209> have<00:03:00.390> any<00:03:00.570> bangs<00:03:00.840> or

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
you know if you don't have any bangs or

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.930 
you know if you don't have any bangs or
anything<00:03:01.290> oh<00:03:01.890> wow<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.490> are<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.610> gonna<00:03:02.700> do

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
anything oh wow what are you gonna do

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.930 
anything oh wow what are you gonna do
and<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> first<00:03:04.380> generation<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and this is the first generation of the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.840 
and this is the first generation of the
new<00:03:06.090> Mayer<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.750> I'm<00:03:06.959> pretty<00:03:07.290> sure<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
new Mayer so I'm pretty sure that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.010 
new Mayer so I'm pretty sure that
eventually<00:03:08.850> they'll<00:03:09.090> find<00:03:09.120> something<00:03:09.690> where

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
eventually they'll find something where

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.860 
eventually they'll find something where
I<00:03:10.050> have<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.400> small<00:03:11.400> compact<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.270> stuff<00:03:12.540> where<00:03:12.810> it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
I have a small compact or stuff where it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.740 
I have a small compact or stuff where it
won't<00:03:12.990> show<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:14.220> beggars<00:03:15.150> can't<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.480> choosers

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
won't show but beggars can't be choosers

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.380 
won't show but beggars can't be choosers
and<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.410> really<00:03:16.680> want<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.610> here's<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.120> pause

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
and I really want it so here's the pause

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.370 
and I really want it so here's the pause
button<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.800> side<00:03:22.280> now<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.750> when

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
button is on this side now this when

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.130 
button is on this side now this when
it's<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.769> twitching<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.780> made

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
it's on twitching like this and made

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.430 
it's on twitching like this and made
this<00:03:28.290> calibrating<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.390> might<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.230> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
this calibrating so I might have to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.190 
this calibrating so I might have to
adjust<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:33.709> because<00:03:34.760> it's<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.900> little

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
adjust it because it's it can be little

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.699 
adjust it because it's it can be little

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
um if it's drooping like really slow it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.310 
um if it's drooping like really slow it
means<00:03:51.120> you're<00:03:51.420> at<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.630> highest<00:03:51.810> point<00:03:52.140> of

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
every time I look at struggling for

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.020 
every time I look at struggling for
camera<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.950> starts<00:04:14.250> wiggling<00:04:14.519> like

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
back and forth back and forth and these

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.379 
back and forth back and forth and these

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
that it's

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.479 
that it's
high<00:04:18.539> interest<00:04:19.229> or<00:04:19.530> I'm<00:04:19.680> really<00:04:19.919> excited

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
high interest or I'm really excited

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.909 
high interest or I'm really excited
about<00:04:20.729> something

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
about something

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.969 
about something
now<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.819> first<00:04:24.120> thought<00:04:24.419> is<00:04:24.449> like<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.469> tried

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
now my first thought is like I tried

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.649 
now my first thought is like I tried
looking<00:04:26.159> in<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.490> mirror<00:04:26.729> because<00:04:27.029> I<00:04:27.300> want<00:04:27.539> to

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
looking in a mirror because I want to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.529 
looking in a mirror because I want to
really<00:04:27.840> concentrate<00:04:28.169> on<00:04:29.099> each<00:04:29.430> feeling<00:04:30.029> see

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
really concentrate on each feeling see

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.170 
really concentrate on each feeling see
but<00:04:31.469> I<00:04:31.830> don't<00:04:32.279> think<00:04:32.490> that's<00:04:32.699> such<00:04:32.909> a<00:04:32.939> good

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
but I don't think that's such a good

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.739 
but I don't think that's such a good
idea

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:33.749 
idea

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.790 
idea
I<00:04:34.219> think<00:04:35.219> you<00:04:35.490> should<00:04:35.759> just<00:04:36.120> well<00:04:37.080> think<00:04:37.469> I'm

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
I think you should just well think I'm

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.489 
I think you should just well think I'm
all<00:04:37.919> excited<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.460> talk<00:04:38.550> about<00:04:38.699> this<00:04:38.969> I<00:04:39.499> think

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:40.499 
all excited to talk about this I think

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.939 
all excited to talk about this I think
that<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.370> should<00:04:41.610> just<00:04:42.080> go<00:04:43.080> along<00:04:43.349> a<00:04:43.409> day<00:04:43.740> as

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
that you should just go along a day as

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.670 
that you should just go along a day as
you<00:04:44.099> would<00:04:44.340> don't<00:04:45.330> focus<00:04:45.599> too<00:04:45.900> much<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:46.469> this

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680

I've<00:05:20.639> been<00:05:20.669> talking<00:05:20.939> about<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.539> they<00:05:22.139> just

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
I've been talking about this they just

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.829 
I've been talking about this they just
already<00:05:22.710> start<00:05:23.279> whittling<00:05:23.550> for<00:05:24.060> quite<00:05:24.810> a

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:24.839 
already start whittling for quite a

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:30.589 
already start whittling for quite a
while<00:05:25.339> so<00:05:27.409> like<00:05:28.409> I<00:05:28.560> said<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:29.039> $100<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:30.150> think

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
while so like I said it's $100 I think

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.589 
while so like I said it's $100 I think
it's<00:05:31.020> worth<00:05:31.259> it<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:32.370> only<00:05:32.550> problem<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.180> think<00:05:33.240> I

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
it's worth it the only problem I think I

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.619 
it's worth it the only problem I think I
have<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.620> does<00:05:35.099> take<00:05:35.339> four<00:05:35.939> triple-a

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
have is it does take four triple-a

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.610 
have is it does take four triple-a
batteries<00:05:37.259> if<00:05:37.939> what<00:05:38.939> I've<00:05:39.089> heard<00:05:39.479> it<00:05:40.020> does<00:05:40.259> not

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
batteries if what I've heard it does not

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.760 
batteries if what I've heard it does not
last<00:05:40.979> that<00:05:41.370> long<00:05:41.750> maybe<00:05:42.750> about<00:05:43.050> four<00:05:43.409> or<00:05:43.560> five

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
last that long maybe about four or five

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.089 
last that long maybe about four or five
hours<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:44.699> when<00:05:45.659> it<00:05:45.779> starts<00:05:46.020> blinking<00:05:46.319> that

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
hours and when it starts blinking that

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.059 
hours and when it starts blinking that
means<00:05:47.159> that<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:48.060> back<00:05:48.210> has<00:05:48.449> already<00:05:48.779> left

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
means that the back has already left

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.860 
means that the back has already left
luckily<00:05:50.069> for<00:05:50.279> me<00:05:50.339> I<00:05:50.669> have<00:05:50.879> a<00:05:50.909> ton<00:05:51.210> of<00:05:51.240> batteries

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
luckily for me I have a ton of batteries

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.619 
luckily for me I have a ton of batteries
to<00:05:52.050> dispose<00:05:52.469> of<00:05:52.580> but<00:05:53.580> some<00:05:54.060> people<00:05:54.360> aren't

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629
