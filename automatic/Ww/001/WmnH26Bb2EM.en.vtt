game from complete ground up so you
don't<00:00:12.480> need<00:00:12.660> anything<00:00:12.960> except<00:00:13.410> unity<00:00:13.769> will

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
don't need anything except unity will

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.519 
don't need anything except unity will
build<00:00:14.700> anything<00:00:15.120> everything<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> way<00:00:16.230> and

don't you don't need extensive knowledge
of<00:00:44.340> unity<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:44.700> discuss<00:00:45.270> will<00:00:45.480> give

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
of unity for discuss will give

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.360 
of unity for discuss will give
everything<00:00:46.260> from<00:00:46.440> ground<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.950> everything

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
everything from ground up and everything

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
everything from ground up and everything
will<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:47.670> easy<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.610> John<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.930> don't

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
think that you'll be also usually pretty

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
think that you'll be also usually pretty
complicated<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.829> something<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
complicated or something like that we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990 
complicated or something like that we
will<00:00:56.640> build<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.719> easy<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:59.000> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
will build it will be easy actually so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
will build it will be easy actually so
unity<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.500> been<00:01:01.680> opened<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.090> in

unity has been opened so first of all in
this<00:01:03.390> video<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.780> will<00:01:03.870> create<00:01:04.110> our

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
this video we will create our

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
this video we will create our
environment<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.240> just

environment so you do we will just
create<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.840> environment<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.340> first<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
create an environment first so first of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.270 
create an environment first so first of
all<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.510> objects<00:01:10.049> 3d<00:01:10.710> objects

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
all could you game objects 3d objects

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.789 
all could you game objects 3d objects
quad<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.020> create<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
quad so we will create a couple of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
quad so we will create a couple of
chords<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> quads<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.479> create<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
chords with the quads will create the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
chords with the quads will create the
boundaries<00:01:16.470> okay<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.369> create<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
boundaries okay will create the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
boundaries okay will create the
boundaries<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.720> create<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
boundaries and will also create the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.950 
boundaries and will also create the
bricks<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> cause<00:01:20.509> now<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> first

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
bricks with the cause now the first

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
bricks with the cause now the first
thing<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.640> will

thing that's gonna do is here we will
she<00:01:24.090> missed<00:01:24.990> glider<00:01:25.470> attached<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> quad

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
she missed glider attached to the quad

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
she missed glider attached to the quad
automatically<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.170> gotta<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.770> delete

everything I'm sorry now it's time to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.420 
everything I'm sorry now it's time to
create<00:03:51.990> our<00:03:52.080> pedal<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.800> will<00:03:52.950> move<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.400> and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
create our pedal that will move here and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.730 
create our pedal that will move here and
we'll<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.900> balance<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.230> ball

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
we'll just balance the ball

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.190 
we'll just balance the ball
so<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.520> order<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> create<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.120> barrel<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:57.840> go

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
so in order to create the barrel just go

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.120 
so in order to create the barrel just go
and<00:03:59.060> go<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.240> top<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:01.230> press<00:04:01.740> control

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130

and go to the top and just press control
D<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.490> duplicate<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.180> rename<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.820> pedal

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
D and duplicate it and rename it pedal

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.480 
D and duplicate it and rename it pedal
pedal<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.410> just<00:04:09.020> place<00:04:10.020> it<00:04:10.050> down<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.890> now

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
pedal and just place it down and now

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.330 
pedal and just place it down and now
scale<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.560> with<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> scale<00:04:13.920> through<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
scale it with the scale through the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.360 
scale it with the scale through the
scale<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.970> make<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.720> small<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:17.040> think

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
scale it and make it small now I think

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.360 
scale it and make it small now I think
this<00:04:17.640> will<00:04:17.790> be<00:04:17.910> okay<00:04:18.500> let's<00:04:19.500> make<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:19.950> like

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
this will be okay let's make it like

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.570 
this will be okay let's make it like
this<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:21.120> think<00:04:21.989> it'll<00:04:22.229> be<00:04:22.470> okay<00:04:22.850> okay<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:25.320> it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
this I think it'll be okay okay so it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:33.929 
this I think it'll be okay okay so it
peddle<00:04:25.970> now<00:04:26.409> now<00:04:31.689> now<00:04:32.689> let's<00:04:32.930> create<00:04:33.080> our<00:04:33.229> ball

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
peddle now now now let's create our ball

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:37.350 
peddle now now now let's create our ball
so<00:04:34.939> in<00:04:35.060> order<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.330> create<00:04:35.629> that<00:04:35.800> game<00:04:36.800> object

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
so in order to create that game object

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.010 
so in order to create that game object
through<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.389> object

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
through the object

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.920 
through the object
sphere<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.699> this<00:04:40.939> is<00:04:41.090> bull<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.539> will<00:04:41.689> be<00:04:41.810> our

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
sphere so this is bull this will be our

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.290 
sphere so this is bull this will be our
ball<00:04:42.289> now<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:43.039> has<00:04:43.219> already<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.879> sphere

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
ball now it has already a sphere

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.119 
ball now it has already a sphere
Collider<00:04:44.659> attached<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.259> it<00:04:45.439> we<00:04:45.620> don't<00:04:45.889> want

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
Collider attached to it we don't want

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.980 
Collider attached to it we don't want
this<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:46.669> just<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.090> go<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.419> move<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.780> sphere

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
this so just to go and move the sphere

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.240 
this so just to go and move the sphere
Collider<00:04:48.469> and<00:04:48.949> from<00:04:49.729> here<00:04:49.939> add<00:04:50.300> component

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
Collider and from here add component

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.749 
Collider and from here add component
physics<00:04:52.250> 2d<00:04:52.780> sucker<00:04:53.780> climate<00:04:54.259> Tony<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.770> we

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
physics 2d sucker climate Tony and we

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.180 
physics 2d sucker climate Tony and we
also<00:04:56.060> want<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.659> attach<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.259> box<00:04:57.620> Collider<00:04:57.860> to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
also want to attach a box Collider to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.850 
also want to attach a box Collider to
this<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.550> mean<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.300> rigidbody<00:04:59.690> do<00:05:00.020> things<00:05:00.259> so<00:05:00.530> add

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
this I mean a rigidbody do things so add

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.770 
this I mean a rigidbody do things so add
component<00:05:01.569> physics<00:05:02.569> 2d<00:05:02.719> the<00:05:03.500> rigidbody<00:05:03.830> 2d

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
component physics 2d the rigidbody 2d

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.309 
component physics 2d the rigidbody 2d
okay<00:05:05.780> now<00:05:06.469> we<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:07.060> almost<00:05:08.080> set<00:05:09.080> up<00:05:09.199> our

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
okay now we have almost set up our

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:09.999 
okay now we have almost set up our
environment

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
environment

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.050 
environment
okay<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:11.750> let's<00:05:12.050> click<00:05:12.949> and<00:05:13.280> let's<00:05:13.729> see<00:05:13.879> what

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
okay so let's click and let's see what

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.260 
okay so let's click and let's see what
happens

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
happens

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.149 
happens
the<00:05:17.270> ball<00:05:17.479> should<00:05:17.690> fall<00:05:18.020> why<00:05:18.889> is<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.099> taking

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
the ball should fall why is it taking

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.339 
the ball should fall why is it taking
some<00:05:19.400> something<00:05:19.550> yes<00:05:19.849> so<00:05:20.569> the<00:05:20.719> ball<00:05:20.900> will<00:05:21.080> fall

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
some something yes so the ball will fall

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.170 
some something yes so the ball will fall
and<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.770> will<00:05:21.800> attach<00:05:22.129> here<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.879> will<00:05:22.969> just

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
and it will attach here it will just

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.820 
and it will attach here it will just
stop<00:05:23.479> here<00:05:23.509> because<00:05:23.810> we<00:05:24.169> have<00:05:24.289> a<00:05:24.319> test<00:05:24.620> a

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
stop here because we have a test a

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.429 
stop here because we have a test a
really<00:05:25.099> buddy<00:05:25.279> component<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:25.909> it<00:05:26.029> I<00:05:26.840> mean<00:05:27.379> a

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
really buddy component to it I mean a

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.589 
really buddy component to it I mean a
Collider<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:28.009> it<00:05:28.129> so<00:05:28.879> in<00:05:29.000> this<00:05:29.090> video<00:05:29.210> we<00:05:29.419> just

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
Collider to it so in this video we just

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.969 
Collider to it so in this video we just
set<00:05:29.840> up<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.080> environment<00:05:30.560> from<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.800> next

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
set up the environment from the next

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.529 
set up the environment from the next
video<00:05:31.190> we'll<00:05:31.310> start<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.759> actual<00:05:31.940> scripting

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
video we'll start the actual scripting

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.059 
video we'll start the actual scripting
so<00:05:32.719> let's<00:05:33.020> go<00:05:33.169> ahead<00:05:33.229> and<00:05:33.319> check<00:05:33.740> out<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.979> next

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
so let's go ahead and check out the next

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.649 
so let's go ahead and check out the next
video<00:05:34.279> I<00:05:34.580> hope<00:05:34.699> you'll<00:05:34.909> enjoy<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.150> thank<00:05:35.599> you

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
video I hope you'll enjoy it thank you

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.139 
video I hope you'll enjoy it thank you
