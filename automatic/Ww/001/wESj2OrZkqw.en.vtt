because I can just remember how I felt
going<00:01:02.239> back<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.630> school<00:01:02.870> because<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.290> was<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
going back to school because it was a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.260 
going back to school because it was a
time<00:01:03.710> when<00:01:03.830> I<00:01:03.890> was<00:01:04.010> gaining<00:01:04.220> weight<00:01:04.520> and<00:01:04.820> it

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
time when I was gaining weight and it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.150 
time when I was gaining weight and it
was<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.420> time<00:01:05.630> when<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:05.990> wasn't<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.710> control<00:01:06.860> of

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
was a time when I wasn't in control of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.780 
was a time when I wasn't in control of
my<00:01:07.280> life

my life

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.359 
my life
and<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:07.970> think<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.630> if<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.590> had<00:01:09.860> seen<00:01:10.130> this

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
and I think that if I had seen this

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.240 
and I think that if I had seen this
video<00:01:10.729> by<00:01:11.630> someone<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.380> me<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:12.830> don't<00:01:12.890> mean<00:01:13.220> to

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
blow my own trumpet here but if I have

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.620 
blow my own trumpet here but if I have
seen<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> video<00:01:15.920> like<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.729> from<00:01:17.270> someone<00:01:17.570> like

me<00:01:18.080> who<00:01:18.260> had<00:01:18.380> lost<00:01:18.530> loads<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.920> weight<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:20.090> it

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
me who had lost loads of weight then it

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.730 
me who had lost loads of weight then it
would<00:01:20.509> have<00:01:20.630> changed<00:01:20.660> my<00:01:21.050> life<00:01:21.080> because<00:01:21.590> I
