00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.870 

the<00:00:02.480> next<00:00:03.040> piece<00:00:04.040> that<00:00:04.070> I<00:00:04.279> want<00:00:04.490> to<00:00:04.580> talk<00:00:04.700> about

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:04.880 
the next piece that I want to talk about

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.840 
the next piece that I want to talk about
is<00:00:05.680> something<00:00:06.680> that<00:00:07.010> we<00:00:07.100> all<00:00:07.250> come<00:00:07.430> back<00:00:07.490> to

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
is something that we all come back to

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.170 
is something that we all come back to
which<00:00:08.059> is<00:00:08.210> measurement<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.550> the<00:00:10.550> point<00:00:10.820> here

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
which is measurement and the point here

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.270 
which is measurement and the point here
is<00:00:11.450> we've<00:00:11.840> all<00:00:12.019> talked<00:00:12.320> about<00:00:12.470> getting<00:00:12.890> beyond

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
is we've all talked about getting beyond

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.400 
is we've all talked about getting beyond
the<00:00:13.460> click<00:00:13.700> getting<00:00:14.389> beyond<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:14.840> impression

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
the click getting beyond the impression

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.410 
the click getting beyond the impression
but<00:00:16.219> I<00:00:16.279> think<00:00:16.609> that<00:00:16.760> if<00:00:16.880> we're<00:00:17.029> going<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:17.240> have

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
but I think that if we're going to have

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.020 
but I think that if we're going to have
a<00:00:17.449> much<00:00:17.810> more<00:00:17.840> user<00:00:18.410> centric<00:00:18.860> approach<00:00:19.190> to<00:00:19.910> our

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
a much more user centric approach to our

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.060 
a much more user centric approach to our
advertising<00:00:20.510> efforts<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.470> metrics<00:00:21.860> need<00:00:22.010> to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
advertising efforts the metrics need to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.760 
advertising efforts the metrics need to
change<00:00:22.460> in<00:00:22.730> a<00:00:22.820> profound<00:00:23.119> way<00:00:23.449> as<00:00:23.630> well<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.199> I'm

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
change in a profound way as well and I'm

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.060 
change in a profound way as well and I'm
going<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:24.920> give<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:25.160> two<00:00:25.310> examples<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.910> these

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
going to give you two examples of these

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.140 
going to give you two examples of these
you<00:00:28.070> know<00:00:28.160> we've<00:00:28.310> talked<00:00:28.490> a<00:00:28.609> lot<00:00:28.640> about<00:00:28.789> how

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
you know we've talked a lot about how

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.139 
you know we've talked a lot about how
users<00:00:29.660> engage<00:00:30.020> emotionally<00:00:30.890> with<00:00:31.039> ads<00:00:31.279> well

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
users engage emotionally with ads well

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.639 
users engage emotionally with ads well
we<00:00:32.269> need<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.480> actually<00:00:32.629> find<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.109> way<00:00:33.199> of<00:00:33.350> really

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
we need to actually find a way of really

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.130 
we need to actually find a way of really
measuring<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.570> at<00:00:35.720> Google<00:00:35.840> we're

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
measuring this and and at Google we're

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.290 
measuring this and and at Google we're
focused<00:00:36.470> on<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:36.739> very<00:00:37.070> aggressively<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.940> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
focused on this very aggressively and I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.790 
focused on this very aggressively and I
know<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.720> lot<00:00:38.899> of<00:00:38.930> other<00:00:39.170> companies<00:00:39.380> are

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
know that a lot of other companies are

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.490 
know that a lot of other companies are
as<00:00:40.340> well<00:00:40.700> just<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.690> give<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:41.899> an<00:00:41.960> example<00:00:42.230> of<00:00:42.440> a

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
as well just to give you an example of a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.370 
as well just to give you an example of a
project<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:43.010> we<00:00:43.100> just<00:00:43.370> ran<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:44.809> used<00:00:45.079> some

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
project that we just ran we used some

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.130 
project that we just ran we used some
special<00:00:46.190> biometric<00:00:46.700> technology<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.989> measure

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
special biometric technology to measure

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.160 
special biometric technology to measure
things<00:00:48.469> like<00:00:48.559> hover<00:00:48.890> rates<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:50.840> know<00:00:50.870> eye

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
things like hover rates you know eye

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.590 
things like hover rates you know eye
tracking<00:00:51.770> etc<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.700> measure<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.090> emotional

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
tracking etc to measure the emotional

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.930 
tracking etc to measure the emotional
emotional<00:00:53.899> engagement<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.770> user<00:00:54.980> as<00:00:55.309> an<00:00:55.789> ad

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
emotional engagement of a user as an ad

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.069 
emotional engagement of a user as an ad
played<00:00:56.239> out<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.539> this<00:00:56.600> happened<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.960> be<00:00:57.020> a

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
played out and this happened to be a

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.569 
played out and this happened to be a
video<00:00:57.379> ad<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.770> was<00:00:57.890> running<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.340> banner

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
video ad that was running in a banner

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.250 
video ad that was running in a banner
and<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.239> were<00:00:59.360> able<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.600> determine<00:00:59.930> precisely

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
and we were able to determine precisely

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.439 
and we were able to determine precisely
where<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.309> ad<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.030> emotional

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
where in that ad the emotional

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.479 
where in that ad the emotional
connection<00:01:02.840> was<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.110> strongest<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.829> as<00:01:04.460> a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
connection was the strongest and as a

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.099 
connection was the strongest and as a
result<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.359> insights<00:01:05.719> that<00:01:06.020> were

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:06.109 
result of that the insights that were

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:07.989 
result of that the insights that were
given<00:01:06.409> back<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.709> the<00:01:06.829> advertisers<00:01:07.459> were<00:01:07.639> truly

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
given back to the advertisers were truly

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:10.480 
given back to the advertisers were truly
profound<00:01:08.679> now<00:01:09.679> of<00:01:09.829> course<00:01:10.039> this<00:01:10.279> was<00:01:10.459> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
profound now of course this was a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.099 
profound now of course this was a
one-off<00:01:10.789> and<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.630> not<00:01:11.779> something<00:01:11.990> that's

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
one-off and it's not something that's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.230 
one-off and it's not something that's
common<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.709> any<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:13.189> our<00:01:13.490> campaigns<00:01:13.999> that<00:01:14.119> we

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
common in any of our campaigns that we

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.149 
common in any of our campaigns that we
run<00:01:14.420> today<00:01:14.749> but<00:01:15.380> imagine<00:01:15.799> if<00:01:15.889> we<00:01:16.069> could

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
run today but imagine if we could

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.129 
run today but imagine if we could
actually<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.639> this<00:01:16.789> at<00:01:16.969> scale<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.569> deliver

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
actually do this at scale and deliver

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.559 
actually do this at scale and deliver
this<00:01:18.349> as<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.649> means<00:01:19.069> to<00:01:19.520> measure<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.329> efficacy

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
this as a means to measure the efficacy

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.410 
this as a means to measure the efficacy
of<00:01:21.049> all<00:01:21.319> of<00:01:21.469> our<00:01:21.619> campaigns<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.490> imagine<00:01:23.329> if

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
of all of our campaigns and imagine if

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.399 
of all of our campaigns and imagine if
we<00:01:23.509> could<00:01:23.630> tie<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.109> things<00:01:24.319> like

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
we could tie it to things like

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.969 
we could tie it to things like
likelihood<00:01:25.039> to<00:01:25.159> purchase<00:01:25.599> you<00:01:26.599> know<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:26.979> we

likelihood to purchase you know we we

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.739 
likelihood to purchase you know we we
recently<00:01:28.189> did<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.549> study<00:01:28.670> where<00:01:29.029> we<00:01:29.179> found<00:01:29.479> that

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
recently did a study where we found that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.989 
recently did a study where we found that
a<00:01:30.139> well-executed<00:01:30.740> display<00:01:31.369> campaign<00:01:31.819> can

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
a well-executed display campaign can

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.029 
a well-executed display campaign can
increase<00:01:32.419> the<00:01:32.899> likelihood<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.469> purchase<00:01:33.799> by

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
increase the likelihood to purchase by

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.959 
increase the likelihood to purchase by
24%<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.139> rich<00:01:36.289> media<00:01:36.969> interactive

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.230 
24% and a rich media interactive
campaign<00:01:38.569> can<00:01:38.810> increase<00:01:39.109> it<00:01:39.259> by<00:01:39.349> 34%<00:01:40.240> imagine

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
campaign can increase it by 34% imagine

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.059 
campaign can increase it by 34% imagine
if<00:01:41.329> that<00:01:41.359> wasn't<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.200> one-off<00:01:42.409> case<00:01:42.799> study

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
if that wasn't just a one-off case study

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.769 
if that wasn't just a one-off case study
but<00:01:43.579> if<00:01:43.669> we<00:01:43.759> could<00:01:43.880> actually<00:01:44.029> measure<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.450> on

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779 
but if we could actually measure that on

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:47.319 
but if we could actually measure that on

that as a one-off case study but that
was<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.319> standard<00:02:24.650> metric<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:25.340> could

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
was just a standard metric that we could

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.339 
was just a standard metric that we could
all<00:02:25.640> deliver<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.180> our<00:02:26.300> advertisers<00:02:26.599> on<00:02:27.290> a

prediction that I'm talking about here

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.460 
prediction that I'm talking about here
is<00:02:31.550> saying<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.239> well<00:02:32.690> over<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.019> third<00:02:33.290> of

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
is saying that for well over a third of

is saying that for well over a third of
those<00:02:33.590> campaigns<00:02:34.130> that's<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.819> fact<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.209> to

those campaigns that's in fact going to

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.570 
those campaigns that's in fact going to
be<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.540> case<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.319> primary<00:02:36.739> metric<00:02:37.130> won't<00:02:37.400> be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
be the case the primary metric won't be

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.220 
be the case the primary metric won't be
an<00:02:37.670> impression<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.300> click<00:02:38.599> or<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.780> conversion

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
it will be something on the order of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.390 
it will be something on the order of
measuring<00:02:42.260> emotional<00:02:42.739> engagement<00:02:43.190> with<00:02:43.280> the

the Internet I think the momentum behind
that<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.620> tremendous<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.340> think<00:04:52.610> we<00:04:52.820> need<00:04:52.970> to

that is tremendous I think we need to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.440 
that is tremendous I think we need to
keep<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.450> up<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:53.990> if<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.310> know

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
keep that up and if we do that you know

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.330 
keep that up and if we do that you know
25<00:04:56.450> billion<00:04:56.690> ads<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.140> day<00:04:57.170> are<00:04:57.710> going<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.160> have

25 billion ads a day are going to have
this<00:04:58.550> type<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.790> information<00:04:59.450> associated<00:04:59.750> with

this type of information associated with

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.050 
this type of information associated with
them<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.590> think<00:05:00.950> that's<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.400> that's<00:05:01.670> a<00:05:01.850> goal<00:05:02.030> that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
them I think that's a that's a goal that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.450 
them I think that's a that's a goal that
we<00:05:02.330> can<00:05:02.510> all<00:05:02.720> feel<00:05:03.080> proud<00:05:03.380> aspiring<00:05:03.920> towards

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
we can all feel proud aspiring towards

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.490 
we can all feel proud aspiring towards
and<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.240> technology<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.870> coming<00:05:06.170> into<00:05:06.290> place

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
and the technology is coming into place

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.600 
and the technology is coming into place
to<00:05:06.680> be<00:05:06.770> able<00:05:06.890> to<00:05:07.040> do<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:09.040> now<00:05:10.040> if<00:05:10.130> we<00:05:10.250> do<00:05:10.400> all

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
to be able to do that now if we do all

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.610 
to be able to do that now if we do all
of<00:05:10.760> these<00:05:10.880> five<00:05:11.120> predictions<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.320> talked

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
of these five predictions that I talked

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.130 
of these five predictions that I talked
about<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:13.730> comes<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.150> my<00:05:14.270> favorite<00:05:14.660> prediction

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
about it comes to my favorite prediction

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.380 
about it comes to my favorite prediction
which<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:16.130> that<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.280> think<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.670> nearly<00:05:17.030> half

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
which is that I think that nearly half

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.190 
which is that I think that nearly half
of<00:05:17.660> all<00:05:18.640> users<00:05:19.640> if<00:05:20.090> they<00:05:20.390> were<00:05:20.600> ever<00:05:20.810> polled

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
of all users if they were ever polled

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.410 
of all users if they were ever polled
would<00:05:21.800> say<00:05:22.010> that<00:05:22.220> display<00:05:22.520> advertising<00:05:23.000> is

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
would say that display advertising is

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.210 
would say that display advertising is
their<00:05:23.930> favorite<00:05:24.350> ad<00:05:24.470> format<00:05:25.660> as<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:27.860> heard<00:05:28.070> me

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
their favorite ad format as you heard me

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.740 
their favorite ad format as you heard me
allude<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.610> little<00:05:28.880> bit<00:05:28.970> earlier<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:29.330> said

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
allude to a little bit earlier I said

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.240 
allude to a little bit earlier I said
today<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.170> number<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.470> something<00:05:30.650> like<00:05:30.860> 18

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
today that number is something like 18

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.220 
today that number is something like 18

ads<00:05:33.410> are<00:05:33.590> useful<00:05:33.950> or<00:05:34.040> very<00:05:34.130> useful<00:05:34.580> but<00:05:35.300> as<00:05:35.450> I

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
ads are useful or very useful but as I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.180 
ads are useful or very useful but as I
said<00:05:35.840> if<00:05:36.020> we<00:05:36.140> did<00:05:36.350> all<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.530> those<00:05:36.740> things<00:05:36.800> that

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
said if we did all of those things that

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.770 
said if we did all of those things that
were<00:05:37.400> embedded<00:05:37.640> in<00:05:37.880> my<00:05:38.030> prediction<00:05:38.330> that

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
were embedded in my prediction that

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.690 
were embedded in my prediction that
number<00:05:39.470> would<00:05:39.620> increase<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:40.160> something<00:05:40.520> like

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
number would increase to something like

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.570 
number would increase to something like
two<00:05:40.940> thirds<00:05:41.150> sixty-six<00:05:42.050> percent<00:05:42.200> so<00:05:43.130> it's<00:05:43.400> not

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
two thirds sixty-six percent so it's not

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.460 
two thirds sixty-six percent so it's not
that<00:05:43.760> big<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.090> stretch<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.390> say<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:45.080> you

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
that big of a stretch to say that you

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.080 
that big of a stretch to say that you
know<00:05:45.590> about<00:05:45.770> half<00:05:46.040> of<00:05:46.130> those<00:05:46.280> users<00:05:46.610> would<00:05:46.910> say

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
know about half of those users would say

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.850 
know about half of those users would say
that<00:05:47.270> display<00:05:47.630> is<00:05:47.870> their<00:05:48.020> favorite<00:05:48.440> format

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
that display is their favorite format

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.790 
that display is their favorite format
and<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:50.510> think<00:05:50.720> that's<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:51.020> that's<00:05:51.170> all<00:05:51.560> in<00:05:51.740> the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and I think that's a that's all in the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.310 
and I think that's a that's all in the
industry<00:05:52.100> that<00:05:52.220> we'd<00:05:52.370> be<00:05:52.460> extremely<00:05:53.060> proud<00:05:53.320> to

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
industry that we'd be extremely proud to

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.730 
industry that we'd be extremely proud to
be<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.770> part<00:05:55.070> of

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
be a part of

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.460 
be a part of
so<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:58.310> to<00:05:58.400> recap<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:59.390> predictions<00:05:59.870> that<00:06:00.170> I

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
so just to recap the predictions that I

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.200 
so just to recap the predictions that I
that<00:06:00.920> I've<00:06:01.040> talked<00:06:01.280> about<00:06:01.400> our<00:06:01.760> online
