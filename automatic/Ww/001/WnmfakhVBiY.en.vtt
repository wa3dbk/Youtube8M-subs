00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.820
 My name is Gerd Gerdes I am am 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.820
 hauser company somehow holland 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.500
 employed since 1990 and product manager 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.570
 for the self-propelled forage harvesters and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.300
 for forage technology like holland 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.160
 shines through 50 years of shredder tree and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 especially the chipper today in 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.240
 Germany where we are in biogas country 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.220
 is becoming more and more important to us 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.960
 So have a total of five machines in the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.090
 program we build in the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.580
 different configurations and on 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.690
 this one is here a machine 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.400
 specified for both 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.949
 agricultural use as well 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.860
 for the contractor and in particular 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.080
 also for a biogas plant biogas plants 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.670
 For example, you want something different than yours 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.190
 land for extremely short cut 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.260
 have material that means that then in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.089
 the moment also the witch length up to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.960
 go down four millimeters or more 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.500
 even under it 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.449
 and that is of course possible through a 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.920
 Knife drum of a special drum the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.909
 we can see here in front 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.100
 with 20 times two knives 20 left and 20 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.200
 Knife to the right means total 40 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.030
 knife and then in connection with the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.909
 high speed of the drum, I come up 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.380
 insane cut frequencies of 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.719
 28,000 cuts per minute, which of course 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.070
 so important is the even 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.930
 chopped up and is short 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.090
 cut material accordingly 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.710
 Of course, a farmer would like to have one too 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 still have a bit of structure here 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.539
 for example, if he silage silage now 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.609
 or maissilage harvests for the biogas 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.979
 but I can operate accordingly 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.079
 configure the machine with something 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.969
 less knife with different speed too 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.320
 on the drums, of course, too 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.640
 for this application the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.100
 to get the right machine 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.469
 besides, it is important of course that 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.630
 every grain is struck so every 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.819
 corn grain is struck and there 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.859
 it's mostly processor that we roll 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.920
 have used to really 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.749
 the grain is skewered so that too 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.350
 animal goddoms according to market it 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.600
 can 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.590
 these are of course special things which 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.350
 we have the machine in here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.179
 In addition, the user wants to know today 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.860
 how much he finally right on the field 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.140
 That's why we have the machine 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.780
 built in a yield measurement that measures 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.780
 So the tonnage speaks the chopped 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.250
 good in parallel with the moisture and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 Of course I can draw conclusions 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.379
 also close to the earnings or then 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.810
 in the moment when the biogas plant that 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.819
 Material from a farmer can be used immediately 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.830
 be billed because I have direct 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.569
 the billing on the screen of 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.730
 a shredder and I can even do that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.560
 to further retrace in which the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.299
 an antenna machine gets that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.489
 Also immediately knows how high is the yield 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.500
 on every square meter that is today 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.180
 the rules of the game where the world goes and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.120
 Of course these are things that are also today 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.120
 here the witch meets ps classes around that 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 one round off from 400 to 850 ps in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.290
 all segments where we are at home 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.940
 the bandwidth too, that's for sure 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.430
 another exciting topic what the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.010
 As far as the headset is concerned , that is possible 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.530
 for the corn use of a 6 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.569
 row header to reach a 12 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.980
 parallel during the like 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.959
 machines equipped for the grass 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.819
 Learned with a pick up then the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.920
 to be able to absorb grass or fall 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.780
 for example, for the whole plant 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.739
 I can also use silage for a cereal 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.609
 Cutting work from a combine harvester 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.250
 adapt 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.889
 or something completely new in the winter month 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.639
 for harvesting energy wood 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.799
 fast growing wood poplars or 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.420
 Grazing wood header in front of the machine 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.160
 adapted for the customer for the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.019
 farmer of course, a machine he 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.000
 can use almost twelve months a year 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.530
 of course, I have high contribution margins 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.060
 and draw a calculator and machine 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.560
 Correspondingly better when I am in 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.579
 purchase accordingly 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.579
 OK thank you 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.189
 Thank you
