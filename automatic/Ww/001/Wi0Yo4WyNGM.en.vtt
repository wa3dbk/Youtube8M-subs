00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
around here make it like an H an old

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460 
around here make it like an H an old
castle<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.909> that'd<00:03:43.180> be<00:03:43.329> really<00:03:43.629> cool<00:03:43.930> so

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
castle have that'd be really cool so

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.469 
castle have that'd be really cool so
let's<00:03:44.500> go<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.069> left<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:45.970> he<00:03:46.150> has<00:03:46.299> the

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
let's go to the left which he has the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.300 
let's go to the left which he has the
NPC<00:03:47.109> house<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.680> pretty<00:03:48.519> much<00:03:48.759> every<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
NPC house and pretty much every of the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.770 
NPC house and pretty much every of the
workstations<00:03:52.000> there's<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.239> couple<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.479> mission

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
workstations there's a couple of mission

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.449 
workstations there's a couple of mission
there<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.169> there's<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.709> lot<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:54.009> them<00:03:54.129> any<00:03:54.280> is<00:03:54.430> a

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
there but there's a lot of them any is a

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.849 
there but there's a lot of them any is a
lot<00:03:54.909> of<00:03:55.030> them<00:03:55.150> around<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.569> map<00:03:55.750> as<00:03:55.900> well<00:03:56.229> so

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
lot of them around the map as well so

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.369 
lot of them around the map as well so
this<00:03:56.979> is<00:03:57.040> version<00:03:57.519> 2<00:03:57.909> and<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.419> think<00:03:59.019> this<00:03:59.169> was

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
this is version 2 and I think this was

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.780 
this is version 2 and I think this was
from<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.709> Xbox<00:04:01.259> 360<00:04:02.259> maybe<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:03.310> he's<00:04:03.430> got<00:04:03.639> all

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
from the Xbox 360 maybe but he's got all

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.740 
from the Xbox 360 maybe but he's got all
of<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.799> NPC's<00:04:05.799> there<00:04:06.189> and<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> left<00:04:07.449> he

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
of the NPC's there and to the left he

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.360 
of the NPC's there and to the left he
has<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> little<00:04:08.259> farm<00:04:08.650> which<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.949> can<00:04:09.099> turn<00:04:09.310> on

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
has a little farm which you can turn on

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.780 
has a little farm which you can turn on
and<00:04:09.729> grab<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.810> load<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.229> things<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.340> that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
and grab a load of things so that

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.869

they're the actual NPCs to do things to
turn<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.209> off<00:04:16.359> though<00:04:16.599> because<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.989> don't

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
turn that off though because I don't

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.409 
turn that off though because I don't
need<00:04:17.259> any<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.489> one<00:04:18.759> thing<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
cool things like these traps which

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.379 
cool things like these traps which
really<00:04:31.840> do<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.770> big<00:04:33.159> effect<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:34.300> as

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
really do have a big effect because as

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.459 
really do have a big effect because as
soon<00:04:34.570> as<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.779> turn<00:04:34.960> them<00:04:35.139> on

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
soon as you turn them on

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.040 
soon as you turn them on
obviously<00:04:36.250> ill<00:04:36.430> take<00:04:36.909> out<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> enemies<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.659> I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
obviously ill take out the enemies and I

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.690 
obviously ill take out the enemies and I
know<00:04:38.110> they're<00:04:38.380> not<00:04:38.409> spaced<00:04:38.860> apart<00:04:39.219> so<00:04:39.550> that

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
know they're not spaced apart so that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.610 
know they're not spaced apart so that
won't<00:04:39.820> do<00:04:40.029> the<00:04:40.180> maximum<00:04:40.599> damage<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.529> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
won't do the maximum damage but the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.550 
won't do the maximum damage but the
spiky<00:04:42.070> balls<00:04:42.310> would<00:04:42.610> deal<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:43.000> lot<00:04:43.479> of<00:04:43.690> dps<00:04:44.349> to

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
spiky balls would deal a lot of dps to

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.240 
spiky balls would deal a lot of dps to
them<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.889> there<00:04:45.849> is<00:04:45.880> loads<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.389> mana<00:04:46.900> em<00:04:47.250> they

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
them and there is loads of mana em they

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.659 
them and there is loads of mana em they
mana<00:04:48.699> crystal<00:04:49.599> no<00:04:49.870> was<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.529> the<00:04:50.710> mana<00:04:51.340> Creek

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
mana crystal no was it the mana Creek

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.089 
mana crystal no was it the mana Creek
mana<00:04:52.180> crystal<00:04:52.630> thing<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:53.080> don't<00:04:53.139> know<00:04:53.380> magic<00:04:53.770> I

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
mana crystal thing I don't know magic I

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.010 
mana crystal thing I don't know magic I
think<00:04:54.340> it's<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.520> magic<00:04:54.789> ball<00:04:55.029> isn't<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.539> the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
think it's the magic ball isn't it the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.839 
think it's the magic ball isn't it the
magic<00:04:56.199> magic<00:04:56.680> crystal<00:04:57.130> or<00:04:57.219> so<00:04:57.430> something<00:04:57.820> like

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
magic magic crystal or so something like

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.060 
magic magic crystal or so something like
that<00:04:57.969> come<00:04:58.630> over<00:04:58.779> to<00:04:58.930> pick<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.110> up<00:04:59.289> but<00:04:59.560> yet

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
that come over to pick it up but yet

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.860 
that come over to pick it up but yet
that<00:05:00.400> revives<00:05:00.789> your<00:05:01.000> mana<00:05:01.240> for<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.539> certain

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
that revives your mana for a certain

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.060 
that revives your mana for a certain
amount<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.110> time<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.380> just<00:05:02.529> increases<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
amount of time it just increases the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.430 
amount of time it just increases the
mana<00:05:03.490> rate<00:05:03.729> and<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.630> just<00:05:04.870> loads<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.320> different

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
mana rate and it just loads of different
