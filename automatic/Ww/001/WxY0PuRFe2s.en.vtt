00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
which would be interesting so what I've

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
which would be interesting so what I've
done<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> I've<00:01:01.109> turned<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:02.039> mechanism

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
done here is I've turned this mechanism

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030 
done here is I've turned this mechanism
oops<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.480> mechanism<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.320> normally

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
oops this mechanism right here normally

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160 
oops this mechanism right here normally
the<00:01:05.159> chain<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> other<00:01:06.000> side<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the chain is on the other side so that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
the chain is on the other side so that
it<00:01:07.260> beats<00:01:07.439> forward<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:08.580> turned<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it beats forward and I've turned that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
it beats forward and I've turned that
I've<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.600> turned<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> chain<00:01:10.350> around<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I've just turned that chain around so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
I've just turned that chain around so
that<00:01:10.979> it'll<00:01:11.220> push<00:01:12.090> kick<00:01:12.420> backwards<00:01:12.689> instead

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that it'll push kick backwards instead

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.249 
that it'll push kick backwards instead
of<00:01:13.260> forwards<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:13.920> kick<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.330> okay<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.390> I'm

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of forwards on my kick it okay so I'm

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.340 
of forwards on my kick it okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.390> hey<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.570> guitars<00:01:18.930> actually
