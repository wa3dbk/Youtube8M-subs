00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 There will be an instruction from the Prime Minister of Japan Nobuhiko Noda. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Following last year's aviation censorship ceremony, today's observational ceremony, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 As a reviewer, I had the opportunity to directly teach many members, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 As Prime Minister, Chief Commander, I am delighted to be a great pleasure. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Ships centered on the main ship "Kurama", a majestic figure of an aircraft. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 A well-trained, unspoiled fleet movement. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 And the disciplined and serious eyes of your morally motivated members. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Today, I witness these 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I am once again impressed by the pride of having the SDF in this country. 10 00: 01: 10,000-&gt; 00:00: 15,000 This show shows the results of your daily training, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 The sense of mission and preparedness that you have in your heart 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Have as many people as you know 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 I can not stop believing that it will be an important opportunity. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Ocean nation, the sea that is the foundation of Japan. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 The sea, which is Japan's largest frontier. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Your job responsibilities to protect our seas are 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is nothing less than protecting the foundation of the Japanese existence. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Since the launch of the Maritime Guard, the predecessor of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, this year, 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 We have reached a milestone of 60 years. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 The security environment surrounding Japan is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 What is more severe than ever 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I do not have to say to you again. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Launch a missile called "Artificial Satellite" 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 There are neighboring countries that carry out nuclear development. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 There are also various events surrounding the territory and sovereignty. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 On the other hand, the scene of activity of the Self Defense Force is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Not only around Japan but also all over the world 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 It has spread. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Maintain our peace and independence, 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Since the creation of the Self-Defense Force to protect the safety of the people 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 The core of our mission is unchanged, but in a new era, 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 The mission is gradually changing and becoming more important. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 In such a kind, 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Today I would like to ask you three things. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 First of all, I would like to ask you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Polish your unit's power. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 In a new era, you will be given various new tasks, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 I think you will encounter more difficult situations more often. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Please cultivate the power to do it well from normal. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Build "Dynamic Defense Force" according to "Defense Rules", 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Please polish it. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 What do you need when you are in trouble? 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Please thoroughly examine and train in each department. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 You are not simply a deterrent by simply existing. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 It is only through the daily effort of each of you who has been trained and refined. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 The defense has a concrete backing. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 The second thing I want you to ask is your courage to act boldly. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 A phase that has never been experienced before, under unprecedented circumstances, 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 You may be faced with a scene where you feel pressure. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 But you are the last source of security for the nation. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Defense does not have the word "unexpected". 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Believing in the power you normally nurture when you face difficulties, 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 After considering what to do for the country for calm deposition, 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 I want you to stand boldly in the situation. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 The power to open up the situation at any time is 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Do not forget that the end depends on your courage. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And the third thing I want to ask you is 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 It is about spreading the bond of trust. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 In disaster dispatch by the previous Great East Japan Earthquake, 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 All for the victims 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 The heartfeltness of 100,000 members in disaster response, 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I was deeply moved by the people. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 In the afflicted area, oneself only takes a few weeks, 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 The hearts of the members who continued to provide the victims with cooked rice and pork soup are 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 I must have deepened my bond with the victims. 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Also, the success of the Tomodachi operation, which the US Army and the SDF jointly dealt with, 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 We firmly connected the bonds of Japan and the United States in the Japan-US alliance. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 We will deepen Japan-US dynamic defense cooperation in the future 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 It will be a great source. 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 In addition, your colleagues are 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Away from Somalia in the Gulf of Aden 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 What is in charge of securing the safety of maritime traffic is 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Strengthen ties with people involved in Japan's shipping, 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Deepen ties with countries around the world and trust in Japan as a whole 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 It is enhancing me. 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And, in carrying out a strictly dangerous task, 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Feelings of gratitude for the bond with the family who always supports you 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 I want you to always hold it. I hope so. 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Finally, I will ask you again the "five provinces" that convey the naval tradition. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I will never take it. 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Only shameful words and acts. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 I have no choice for energy. 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 It's all about the effort. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 There is nothing wrong with it. 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 If you are in the heart of this "five provinces" question, 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 The noble mission to protect the country 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 I believe it will play. 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Always close to the people, 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 I believe that I will continue to be a gentle brave. 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Now is the high expectation of the people 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 In order to be a Self-Defense Force who responds to thick trust 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 I sincerely hope that you will work harder. 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 I will give my instruction. 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 October 14, 2012 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Prime Minister Nobuhiro Noda
