00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello with you sergey patin and in 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.580
 I would like to tell this video lesson 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.090
 you about how you can enable the show 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.250
 hidden files and folders on the operating 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.190
 os x system 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.650
 that is, for those who have computers from 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.109
 Apple's company can be useful to you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.510
 then when you need to install 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.260
 let's say some photoshop script 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.570
 photoshop action and other uses may 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 sometimes used literally today 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
 our support service has just arrived 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.520
 such a letter where a person writes that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.309
 he can't install photoshop 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 certain action because it does not know 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.649
 where to show hidden files in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 os x operating system 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 and this script is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.370
 is installed in a hidden folder which 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.940
 man simply cannot see 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.070
 and if on the windows operating system 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.750
 everyone already knows how to do it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 we open any folder organize 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 Folder and search options are very kind 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.970
 bottom we turn on the tick show 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.580
 hidden files and folders and drives and except 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.340
 addition it can be done through the panel 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.530
 control start control panel and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.070
 here in the control panel folder 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.750
 folder options we can enable exactly 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.320
 also showing hidden folder files and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 drives 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 it is the operating system folder properties 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 as such there is no why it is done here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 all this is a little different let's 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.579
 let's see how you really 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.759
 literally two scripts are needed 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.750
 which I am in the description of this video 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.329
 I will write a lesson and we need these scripts 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 insert in the terminal window as 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.729
 open the terminal program for us 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.540
 we can do it with faynder 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:06.479
 open the fader further open the programs 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.129
 we are looking for utility daddy here and here we are 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.830
 find the terminal window 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.770
 but I usually use spotlight search 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.200
 I click here and enter the word 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.990
 denomination press enter and thus 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.930
 much faster you can open that or 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.750
 another program and paste it in now 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.250
 code that will enable us to show hidden 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.550
 folders and files 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.940
 I have this code to not lose it 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.980
 forget copied yourself wrung out you too 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.000
 you can follow my advice and 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.910
 copy it out because 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 This script includes hidden files and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.340
 folders may come in handy in the future 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.750
 so I copied this script and wrapped 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.300
 and insert it here, press enter and all 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.820
 we have now as you see even here 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.000
 there are hidden on the desktop 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.430
 files and folders we can see them here i am 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.320
 went to download daddy and see what 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.520
 here 1 2 3 hidden files and even have 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.370
 hidden folder and let's say you installed 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.760
 I mean this script for photoshop 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.400
 or for some other program or 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.620
 did something when you needed 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.410
 the ability to display hidden files and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.010
 folders and now you want all the same 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.709
 data files 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.080
 Hidden you did not callus eyes and not 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.110
 interfered now we try 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.930
 the ability to disable this for us 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 I need another short code i 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.860
 he copied it again now from returned 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.440
 and insert it here in the terminal window 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.320
 insert click enter all display 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.660
 hidden files and folders have disconnected 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.300
 and if I open the folder again 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.860
 downloads we see that no hidden 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.470
 files and folders 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.260
 there is no well here I hope 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.580
 This advice will be useful to you in your 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.190
 I will insert the script in the description to 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.480
 lesson thank you for your attention with you 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.480
