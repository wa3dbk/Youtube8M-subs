I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.579 
I'm going to show you how to make
ravioli<00:00:02.399> using<00:00:03.060> wonton<00:00:03.480> wrapper<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:04.110> can

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
ravioli using wonton wrapper you can

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
ravioli using wonton wrapper you can
actually<00:00:04.770> make<00:00:05.190> two<00:00:06.180> different<00:00:06.480> sides<00:00:06.660> of

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
actually make two different sides of

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.040 
actually make two different sides of
ravioli<00:00:07.020> if<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.890> use<00:00:08.179> two<00:00:09.179> pieces<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.840> ton

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
ravioli if you use two pieces of one ton

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.320 
ravioli if you use two pieces of one ton
then<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.860> can<00:00:11.010> create<00:00:11.250> large<00:00:11.550> ravioli<00:00:12.059> you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
then you can create large ravioli you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.959 
then you can create large ravioli you
use<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> bottom<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.769> one<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> top

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
use one for the bottom and one for a top

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.830 
use one for the bottom and one for a top
if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.990> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> use<00:00:16.379> smaller<00:00:16.740> size<00:00:17.039> ravioli

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
if you want to use smaller size ravioli

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.689 
if you want to use smaller size ravioli
then<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.930> use<00:00:19.080> only<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.529> wonton<00:00:20.130> wrapper<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
then you use only one wonton wrapper and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.900 
then you use only one wonton wrapper and
then<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.300> fold<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:22.490> we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> make

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
then you fold it we're going to make

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
then you fold it we're going to make
smaller<00:00:24.210> size<00:00:24.480> ravioli<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.189> step

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
smaller size ravioli so the first step

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.710 
smaller size ravioli so the first step
is<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.599> brush<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.170> corner<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.310> dough<00:00:29.720> with

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
is to brush the corner of the dough with

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.350 
is to brush the corner of the dough with
egg<00:00:30.929> yolk<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.640> brushing<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> corner<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.149> very

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
egg yolk and brushing the corner is very

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.000 
egg yolk and brushing the corner is very
important<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:39.200> allow<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> regula<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> be

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
important so you allow the regula to be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.630 
important so you allow the regula to be
sealed<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> close<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.309> we're<00:00:44.309> using<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
sealed when you close it we're using a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.959 
sealed when you close it we're using a
year<00:00:44.820> burrata<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> soft<00:00:46.969> mozzarella

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
year burrata which is a soft mozzarella

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.889 
year burrata which is a soft mozzarella
cheese<00:00:48.410> we<00:00:49.410> place<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> end<00:00:50.899> we

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
cheese we place it on one of the end we

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.799 
cheese we place it on one of the end we
grab<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> corner<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.149> wonton<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
grab one of the corner of the wonton and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
grab one of the corner of the wonton and
then<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.770> fold<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.180> we're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
then we fold it over and then we're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
then we fold it over and then we're
going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> close<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.199> sides<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.010> start

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
going to close the two sides so I start

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.819 
going to close the two sides so I start
by<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.670> side<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> close<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
by one side and I'm going to close the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.539 
by one side and I'm going to close the
other<00:01:01.949> side<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> I'll<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> same<00:01:03.660> things

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
other side and I'll do the same things

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
other side and I'll do the same things
what's<00:01:05.549> important<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.420> push<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
what's important that you push all the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
what's important that you push all the
air<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> ravioli<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.780> no

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
air from the ravioli so you have no

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
air from the ravioli so you have no
bubble<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> poach<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:12.030> too<00:01:12.150> much

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
bubble when you poach them not too much

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
bubble when you poach them not too much
pressure<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.799> want<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
pressure also because you don't want to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.770 
pressure also because you don't want to
break<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> dough<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.360> place<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
break the dough and then you place it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
break the dough and then you place it
over<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> cutting<00:01:16.350> board<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
over the cutting board it's going to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
over the cutting board it's going to
take<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> few<00:01:18.060> minutes<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> egg<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
take a few minutes for the egg to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
take a few minutes for the egg to
activate<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> close<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> door<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
activate and close the door now that the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
activate and close the door now that the
ravioli<00:01:22.350> RCL<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.100> trim<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> ravioli<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> make

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
ravioli RCL I trim the ravioli to make

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.580 
ravioli RCL I trim the ravioli to make
them<00:01:24.509> look<00:01:24.630> nicer

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.140 

another<00:01:31.590> last<00:01:31.770> step<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.580> poach<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
another last step is to poach the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.220 
another last step is to poach the
ravioli<00:01:33.510> into<00:01:33.840> boiling<00:01:34.410> water

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.330 

the<00:01:40.230> ravioli<00:01:40.410> is<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.190> in<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the ravioli is going to see it in the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.480 
the ravioli is going to see it in the
water<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.640> about<00:01:41.880> two<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> three<00:01:42.390> minutes

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
water for about two to three minutes

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
water for about two to three minutes
because<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> dough<00:01:45.060> being<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.540> thin<00:01:45.810> they

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
because of the dough being so thin they

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.610 
because of the dough being so thin they
cooked<00:01:46.610> extremely<00:01:47.610> fast
