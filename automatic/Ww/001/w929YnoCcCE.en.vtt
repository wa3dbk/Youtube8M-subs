00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
about in my next video and when I show

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.090 
about in my next video and when I show
that<00:02:27.750> thing<00:02:27.900> off<00:02:28.020> um<00:02:28.800> let's<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.600> yeah

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that thing off um let's see yeah

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
that thing off um let's see yeah
one<00:02:32.100> downside<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.520> would<00:02:32.670> say<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.060> suit<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
one downside I would say to this suit is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.990 
one downside I would say to this suit is
the<00:02:34.020> zipper<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.830> back<00:02:34.920> zipper<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.820> don't

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the zipper in the back zipper it I don't

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.040 
the zipper in the back zipper it I don't
know<00:02:36.150> well<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:36.810> now<00:02:36.960> but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
know well you can see it right now but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.010 
know well you can see it right now but
that<00:02:37.230> goes<00:02:37.620> across<00:02:38.040> my<00:02:38.940> entire<00:02:39.420> back<00:02:39.690> right

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
that goes across my entire back right

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.370 
that goes across my entire back right
there<00:02:40.290> um<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.880> cool<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.050> doesn't

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
there um it's cool because it doesn't

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.340 
there um it's cool because it doesn't
split<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> spider<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.160> half<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:45.840> cool<00:02:46.140> like

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
split the spider in half it's cool like

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
split the spider in half it's cool like
that<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.400> downside<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.660> don't

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that but the downside is it is I don't

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.510 
that but the downside is it is I don't
know<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.320> kind<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> feel<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.070> zipper<00:02:50.370> it's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
know I can kind of feel the zipper it's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.680 
know I can kind of feel the zipper it's
a<00:02:50.580> little<00:02:50.820> uncomfortable<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.600> it's

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
a little uncomfortable but I think it's

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
a little uncomfortable but I think it's
one<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.840> those<00:02:51.930> things<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.200> get<00:02:52.380> used<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
one of those things that I get used to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.030 
one of those things that I get used to
also<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.660> red<00:02:54.990> line<00:02:55.230> from<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
also you can see this red line from the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.310 
also you can see this red line from the
zipper<00:02:56.460> goes<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.870> done<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.140> arms

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
zipper goes right there done the arms

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.200 
zipper goes right there done the arms
it's<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> huge<00:02:59.190> problem<00:02:59.490> but<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.060> know

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
it's not a huge problem but you know

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.120 
it's not a huge problem but you know
it's<00:03:00.450> kind<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.020> knowing<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.530> zipper<00:03:01.980> just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
it's kind of knowing the zipper just

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.510 
it's kind of knowing the zipper just
kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.780> flopped<00:03:03.780> there<00:03:04.110> which<00:03:04.430> kind<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
kind of flopped there which kind of

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.420 
kind of flopped there which kind of
sucks<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.970> mean<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.300> my<00:03:06.890> TASM<00:03:07.890> suit<00:03:08.160> it's

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
actually got these smaller zippers so

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.530 
actually got these smaller zippers so
they're<00:03:10.500> almost<00:03:10.680> invisible<00:03:11.210> also<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.240> can't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
they're almost invisible also I can't

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.150 
they're almost invisible also I can't
take<00:03:12.690> off<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> mask<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.710> because<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
take off the mask on this one because of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.640 
take off the mask on this one because of
that<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.090> actually<00:03:15.540> take<00:03:15.840> my<00:03:16.410> entire

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
that I have to actually take my entire

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.410 
that I have to actually take my entire
head<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.010> then<00:03:17.280> my<00:03:17.610> shoulders<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.150> all<00:03:18.210> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
head and then my shoulders and all that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.180 
head and then my shoulders and all that
is<00:03:18.660> exposed<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.710> ever<00:03:19.890> want<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.100> take

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
is exposed so if I ever want to take

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.680 
is exposed so if I ever want to take
softening<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.790> were<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> jacket<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:21.630> shirt

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
softening it were like a jacket or shirt

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.330 
softening it were like a jacket or shirt
underneath<00:03:22.140> or<00:03:22.350> something<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.420> um<00:03:24.420> I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
underneath or something like that um I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
underneath or something like that um I
will<00:03:26.340> probably<00:03:26.820> get<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> second<00:03:27.360> suit<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.600> this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
will probably get a second suit of this

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.740 
will probably get a second suit of this
with<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> mass<00:03:28.530> detachable<00:03:29.070> because<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.210> like

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
with the mass detachable because I like

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.500 
with the mass detachable because I like
that<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.740> think<00:03:32.340> with<00:03:32.460> just<00:03:32.820> about<00:03:32.970> every<00:03:33.330> suit

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that I think with just about every suit

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.570 
that I think with just about every suit
I<00:03:33.600> make<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.080> there's<00:03:34.410> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.740> be<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.370> first

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
I make is there's going to be the first

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.490 
I make is there's going to be the first
one<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.360> be<00:03:36.480> like<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.050> where<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
one is going to be like this where the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.990 
one is going to be like this where the
