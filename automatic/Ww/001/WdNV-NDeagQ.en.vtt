00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
here and it's a fairly sophisticated

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.030 
here and it's a fairly sophisticated
process<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.240> adjust<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.990> channel<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.620> this

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
have an on/off switch which sounds

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.910 
have an on/off switch which sounds
really<00:03:48.570> silly<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.020> mention<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:49.620> I've<00:03:49.740> noticed

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
really silly to mention but I've noticed

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.140 
really silly to mention but I've noticed
that<00:03:50.190> there's<00:03:50.370> actually<00:03:50.610> some<00:03:50.760> wireless

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that there's actually some wireless

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.280 
that there's actually some wireless
systems<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:51.630> there<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.810> don't<00:03:52.080> actually

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
systems out there that don't actually

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.950 
systems out there that don't actually
even<00:03:52.590> give<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.160> an<00:03:53.280> on/off<00:03:53.610> switch<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
even give you an on/off switch and a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.600 
even give you an on/off switch and a
volume<00:03:55.170> control<00:03:55.880> fairly<00:03:56.880> simple<00:03:57.300> fairly<00:03:57.990> easy

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
if I flip this around here you see on

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.360 
if I flip this around here you see on
the<00:04:01.860> back<00:04:02.010> panels<00:04:02.540> easily<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:04.590> equally<00:04:05.280> as

noise that you might have you kind of
you'll<00:04:17.700> find<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.060> happy<00:04:18.420> balance<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.960> where

you'll find that happy balance of where

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.660 
you'll find that happy balance of where
you<00:04:19.230> want<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.440> adjust<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.830> thing<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.580> know

what you don't want to adjust it too
high<00:04:22.290> because<00:04:22.890> I'll<00:04:23.130> start<00:04:23.310> cutting<00:04:23.430> things

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
high because I'll start cutting things

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.310 
high because I'll start cutting things
out<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.210> don't<00:04:24.450> want<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.050> don't<00:04:25.080> want

it<00:04:25.410> too<00:04:25.560> low<00:04:25.770> where<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.040> get<00:04:26.160> extra<00:04:26.430> noise

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
it too low where you get extra noise

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.580 
it too low where you get extra noise
it's<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.479> really<00:04:27.810> easy<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.200> not

to<00:04:51.030> get<00:04:51.150> hurt<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:52.140> all<00:04:52.290> built<00:04:52.620> into<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.160> which

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
to get hurt it's all built into it which

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.130 
to get hurt it's all built into it which
is<00:04:53.670> another<00:04:53.910> great<00:04:54.450> idea<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.690> key<00:04:57.690> points<00:04:58.050> I

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
is another great idea so key points I

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.220 
is another great idea so key points I
guess<00:04:58.350> here<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:59.880> a<00:05:00.060> great<00:05:00.360> system<00:05:00.660> it
