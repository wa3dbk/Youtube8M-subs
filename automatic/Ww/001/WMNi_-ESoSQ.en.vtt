00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.450
 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:15.090
 so uniquely wonderful on the same 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.439
 sort of opinel which 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.460
 positioned by the manufacturer as 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.029
 mushroom knife that is essentially it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.319
 highly specialized tool 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:30.880
 which is used in picking and god 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:33.640
 from here from his destination and follows him 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 so that's an unusual form of unusual 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.510
 geometry and strictly speaking 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 the whole knife his whole concept is built on 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 mushroom picker needs 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.230
 more about him handle traditionally for 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.969
 The panels are made of beech blades which 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.499
 used here made of 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 of stainless steel 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:02.190
 that is, in the classification api 0 this and Knox 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.620
 usual and pioneer 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 lock open close the lock and 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.210
 see here is such an unusual blade 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.110
 forms so curved sharp enough 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.990
 sharpened either for foam or out of the box 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.670
 here on the butt of the blade 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.710
 Here is such a wonderful sich 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.830
 which apparently should 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.120
 help hold this knife by some 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.450
 specific grip a whole like me 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.310
 seems to be the most typical grip of this our 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.910
 it will be like this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:57.100
 Hammer review that the knife is taken here 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:02:00.300
 this is how the mushroom is cut off with 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 on the other side of the handle we see a tassel 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.250
 which is used there for cleaning 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.310
 collected and god from garbage and here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 see lanyard hole 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.800
 Klitschko in the kit was not therefore 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.530
 the user of this knife people can 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.850
 insert any option here which 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.410
 the only thing that suits me is a little 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.580
 embarrassed that lanyard hole 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.440
 pretty and thin and so how 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.320
 seems to me the most optimal 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.010
 lanyard for this knife will be some 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.340
 the skin will begin brush handles pretty 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 tough how comfortable and will 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.960
 use yes and is it even possible 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.810
 honestly I never know 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.660
 used this knife as intended here 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.460
 but in principle, I think about that immediately 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.070
 same panel put here such a tool 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.090
 then it is quite possible that this 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:04.060
 tool will be quite useful on 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.720
 ring look marking is written here 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.490
 we have 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.060
 number eight does this mean by classification 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.120
 kinel 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.220
 that the length of the blade is 8 centimeters but 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.100
 due to its such very specific 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.530
 Geometry is hard to say here 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.310
 as far as this is true but quite possible 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.540
 that's the way it is 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.330
 Well, that's such a wonderful legs 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.370
 legs unique because few 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.270
 manufacturers such famous 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.500
 for example how to make knives 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.340
 so specific 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.030
 and so narrowly specialized itself by 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.860
 a knife causes a few 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.790
 ambiguous sensations on the one hand 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.940
 it is open and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:01.480
 this is the name of some brand that has 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.489
 their tradition have their own stable 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.959
 quality 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.670
 here on the other hand it's pretty 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:13.420
 unusual geometry that's unusual 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.440
 hold knife well as they say man 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.810
 gets used to everything 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.040
 he is not possible this knife is really 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.420
 useful for its intended purpose therefore 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:29.730
 waiting for summer in the fall and mushroom season 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.900
 and try to use this knife for 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.030
 gathering and buff 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.490
 what else would you like to say in this knife 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:44.040
 from the box very tightly opened 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.640
 the blade he walked with such tension 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.130
 I had to buy this particular sample 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.480
 because the store just them not 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:58.230
 it turned out it was the only copy 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.890
 here bring it home handled the knot 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.760
 the knife mounts with the handle were the chair and 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.860
 how much time has passed a day or two and a blade 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.830
 began to open everything is fine 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.200
 that is, the wood absorbed the pain table 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.490
 there appeared some kind of friction 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.250
 covering the result of the feet is wonderful 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.900
 wonderful opens and plus after 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.240
 treatment of pain 100th wood 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.270
 acquires some water repellent 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.490
 properties and therefore the grip 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.710
 Handle fixing markets not handles 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.120
 swells as fast as without this 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:47.310
 processing here what else would like 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:53.430
 say about this knife principle how do i 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:56.330
 it seems the knife is useful here so me 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.510
 it seems that he will be said to the court 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.890
 because he really is not anyhow 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:07.830
 it is interesting it would be desirable to really want 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.440
 use so why not 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.250
 why not because anyway 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.420
 when we go to eat mushrooms with us 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.190
 several knives 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.160
 why not use specially 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.630
 intended for this tool and 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.630
 then thank you all bye
