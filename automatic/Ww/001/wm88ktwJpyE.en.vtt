we open up the zipper you can see that

we open up the zipper you can see that
there<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:43.579> nice<00:01:44.579> lofty<00:01:45.479> baffle<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.290> behind

there is a nice lofty baffle in behind
the<00:01:46.920> zipper<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:47.939> any<00:01:48.180> cold<00:01:48.420> air

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the zipper so if there's any cold air

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.060 
the zipper so if there's any cold air
that<00:01:48.810> gets<00:01:48.899> through<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> zipper<00:01:49.409> itself<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that gets through the zipper itself it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
that gets through the zipper itself it
doesn't<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> interior

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
of the bag it's not a full length zipper

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.740 
of the bag it's not a full length zipper
I'd<00:01:55.200> call<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.740> three-quarter<00:01:56.579> length

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
I'd call it a three-quarter length

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
I'd call it a three-quarter length
zipper<00:01:57.750> again<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.189> improves<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
zipper again that that improves the

zipper again that that improves the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
where cold air can get to feet are

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.490 
where cold air can get to feet are
susceptible<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.149> cold<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.899> no<00:02:07.079> reason<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
susceptible to the cold so no reason to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
susceptible to the cold so no reason to
have<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.979> opening<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:08.729> nice<00:02:09.330> shaping<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
have that opening there nice shaping to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.760 
have that opening there nice shaping to
this<00:02:10.379> foot<00:02:10.709> box<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
this foot box so you

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.280 
this foot box so you
it<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.190> maintain<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.760> natural<00:02:13.510> position

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it can maintain a natural position

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710 
it can maintain a natural position
within<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.650> bag<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.700> nice<00:02:15.880> comfort
