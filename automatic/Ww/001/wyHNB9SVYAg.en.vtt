00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.330
 welcome to the explanatory film 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.950
 pressure in the water in this explanation 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.410
 film we have prepared a trial 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.180
 He calls himself hydrostatic buoyancy 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.000
 as well as a summary with the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.100
 results from it we start now with 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 the trial construction 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.710
 we need for this experiment 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 measuring cup four small frames one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 base plate with pondering a force knife 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 the power knife is put together 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 from a district with a rubber ring 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 a washer then we have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 joint roll and dowel the whole 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 attached to a hole died important 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.149
 is still a potato that it is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 weight with which we use the whole 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.090
 will be attached to one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 you need that thread first of all 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.280
 the whole frame and dowels and prepares 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.520
 the following three construction 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 components before even two frames the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.610
 are loosely attached and once two 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 Frame the right angle with each other 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.299
 were plugged in from these three 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.590
 components and the base plate 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.810
 Now you need the following bracket 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 This bracket must be well fastened 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 be on the base plate itself and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.850
 attached to it then the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.250
 Power knife is important that the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.040
 pay are so constructed that you can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.950
 good reading and if you like the whole 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.340
 then you can prepare the object 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.710
 that you want to attach to it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.720
 prepare the twine well 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.750
 the potato cling and the potato 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.090
 do not come out of the fortification 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.689
 It is recommended that you can see that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.060
 here grilling enter into it then the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.659
 string and the whole thing 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.549
 is more stable so now it goes to the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.590
 actual execution one takes there 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.739
 Now the potato is attached to this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.730
 power knives and although attached this way 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 that the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.370
 Stoffel just above the ground of the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.040
 You can float through the cup 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 subordinate to books 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.299
 both at measuring cup and at 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.379
 frame you can change the height that 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.739
 this optimal and now reads the value 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.360
 the weight on the power knife off 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.910
 to do that you fill up to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 Brand 100 milliliters of water in the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.250
 measuring cup and also reads from what 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.860
 the power knife reveals 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.110
 this looks like the following example what 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.910
 one recognizes here is that the value 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.220
 slightly increased 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.780
 So apparently the potato is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.829
 lighter weight than the weight 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.739
 has lost weight 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.810
 that means somehow the mass of the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.340
 potato has become smaller than her 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170
 is not going down so much anymore 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.660
 drawn 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.329
 what is behind it is the so-called 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.470
 Archimedean principle in liquids 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.920
 like ours, for example, in the water 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.840
 the body loses weight and power 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.660
 this loss of weight is 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 equal to the weight force since 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.220
 displaced fluid and this 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.139
 principle this is called hydrostatic 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 so buzzes this principle that uses the 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.849
 shipping because only so can 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.010
 actually ships on the surface 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.530
 Although we are talking about here 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.280
 buoyancy and in comparison to the weight 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.690
 of the body, the buoyancy is greater than 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.000
 the weight of the body 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.099
 then the body just dives so deep 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.870
 until the displaced liquid quantity 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.239
 just as much as the body weighs 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.579
 even that is for example one 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.620
 ship the case when the buoyancy 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.269
 balance slightly in the weight of 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.549
 body is then hovering in the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.989
 liquid and when the uplift that 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.120
 is the force that acts from below 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.250
 weaker is smaller than that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.680
 weight of the body then the body goes 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.620
 down and therefore have shipbuilders 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.769
 always make sure that the buoyancy 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 the steel of the ship is bigger than that 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.660
 weight of steel because only then can 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.970
 drive the ship on the surface 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.040
 so with this know again the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.770
 key information in a nutshell 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.350
 By the Archimedean principle sinks 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.150
 apparently the weight of 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.790
 Body fluids this is seemingly 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.520
 very important because of the 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.440
 buoyancy something changes but 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.660
 not really easy weight 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
 fizzles and this loss 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.560
 weight is just as big as that 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.440
 weight of the repressed 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.170
 liquid and this weight loss 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.780
 It is called hydrostatic 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.290
 designated and, for example, in 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.330
 Shipbuilding should only be applied 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.230
 please ask , then please contact 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.120
 the online support 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.570
 we wish a lot of fun with the others 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.570
