00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.660 
good there's a lot of air pressure being
built<00:06:38.800> up<00:06:38.920> in<00:06:39.010> this<00:06:39.100> sauce<00:06:39.310> because<00:06:39.550> it's

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
built up in this sauce because it's

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.340 
built up in this sauce because it's
still<00:06:39.880> hot<00:06:39.910> that's<00:06:40.300> why<00:06:40.450> I<00:06:40.480> recommend<00:06:41.050> doing

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
still hot that's why I recommend doing

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.890 
still hot that's why I recommend doing
it<00:06:41.650> letting<00:06:42.190> it<00:06:42.370> cool<00:06:42.580> down<00:06:42.760> and<00:06:43.060> also<00:06:43.750> once

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
it letting it cool down and also once

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.210 
it letting it cool down and also once
you<00:06:43.960> put<00:06:44.140> it<00:06:44.230> in<00:06:44.290> here<00:06:44.440> still<00:06:44.680> keep<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:45.010> top

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
you put it in here still keep the top

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.990 
you put it in here still keep the top
off<00:06:45.430> but<00:06:46.030> if<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.210> notice<00:06:46.540> it's<00:06:46.840> kind<00:06:47.590> of<00:06:48.000> super

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
off but if you notice it's kind of super

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.190 
off but if you notice it's kind of super
liquidy<00:06:49.150> but<00:06:49.450> it's<00:06:49.570> kind<00:06:49.720> of<00:06:49.750> liquidy

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
liquidy but it's kind of liquidy

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.780 
liquidy but it's kind of liquidy
whatever<00:06:50.800> it<00:06:50.920> is<00:06:50.980> right<00:06:51.160> now<00:06:51.280> when<00:06:51.460> it's<00:06:51.610> hot

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
whatever it is right now when it's hot

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.820 
whatever it is right now when it's hot
when<00:06:52.330> it<00:06:52.420> cools<00:06:52.480> it's<00:06:52.960> going<00:06:53.110> to<00:06:53.170> thicken<00:06:53.440> up<00:06:53.680> a

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
when it cools it's going to thicken up a

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.680 
when it cools it's going to thicken up a
bit<00:06:54.010> so<00:06:54.490> this<00:06:54.640> is<00:06:54.730> actually<00:06:55.000> a<00:06:55.030> really<00:06:55.390> good

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
bit so this is actually a really good

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.720 
bit so this is actually a really good
consistency<00:06:56.050> but<00:06:56.590> it's<00:06:56.740> going<00:06:56.890> to<00:06:56.950> be<00:06:57.130> perfect

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
consistency but it's going to be perfect

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:05.280 
consistency but it's going to be perfect
once<00:06:58.000> it<00:06:58.150> cools<00:06:58.390> down<00:07:03.300> that<00:07:04.300> is<00:07:04.450> good<00:07:04.720> barbecue

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
once it cools down that is good barbecue

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.320
