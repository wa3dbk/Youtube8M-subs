00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
development where they you know we

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.839 
development where they you know we
inherited<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:20.769> all<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.610> source

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
inherited from them all of the source

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.960 
inherited from them all of the source
code<00:02:22.120> all<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.140> engine<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.040> core

code all of the the engine that the core

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.710 
code all of the the engine that the core
assets<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.629> characters<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.080> whatnot<00:02:27.720> which

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
assets the characters and whatnot which

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.770 
assets the characters and whatnot which
is<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.319> pretty<00:02:29.709> strong<00:02:30.510> foundation<00:02:31.510> right<00:02:31.750> i

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
is a pretty strong foundation right i

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.930 
is a pretty strong foundation right i
mean<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.530> started<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.340> source<00:02:33.579> code<00:02:33.790> in

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
mean we started with the source code in

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.330 
mean we started with the source code in
assets<00:02:34.420> from<00:02:35.049> one<00:02:35.409> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> highest<00:02:36.129> rated

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.890 
assets from one of the highest rated
games<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.790> time<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.180> our<00:02:37.299> launching<00:02:37.720> point

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
games of all time as our launching point

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750 
games of all time as our launching point
that's<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.200> pretty<00:02:38.409> strong<00:02:38.860> base<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.610> launch

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that's a pretty strong base to launch

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.509 
that's a pretty strong base to launch
from<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:41.049> then<00:02:41.230> from<00:02:41.500> then<00:02:41.920> they've<00:02:42.489> been

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
from and then from then they've been

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.670 
from and then from then they've been
excellent<00:02:43.030> technical<00:02:43.420> resources<00:02:44.079> when<00:02:44.470> we

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
excellent technical resources when we

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.740 
excellent technical resources when we
had<00:02:44.829> questions<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.489> how<00:02:46.120> certain<00:02:46.450> pieces

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
had questions about how certain pieces

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.750 
had questions about how certain pieces
of<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.170> code<00:02:47.410> worked<00:02:47.739> or<00:02:47.980> how<00:02:48.099> certain<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
of the code worked or how certain you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.849 
of the code worked or how certain you
know<00:02:48.849> design<00:02:49.299> principles<00:02:49.989> were<00:02:50.140> set<00:02:50.620> up<00:02:50.650> or

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
know design principles were set up or

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.240 
know design principles were set up or
whatnot<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.879> nobody<00:02:52.870> ever<00:02:53.140> wanted<00:02:53.769> them<00:02:54.010> or
