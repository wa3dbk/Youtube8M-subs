00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
away from the edge just a little bit it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.790 
away from the edge just a little bit it
shouldn't<00:05:07.750> be<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.870> problem<00:05:07.930> if<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.440> left<00:05:08.650> it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800
