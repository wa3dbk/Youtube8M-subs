00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 you lose a shorter cool project 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 I recommend to subscribe to see 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.340
 vidosik here can credit him zdarova 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 thugs with you panda whether it is midone 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.500
 the all pick press system each picks that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.500
 wants and in my opinion you need to pick 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 good heroes they are not all there 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 there 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 rikimaru for example and so in the team have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.280
 we have first and took three columns 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 honestly this is a very cool initiator 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.399
 It turns out in this context 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 because he runs everything starts 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 gouge spikes spines spines oh hey 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.460
 oh oh e shorter peak cool next peak 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.079
 we have a phantom lancer and here we need 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 note that the person is quickly nafarmil 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.770
 Vladimir and, accordingly, had 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.390
 opportunity to pass I agree it is not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
 the most stop and fact on the phantom lancer 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.410
 and generally country from the facts about this lancer 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.039
 but in this case it was necessary to quickly 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 eat and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 Vladimir consider surrender quite cope 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.519
 our next hero is necrophos or not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.020
 trolls great passivka which 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.460
 really burns plus the opportunity behind 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.090
 to heal the allies is really cool 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 really helped us in this battle 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.240
 our next hero is an ogre magician to be honest 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.130
 This is the most controversial peak in our team. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.590
 because well, sort of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.729
 there is a multicast camp but I don't 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.009
 sure that this is a cool hero in this 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.439
 mode and generally afraid except by mages 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 doesn't always end well 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.799
 king midone ilyich us team for my 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 request he peep it is very good 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.520
 the conclusion against us is playing rikimaru i 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.290
 I think it 's still a solo hero 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.820
 Targets in the medallion very if not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.470
 count the clouds. of course in the batch 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 helps but i wouldn't say that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 strongly important thing next 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 The hero of the device is ult excellent but in general 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.890
 on chilling wants to be helping too but 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 frankly variable not sure what 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.990
 apparatus methods very good enigma like 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.240
 Pushes like a forester is a good option for my 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 look you can take it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.290
 wellness can and not take phantom 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.080
 assassin is absolutely stupid rush because 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.600
 this late is a powerful light and here 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.250
 escape it has of course certain yes 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.290
 can kritanut but by and large 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.920
 there is no particular sense in the metal from it 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.780
 taken in vain 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.070
 but also vivir again, I do not think it is 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.990
 the coolest hero 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.900
 true again excellent escape due to 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.090
 Ulta watt per hour saw cos0 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.220
 peak is not very clear victory in general we 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 here on the peak such fights will be more because 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.340
 that in my opinion this mode is enough 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 interesting think someone pikat also 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 you can comment all five 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 peeped in honey mode 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.940
 all pick if different heroes and lucky
