through our Mornay at the last minute

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.520 
through our Mornay at the last minute
there's<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.569> flat<00:02:38.569> end<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.959> pointy<00:02:39.230> end<00:02:39.260> on

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
there's a flat end and a pointy end on

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.559 
there's a flat end and a pointy end on
an<00:02:39.650> egg<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.489> oak<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.790> probably<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.480> be

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
an egg the oak is probably going to be

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.550 
an egg the oak is probably going to be
sitting<00:02:41.959> at<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.590> flat<00:02:43.160> end<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.140> cut<00:02:45.380> it

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
sitting at the flat end if you cut it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.130 
sitting at the flat end if you cut it
this<00:02:45.769> way<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.970> point<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.720> knife<00:02:47.900> at

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
this way with the point of the knife at

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.930 
this way with the point of the knife at
the<00:02:48.260> flat<00:02:48.500> end<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.920> draw<00:02:49.190> your<00:02:49.459> knife<00:02:49.610> back

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the flat end and draw your knife back

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.180 
the flat end and draw your knife back
through<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.720> won't<00:02:51.200> tear<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.709> bottom<00:02:52.040> out

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
through it it won't tear the bottom out

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.059 
through it it won't tear the bottom out
of<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.489> egg<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.110> it'll<00:02:54.110> keep<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.470> more<00:02:54.650> intact

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
of the egg and it'll keep it more intact

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.880 
of the egg and it'll keep it more intact
so<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.849> keep<00:02:56.060> drawing<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.510> knife<00:02:56.959> towards

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
so you keep drawing the knife towards

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.150 
so you keep drawing the knife towards
you<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.850> way<00:02:59.030> the<00:03:00.019> egg<00:03:00.109> will<00:03:00.319> retain<00:03:01.100> its

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
you and that way the egg will retain its

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.030 
you and that way the egg will retain its
shape<00:03:01.640> better<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.510> put<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.530> point<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
shape better so put the point of the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.880 
shape better so put the point of the
knife<00:03:04.220> up<00:03:04.819> at<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> flat<00:03:05.390> end<00:03:05.569> push<00:03:06.530> through

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
knife up at the flat end push through

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.360 
knife up at the flat end push through
and<00:03:07.310> pull<00:03:07.700> back<00:03:07.880> towards<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.889> white

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and pull back towards you and the white

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.800 
and pull back towards you and the white
part<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.880> egg<00:03:10.970> will<00:03:11.180> actually<00:03:11.480> clean<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
part of the egg will actually clean the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.090 
part of the egg will actually clean the
knife<00:03:11.959> on<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.200> way<00:03:12.380> through<00:03:12.590> rather<00:03:12.920> than

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
knife on the way through rather than

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.340 
knife on the way through rather than
drag<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.639> delicate<00:03:14.060> yolk<00:03:14.269> through<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:15.170> see

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
drag the delicate yolk through you see

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.160 
drag the delicate yolk through you see

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.099 
to cook this through you just want to
make<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.100> little<00:03:37.220> bit<00:03:37.400> translucent<00:03:38.109> and

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
make it a little bit translucent and

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.539 
make it a little bit translucent and
then<00:03:39.260> we're<00:03:39.350> going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.560> drain<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.069> off<00:03:40.190> and

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
then we're going to drain it off and

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.670 
then we're going to drain it off and
make<00:03:41.060> our<00:03:41.299> white<00:03:41.600> sauce<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.260> our<00:03:42.290> morning

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
make our white sauce for our morning

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.910 
make our white sauce for our morning
just<00:03:43.670> keep<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:44.030> moving<00:03:44.359> around<00:03:44.569> about<00:03:45.530> two

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
just keep it moving around about two

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.910 
just keep it moving around about two
minutes<00:03:46.130> our<00:03:46.519> onions<00:03:46.940> are<00:03:47.120> starting<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.920> wilt

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
minutes our onions are starting to wilt

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.520 
minutes our onions are starting to wilt
down<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.310> little<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:49.940> sweeten<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.260> we<00:03:51.380> can

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
down a little and sweeten up so we can

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.410 
down a little and sweeten up so we can
remove<00:03:51.980> them<00:03:52.190> from<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.519> pan<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.030> sand<00:03:53.269> them

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
remove them from the pan and sand them

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.559 
remove them from the pan and sand them
to<00:03:53.510> one<00:03:53.630> side<00:03:54.700> drag<00:03:55.700> them<00:03:55.880> as<00:03:56.000> best<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.359> can

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569

from<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.840> bottom<00:03:57.139> these<00:03:57.380> are<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.799> be

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
from the bottom these are going to be

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.349 
from the bottom these are going to be
returned<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.459> pan<00:03:58.670> in<00:03:58.790> anyway<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.090> it

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
returned to the pan in anyway so it

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.879 
returned to the pan in anyway so it
doesn't<00:03:59.389> matter<00:03:59.630> if<00:03:59.989> there<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.349> violet<00:04:00.680> left

quite salty turn that off now and we're
going<00:05:24.259> to<00:05:24.350> flake<00:05:24.680> our<00:05:24.919> fish<00:05:25.160> because<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.460> was

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
going to flake our fish because it was

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.700 
going to flake our fish because it was
too<00:05:25.729> hot<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:25.970> do<00:05:26.240> any<00:05:26.389> sooner<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> can<00:05:27.590> go

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
too hot to do any sooner and it can go

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.890
