00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
a tour of beta 3 because it's a pretty

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.320 
a tour of beta 3 because it's a pretty
major<00:00:05.910> overhaul<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.529> game<00:00:08.030> first<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.210> all

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
major overhaul to the game first of all

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.980 
major overhaul to the game first of all
the<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:11.040> influence<00:00:11.730> tear<00:00:12.090> your<00:00:12.269> light<00:00:12.540> area

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the your influence tear your light area

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
the your influence tear your light area
of<00:00:13.049> control<00:00:13.440> now<00:00:13.620> matters<00:00:14.040> ate<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> lot<00:00:14.639> because

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of control now matters ate a lot because

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.590 
of control now matters ate a lot because
you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.529> now<00:00:16.680> build<00:00:16.949> any<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.670> anything<00:00:18.060> that's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
you can now build any on anything that's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
you can now build any on anything that's
in<00:00:18.840> your<00:00:18.990> area<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.470> control<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.609> there's<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in your area of control so if there's a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
in your area of control so if there's a
gold<00:00:21.180> mine<00:00:21.740> well<00:00:22.740> first<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.189> should<00:00:23.369> say

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
gold mine well first of all I should say

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.189 
gold mine well first of all I should say
the<00:00:23.699> research<00:00:24.029> resource<00:00:24.630> system<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> now

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the research resource system is now

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.830 
the research resource system is now
different<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:26.250> cities<00:00:26.699> other<00:00:27.510> than<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
different your cities other than a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.640 
different your cities other than a
handful<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:29.310> early<00:00:30.199> basic<00:00:31.199> things<00:00:31.500> like

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
handful of very early basic things like

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.290 
handful of very early basic things like
an<00:00:31.890> arcane<00:00:32.279> lab<00:00:33.860> don't<00:00:34.860> generate<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.090> their

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
an arcane lab don't generate on their

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.280 
an arcane lab don't generate on their
own<00:00:36.680> research<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.420> arcane<00:00:39.420> knowledge<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:40.050> even

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
own research or arcane knowledge or even

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.700 
own research or arcane knowledge or even
money<00:00:40.590> rather<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.989> multiply<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.290> improve

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
money rather they multiply they improve

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.369 
money rather they multiply they improve
on<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.340> improvements<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:45.870> imply<00:00:46.079> that's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on as improvements it would imply that's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.660 
on as improvements it would imply that's
how<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.890> shoot<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.219> working<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
how they shoot them working from the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
how they shoot them working from the
beginning<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.539> improve<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.190> resources

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
beginning they improve on what resources

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.110 
beginning they improve on what resources
you<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.410> example<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.789> gold

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you have so for example I have a gold

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
you have so for example I have a gold
mine<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.649> world<00:00:55.829> has<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.340> more

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
mine here so we the world has a lot more

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
mine here so we the world has a lot more
resources<00:00:57.120> hanging<00:00:57.570> around<00:00:57.840> many<00:00:58.350> many

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
resources hanging around many many

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
resources hanging around many many
different<00:00:58.739> types<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> need<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> gold<00:01:00.449> mine

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
different types so I need this gold mine

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.770 
different types so I need this gold mine
which<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> build<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.210> gets

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
which I build on and that then gets

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380 
which I build on and that then gets
magnified<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.700> markets<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> kind

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
magnified by markets and all that kind

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.340 
magnified by markets and all that kind
of<00:01:06.450> thing<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:07.850> similarly<00:01:08.850> ah<00:01:09.110> if<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of thing in the game similarly ah if I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
of thing in the game similarly ah if I
want<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:11.010> arcane<00:01:11.880> knowledge<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.570> need<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
want to have arcane knowledge I need to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.770 
want to have arcane knowledge I need to
build<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.729> los<00:01:14.729> libraries<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.659> now

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
build on los libraries which are now

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200 
build on los libraries which are now
scattered<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.820> around<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> map

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
scattered of much more around the map

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
scattered of much more around the map
and<00:01:18.710> similarly<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.340> arcane<00:01:20.850> knowledge

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and similarly if I want arcane knowledge

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
and similarly if I want arcane knowledge
or<00:01:21.630> I've<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.200> technology<00:01:22.560> knowledge

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
or I've so that's technology knowledge

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.090 
or I've so that's technology knowledge
arcane<00:01:23.580> knowledge<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:25.100> ancient

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
arcane knowledge there are ancient

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.050 
arcane knowledge there are ancient
temples<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> map<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.229> so

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
temples around the map that do that so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.490 
temples around the map that do that so
those<00:01:30.060> things<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.659> where<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.350> your

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
those things are where you get your

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.950 
those things are where you get your
stuff<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.610> cities<00:01:33.060> magnify<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
stuff and then your cities magnify that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
stuff and then your cities magnify that
so<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.439> why<00:01:34.670> having<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.030> build<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so that's why having what you build in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.819 
so that's why having what you build in
your<00:01:36.600> city<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.049> matters<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> need<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
your city now matters you need to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.560 
your city now matters you need to
specialize<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.970> city<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.420> they're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
specialize your city because they're

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
specialize your city because they're
associated<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.380> whatever's<00:01:41.310> closest<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
associated with whatever's closest to it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
associated with whatever's closest to it
so<00:01:42.540> whichever<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.259> closest<00:01:43.770> city<00:01:43.970> eventually

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so whichever is closest city eventually

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.020 
so whichever is closest city eventually
going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> allow<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.250> probably<00:01:47.250> switch

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
going to allow you to probably switch

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
going to allow you to probably switch
where<00:01:48.329> they<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.780> magnifying<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
where they are magnifying and have a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.440 
where they are magnifying and have a
distance<00:01:50.369> penalty<00:01:50.700> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.000> asteroid

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
distance penalty kind of like asteroid

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.050 
distance penalty kind of like asteroid
fields<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.840> galactic<00:01:52.170> civilizations<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.790> by

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
fields and galactic civilizations but by

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.139 
fields and galactic civilizations but by
changing<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.689> makes<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> air<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
changing this makes a I and we air you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.870 
changing this makes a I and we air you
control<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.350> interesting<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.670> as

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
control much more interesting because as

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.920 
control much more interesting because as
we<00:02:00.030> zoom<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.750> where

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
we zoom out here I can see like where

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600 
we zoom out here I can see like where
the<00:02:04.079> bad<00:02:04.259> guys<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> good<00:02:04.860> guys<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.219> now

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the bad guys and the good guys are now

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
the bad guys and the good guys are now
that<00:02:05.850> there's<00:02:06.180> turf<00:02:06.509> wars<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that there's turf wars because the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.520 
that there's turf wars because the
controlling<00:02:08.879> these<00:02:09.030> areas<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:10.229> means

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
controlling these areas it means

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.229 
controlling these areas it means
something<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:11.280> right<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.550> people<00:02:12.150> are

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
something all right there people are

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.520 
something all right there people are
fighting<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.750> get

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
fighting to get

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.010 
fighting to get
influence<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.330> far<00:02:15.569> into<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
influence going I'm pretty far into this

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.380 
influence going I'm pretty far into this
so<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.040> some<00:02:17.220> really<00:02:17.490> bad<00:02:17.819> monsters

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so there are some really bad monsters

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.510 
so there are some really bad monsters
starting<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> come<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
starting to come out in this so that's a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.490 
starting to come out in this so that's a
big<00:02:24.030> thing<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.390> how<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> economy's<00:02:25.260> change

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
big thing about how the economy's change

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.740 
big thing about how the economy's change
and<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.160> natural<00:02:26.670> result<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and what the natural result is it is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.380 
and what the natural result is it is
that<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> gets<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.890> early<00:02:29.280> game<00:02:29.520> moving<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.209> lot

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that it gets the early game moving a lot

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.380 
that it gets the early game moving a lot
faster<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.860> first<00:02:32.280> let<00:02:33.000> me<00:02:33.030> find

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
faster because that first let me find

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.800 
faster because that first let me find
that<00:02:34.260> first<00:02:34.590> Art<00:02:34.830> Loss<00:02:35.730> library<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.630> an

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that first Art Loss library as an

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.590 
that first Art Loss library as an
example<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:37.800> forgotten<00:02:38.130> temple<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
example so that's forgotten temple the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.449 
example so that's forgotten temple the
really<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.989> get<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.319> your<00:02:43.560> research<00:02:44.190> going

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
really will get you your research going

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
really will get you your research going
early<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.780> later<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.380> flattens<00:02:46.800> out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
early and then later on it flattens out

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.350 
early and then later on it flattens out
a<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.430> because<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.790> can't<00:02:48.030> just

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
a little bit because you can't just

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.500 
a little bit because you can't just
build<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.200> zillion<00:02:49.650> cities<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:51.150> crazy

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
build a zillion cities and have crazy

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.620 
build a zillion cities and have crazy
amounts<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.080> research<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.830> only<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> still

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
amounts of research the only you still

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.720 
amounts of research the only you still
get<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> study<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.709> provide<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.250> one

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
get the study and I provide you with one

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
get the study and I provide you with one
you<00:02:57.540> know<00:02:57.630> technology<00:02:58.260> resource<00:02:58.590> which<00:02:58.769> is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you know technology resource which is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.130 
you know technology resource which is
basically<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.430> joke<00:02:59.850> there's<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.540> scenic<00:03:00.930> view

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
basically a joke there's a scenic view

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.699 
basically a joke there's a scenic view
anything<00:03:01.470> fuse<00:03:01.890> provides<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.090> with

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
anything fuse provides you with

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.470 
anything fuse provides you with
influence<00:03:04.709> points<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:09.000> beyond<00:03:09.300> that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
influence points but I that beyond that

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120 
influence points but I that beyond that
your<00:03:09.690> cities<00:03:09.989> aren't<00:03:10.170> actually<00:03:10.530> generating

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
your cities aren't actually generating

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
your cities aren't actually generating
this<00:03:11.280> stuff<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.720> makes<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.080> big

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
this stuff so that makes a big

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.370 
this stuff so that makes a big
difference<00:03:14.180> i<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.660> i<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:16.080> missing

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
difference i see i have some missing

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.110 
difference i see i have some missing
tiles<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> look<00:03:17.400> into<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.670> in

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
tiles and have to look into that in

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.160 
tiles and have to look into that in
temple<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:21.269> I'm<00:03:21.360> right<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:21.930> going

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
temple so I'm right now I'm going

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.870 
temple so I'm right now I'm going
through<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.470> I'm<00:03:22.560> finding<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.190> missing

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
through it I'm finding all the missing

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
through it I'm finding all the missing
tiles<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.420> bugs<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.930> stuff<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.320> preparation

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
tiles and bugs and stuff in preparation

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.380 
tiles and bugs and stuff in preparation
for<00:03:26.100> tomorrow<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.090> interesting

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
for tomorrow but it's interesting

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.120 
for tomorrow but it's interesting
because<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:28.350> players<00:03:28.769> since<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:31.530> eye<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
because as players since the the eye and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.770 
because as players since the the eye and
that<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.489> actually<00:03:32.790> make<00:03:32.940> use<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.480> stuff

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that can actually make use of this stuff

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.310 
that can actually make use of this stuff
see<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.049> got<00:03:34.320> some<00:03:34.530> graphic<00:03:34.950> issues<00:03:35.310> here

may want to go some other route you know
because<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.450> what<00:03:55.350> resources<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.160> are<00:03:56.549> able

to make best use of and now there's a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.860 
to make best use of and now there's a
reason<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.769> expand<00:03:59.130> because<00:03:59.570> getting<00:04:00.570> control

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
reason to expand because getting control

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.660 
reason to expand because getting control
of<00:04:00.930> these<00:04:01.140> isn't<00:04:01.500> by<00:04:01.620> cities<00:04:02.070> but<00:04:02.370> by

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
of these isn't by cities but by

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.020 
of these isn't by cities but by

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
and see these aren't the cranking how

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.860 
and see these aren't the cranking how
much<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.760> sees<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.090> not<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.420> best<00:04:09.570> way<00:04:09.720> to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
much it sees is not the best way to

much it sees is not the best way to
maximize<00:04:10.799> your<00:04:11.280> territory<00:04:11.850> because<00:04:12.269> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
maximize your territory because the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.740 
maximize your territory because the
higher<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.500> quality<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.980> city<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.430> more

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
higher the quality of the city the more

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.199 
higher the quality of the city the more
it<00:04:15.750> goes<00:04:15.989> out<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.820> said<00:04:17.970> we'll

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it goes out and and like I said we'll

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.539 
it goes out and and like I said we'll
have<00:04:18.359> things<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.780> even<00:04:19.140> go<00:04:19.459> expand<00:04:20.459> it

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
have things that I even go expand it

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.529 
have things that I even go expand it
beyond<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.060> kind<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.269> interesting

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
beyond but it's kind of interesting

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.200 
beyond but it's kind of interesting
