our base this is where everything

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.330 
our base this is where everything
stabilized<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> front<00:00:43.800> portion

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340

like this is our core you know our Tom's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.029 
like this is our core you know our Tom's
right<00:00:49.140> other<00:00:49.320> things<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.680> build<00:00:49.860> everything

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
right other things we build everything

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.170 
right other things we build everything
back<00:00:50.449> he's<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:51.690> 30<00:00:51.989> inch<00:00:52.170> curved<00:00:52.440> bars<00:00:53.180> for

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
back he's using 30 inch curved bars for

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.930 
back he's using 30 inch curved bars for
the<00:00:54.270> sides<00:00:55.070> these<00:00:56.070> leg<00:00:57.000> supports<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:59.670> front

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the sides these leg supports this front

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
the sides these leg supports this front
crossbar<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.989> high<00:01:01.670> but

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
crossbar is not gonna be this high but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
crossbar is not gonna be this high but
this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.510> easy<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.010> get<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.129> hype

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this is very easy to get your hype

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
this is very easy to get your hype
figured<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.740> bar<00:01:07.950> at

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
figured out if you just put the bar at

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
figured out if you just put the bar at
the<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.220> top<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.750> clamp<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.380> top

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the very top the clamp to the very top

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
the very top the clamp to the very top
of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> bar<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.060> doing<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> I'm

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of the bar so what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
of the bar so what I'm doing is I'm
rotating<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> bar<00:01:16.290> backwards<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
rotating the bar backwards because I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
rotating the bar backwards because I
need<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> bar<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> horizontal<00:01:20.040> plane

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
need the bar to be on a horizontal plane

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
need the bar to be on a horizontal plane
as<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> mad<00:01:21.360> laying<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.259> imaginary

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
as if it's mad laying on an imaginary

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
as if it's mad laying on an imaginary
tabletop<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.060> all<00:01:24.270> points<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> bar

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
tabletop so that all points in the bar

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
tabletop so that all points in the bar
are<00:01:25.080> flat<00:01:25.320> usually<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.729> call<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
are flat usually like it's I call it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
are flat usually like it's I call it
three<00:01:27.900> point<00:01:28.170> leveling<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> middle

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
three point leveling you know the middle

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
three point leveling you know the middle
point<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.079> measure<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> middle

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
point if you just measure the middle

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
point if you just measure the middle
point<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.549> could<00:01:32.670> show<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.090> level<00:01:33.360> but

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
point it could show that it's level but

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
point it could show that it's level but
it<00:01:34.439> may<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.950> level<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.549> may<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it may not be level that just may be the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.270 
it may not be level that just may be the
top<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> arc<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.560> bottom<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> the

top of the arc or the bottom of the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
top of the arc or the bottom of the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
smile you know that's always going to be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
smile you know that's always going to be
level<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.189> real<00:01:41.430> test<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
level there the real test to see if it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
level there the real test to see if it's
level<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.049> gonna<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.380> level<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.950> both

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
level is if it's gonna be level on both

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
level is if it's gonna be level on both
ends<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.700> level<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.000> both<00:01:45.030> ends<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
ends if it's level on both ends and in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.910 
ends if it's level on both ends and in

do something about this okay so we can

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.820 
do something about this okay so we can
position<00:01:55.520> these<00:01:55.760> times<00:01:56.440> get<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.530> height<00:01:57.710> of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
position these times get the height of
