it<00:00:08.010> into<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> waste<00:00:08.519> line<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.030> toilet<00:00:12.080> now

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it into the waste line the toilet now

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.220 
it into the waste line the toilet now
we're<00:00:13.200> looking<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.620> penetration<00:00:14.990> into<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
we're looking for a penetration into the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're looking for a penetration into the
crawlspace<00:00:31.130> we've<00:00:32.130> got<00:00:32.279> some<00:00:32.489> pipes<00:00:32.730> running

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
crawlspace we've got some pipes running

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
crawlspace we've got some pipes running
through<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.480> already<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.230> gonna<00:00:34.350> be

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
through it already so it's gonna be

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.459 
through it already so it's gonna be
pretty<00:00:34.649> easy<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.130> knock<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.520> break<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.469> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
pretty easy to knock this break out to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
pretty easy to knock this break out to
get<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> three<00:00:37.920> inch<00:00:38.100> PVC<00:00:38.719> drain<00:00:39.719> pipe<00:00:40.110> through

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
get a three inch PVC drain pipe through

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.150 
get a three inch PVC drain pipe through
the<00:00:42.440> penetration<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> dryer<00:00:47.039> vent

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the penetration here with the dryer vent

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
the penetration here with the dryer vent
is<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.020> scary<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is going out which is kind of scary to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.939 
is going out which is kind of scary to
me<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> length<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.710> into

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
me because all the length is going into

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.700 
me because all the length is going into
the<00:00:53.039> crawlspace<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:53.969> side

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
the crawlspace and the other side

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
the crawlspace and the other side
creates<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> fire<00:00:56.730> hazard<00:00:56.760> we

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
creates a little bit of a fire hazard we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.979 
creates a little bit of a fire hazard we
brought<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.430> customers<00:00:59.430> attention

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.039 

so<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.409> continue<00:01:05.960> priming<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so we're just gonna continue priming and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
so we're just gonna continue priming and
gluing<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.439> pipe<00:01:07.650> until<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> out

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
gluing up pipe until we get it out

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
gluing up pipe until we get it out
through<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> hole<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.439> enough

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
through that hole there we have enough

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
through that hole there we have enough
room<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.549> Jay<00:01:14.900> cut

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
room to get out there right now Jay cut

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800 
room to get out there right now Jay cut
that<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> tearing<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> hole

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
that will make a tearing out the hole

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.039 
that will make a tearing out the hole
once<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.960> turn<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:23.360> another<00:01:24.360> elbow<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.930> the
