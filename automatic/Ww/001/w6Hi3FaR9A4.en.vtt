00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.840
 hi friends from youtube I'm line in 1992 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.969
 Well today I liked to give them 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 a new announcement today begins 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.279
 officially the new contest what in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.770
 this year the theme is going to be halloween 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.420
 I make this video with anticipation 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 so that you can have the time 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.460
 enough to be good good after 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 I will give the specifications and do 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.199
 the bases of the contest the prizes and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.789
 we all now go with the questions that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.930
 they started the previous video and then 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.930
 we continue with magical 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.570
 first what in what I saw like this was 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.199
 the cartoons of today a video that he did 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.500
 the antichrist 2007 a long time ago I 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 I saw him in 2008 and since then I 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.159
 I like what I did not live much criticism 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.559
 rebel to the guy animated to those 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.330
 programs staying in that time and then 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.720
 I started watching the green diets videos 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 in 1987, well that's one of my 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.670
 greater inspirations to do the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.670
 videos 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 I like case 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.799
 not the truth I do not like to use I do not know 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.799
 I see well 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.260
 if a lot of people ask me why I 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.180
 I spend so much time making videos and good 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.570
 I think this has not been said before 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.370
 I'm in college and well you guys 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.659
 they know that I took a lot of time and 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.880
 everything but 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.619
 well I also try that my videos 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.429
 remain with the best quality 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.369
 possible for you but of course that is 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.740
 a process that takes quite clear 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.959
 I would like to upload videos every week could 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.579
 do it but it would not be the same 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.579
 quality all with shops 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.370
 no no no no i have 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 no no no no no no 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.290
 Y 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.290
 how can you ask me to imitate the troll 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.490
 Maybe you do not know what to copy is bad 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.890
 how it came out 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
 all right 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.360
 here ends are the days if you have a 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.360
 problem that in the front 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 efe 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.110
 well I had never really thought about it 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.569
 but a few days ago he came to my page 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.220
 official on facebook a message where I 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.810
 they ask that if I want to appear in one 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:16.370
 of surveillance videos 15 and good 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.019
 even since if I met him in a 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.540
 large whole lot together with pablo east and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.090
 95 and long until 86 is to take origin if 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 all more so well this 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.769
 attribute put also and mine by itself 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.190
 perhaps I appeared in some of his 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.190
 videos 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.359
 good if I had thought about that too 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.400
 when I started with the channel but good 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:48.000
 I 've never done it 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.769
 so if I think that if in 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.500
 next weeks could begin to 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.159
 record something that the first hints 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.750
 about clear legends for the games 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.959
 with the five best scenes that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.569
 movie stories but when everything 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.250
 it depends on the time you have so 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.250
 Stay tuned with my channel 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.900

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.060
 contest is going to be the special of 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.100

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.630
 personally a special Christmas and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.700
 probably for the day of san 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 valentine of 2014 I will make a 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.390
 Valentine's day special where 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.120
 the principals are obviously going to be 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.490
 toy and rose 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.810
 and good friends that would be the questions 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.540
 that I will answer in this video 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.120
 now let's move on to the contest 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.639
 good salmon all those who want 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.820
 participate must put their name on the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.870
 comments box down there 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.670
 well there is not a minimum of subscribers 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.190
 the theme should be halloween by 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.500
 course and should be done with gta san 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 andreas and what he entered can 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.240
 include parts of other video games 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.680
 clear but it has to be gta san 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.620
 andreas 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.930
 also something else the screeners are 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.969
 prohibited 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.650
 well I do not like them either but 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:14.860
 nobody likes to see us like this so every 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.160
 any video that I hope you have 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.190
 a your first one is going to be disqualified 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.100
 so let's go to the brakes on 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.480

 know but at least those are the ones 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.620
 what there is now is not necessary to have 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.910
 a minimum number of subscribers the 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.610
