00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.290
 you remember that we have ever done 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.120
 a chapter of the always flower begonias 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.630
 Today I'm going to show you the begonia 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.759
 dragon 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.230
 this would be the argon of always flower and 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.110
 is the dragon begonia for you to see 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.079
 what differences of plants are weighed 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.850
 that the two are begonias one being 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.579
 already tiny starts to bloom and the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.199
 another the goya dragon has to catch 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.380
 some height already stops to get to 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.740
 to flourish 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.590
 It is a plant that looks its flowers from 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.260
 April to November sometimes up 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.100
 December depending on the arrival of 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.770
 the cold needs a spongy soil 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.140
 loose or sandy although also in the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.120
 Soils a little clayish is a plant 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.740
 what is hard to do but also 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.060
 develops well and is a plant that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.729
 can reach approximately between 50 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.300
 60 70 centimeters high for late 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.710
 of the season and has a bloom 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.450
 continuously and constantly once 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.850
 begins to appear does not stop blooming 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.590
 until they kill cold and all 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.900
 the plants that have to give a lot 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.650
 flower the best orientations are the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.930
 this the south and the southwest to the north is 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.780
 a plant that does not develop well 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 It stretches too much and also usually has 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.060
 ear problems one of botrytis if 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.670
 we have a very rainy summer as it is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.190
 a fast growing plant and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.680
 also an abundant flowering 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.380
 the plant that requires many nutrients 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.750
 and in turn also needs a lot 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.360
 water at least once a week 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 we have to give clear vitamins in the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.070
 water or once a month if the granulate is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 Water supply has to be 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 approximately once or twice to the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 week everything depending on the area in the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 that is oriented and the heat that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.460
 let's have that week the plagues that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.800
 they usually attack these plants 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.410
 usually they are snails and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.870
 the slugs and early in the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.820
 spring also in the lungs the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 snails you know it's easy to 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.740
 remove them by applying a granulate 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.230
 every 15 days as well and the aphids 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.810
 also apply an insecticide to a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.860
 once a month and you always have the plants 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 a little bit prevented that they can 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 well we have another very hard plant for 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.700
 the summer season of a lot of sun and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.760
 lack of water the dragon begonia is another 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.990
 of these plants that we can almost 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.370
 do not worry about her do not des 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.350
 worry totally but almost 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.440
 do not worry about her 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.440
