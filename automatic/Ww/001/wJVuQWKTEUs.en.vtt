I'm sure this night we'll try it on and
see<00:00:04.319> but<00:00:04.649> I<00:00:04.919> think<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.669> goes<00:00:05.819> like<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.390> the

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
see but I think it goes like this on the

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.509 
see but I think it goes like this on the
horse<00:00:06.749> it<00:00:07.639> goes<00:00:08.639> through<00:00:08.969> here<00:00:09.799> what<00:00:10.799> we<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.130> is

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
horse it goes through here what we do is

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.909 
horse it goes through here what we do is
we<00:00:12.059> put<00:00:12.299> it<00:00:12.389> over<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.780> head<00:00:12.990> particularly

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:13.919 
we put it over the head particularly

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.530 
we put it over the head particularly
this<00:00:14.009> one<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.519> can't<00:00:14.730> open<00:00:14.879> up<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.209> front

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
let me put up on the front but we still

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.550 
let me put up on the front but we still
could<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.400> over<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> head<00:00:18.200> so<00:00:19.200> what<00:00:19.290> you<00:00:19.380> want

she doesn't get up the shot dangled

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
she doesn't get up the shot dangled
under<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.010> stomach<00:01:21.020> um<00:01:22.910> put<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.240> turn<00:01:25.050> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
under the stomach um put it in turn this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
under the stomach um put it in turn this
sideways<00:01:26.090> push<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.690> then<00:01:27.869> flip

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
sideways push it through and then flip

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
sideways push it through and then flip
it<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.560> fold<00:01:28.800> like<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.850> part<00:01:30.090> just

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it so fold like that this part just

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.540 
it so fold like that this part just
listed<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.900> little<00:01:30.990> snugger<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.800> then<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
listed a little snugger and then the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.749 
listed a little snugger and then the
back<00:01:32.729> ones<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.210> similar<00:01:35.060> around<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.360> leg

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
back ones are similar around one leg

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.969 
back ones are similar around one leg
through<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.619> then<00:01:40.729> twist<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.479> then

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
through and then twist it in and then

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.960 
through and then twist it in and then
tight<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.400> only<00:01:44.550> thing<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:44.910> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
tight and then the only thing that's a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.320 
tight and then the only thing that's a
little<00:01:45.000> weird<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.729> twist<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.940> back<00:01:48.090> ones

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
little weird I twist the back ones

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.999 
little weird I twist the back ones
around<00:01:48.660> each<00:01:48.780> other<00:01:48.929> so<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> loop

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
around each other so I'm going to loop

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.990 
around each other so I'm going to loop
this<00:01:50.160> one<00:01:50.399> through<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> other<00:01:50.970> leg<00:01:53.000> before

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
this one through the other leg before

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400 
this one through the other leg before
bringing<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.990> doing<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> same

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
bringing it around and doing the same

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.630 
bringing it around and doing the same
thing<00:02:01.220> all<00:02:02.220> right

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
thing all right

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
thing all right
so<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.000> since<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.690> cold<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.050> will

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
so now since it's not that cold I will

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
so now since it's not that cold I will
undo<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.679> which<00:02:05.069> will<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.429> reverse<00:02:05.789> like

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
undo it which will just reverse like

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.470 
undo it which will just reverse like
there's<00:02:11.150> maybe<00:02:13.010> nothing

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
there's maybe nothing

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.790 
there's maybe nothing
okay<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.190> see<00:02:17.190> they're<00:02:18.560> always<00:02:19.560> around

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
hour reminding me

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.730 
hour reminding me
now<00:02:24.780> they're<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:28.330> legs<00:02:28.870> force<00:02:29.170> back<00:02:29.500> legs

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
now they're here so legs force back legs

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.240 
now they're here so legs force back legs
first

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
first

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.380 
first
yeah<00:02:30.460> just<00:02:30.670> make<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:30.970> much<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.270> difference

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
yeah just make that much of a difference

a bullet over mm-hmm

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.640 
a bullet over mm-hmm
barely<00:02:36.370> strap<00:02:36.640> off<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.560> we

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
barely strap off and then so that we
