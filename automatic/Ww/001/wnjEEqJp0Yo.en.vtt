00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880 
year with the new secrets and spies line
we<00:00:17.770> found<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:19.210> were<00:00:19.840> playing<00:00:20.260> there<00:00:20.560> were<00:00:20.680> less

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
we found we were playing there were less

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.350 
we found we were playing there were less
you<00:00:21.220> know<00:00:21.310> interested<00:00:21.670> in<00:00:21.760> like<00:00:21.910> shooting<00:00:22.300> at

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
you know interested in like shooting at

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.060 
you know interested in like shooting at
each<00:00:22.390> other<00:00:22.600> and<00:00:22.960> playing<00:00:23.470> more<00:00:23.710> but<00:00:23.980> they

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
each other and playing more but they

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.200 
each other and playing more but they
were<00:00:24.160> envisioning<00:00:24.520> themselves<00:00:24.610> as<00:00:24.970> spies<00:00:25.180> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
were envisioning themselves as spies and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.870 
were envisioning themselves as spies and
secret<00:00:25.720> agents<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.920> idea<00:00:27.130> behind<00:00:27.280> that<00:00:27.520> is

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
secret agents so the idea behind that is

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.480 
secret agents so the idea behind that is
that<00:00:27.910> we've<00:00:28.180> tied<00:00:28.390> an<00:00:28.510> element<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.020> story<00:00:30.010> into

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
that we've tied an element of story into

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.429 
that we've tied an element of story into
the<00:00:30.520> line<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.720> cool<00:00:31.900> thing<00:00:32.079> about<00:00:32.110> all<00:00:32.259> these

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
the line the cool thing about all these

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.170 
the line the cool thing about all these
blasters<00:00:32.950> is<00:00:33.310> that<00:00:33.550> you'll<00:00:34.060> see<00:00:35.430> red<00:00:36.430> all<00:00:37.120> over

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
blasters is that you'll see red all over

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.500 
blasters is that you'll see red all over
these<00:00:37.630> that's<00:00:38.050> because<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:40.060> blasters

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
these that's because all of the blasters

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.210 
these that's because all of the blasters
in<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.720> line<00:00:40.899> will<00:00:41.079> be<00:00:41.200> featuring<00:00:41.620> secret

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
in the line will be featuring secret

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.550 
in the line will be featuring secret
message<00:00:42.520> darts<00:00:42.880> or<00:00:43.239> arrows<00:00:43.780> depending<00:00:44.350> on<00:00:44.470> the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
message darts or arrows depending on the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.639 
message darts or arrows depending on the
product<00:00:44.890> then<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.370> separate<00:00:45.760> decoder<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
product then a separate decoder so the

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.049 
product then a separate decoder so the
idea<00:00:47.920> behind<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.520> that<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.910> girls

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
idea behind that is that you know girls

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.420 
idea behind that is that you know girls
can<00:00:49.390> share<00:00:49.690> there's<00:00:50.130> gadgets<00:00:51.130> and

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
then anything on the top the red feature

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.479 
then anything on the top the red feature
the<00:00:58.899> integrated<00:00:59.440> decoder<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.190> can<00:01:00.340> shoot

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the integrated decoder so you can shoot

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.520 
the integrated decoder so you can shoot
messages<00:01:00.940> back<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.149> forth<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:02.290> is<00:01:02.379> one<00:01:02.500> of
