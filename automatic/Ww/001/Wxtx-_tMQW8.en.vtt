to straighten up your wrap loop at all

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.370 
to straighten up your wrap loop at all
now<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.319> time<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:12.870> okay<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:13.930> first

now is the time to do it okay so first

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.009 
now is the time to do it okay so first
ones<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.769> there<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.849> go<00:02:16.660> back<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> your

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
ones on there now go back to your

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.680 
ones on there now go back to your
project<00:02:17.319> earring<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.010> count<00:02:18.819> how<00:02:18.970> many<00:02:19.150> links

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
project earring and count how many links

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.150 
project earring and count how many links
there<00:02:19.989> are<00:02:20.110> between<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.500> one<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.130> just

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
there are between the one that we just

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.520 
there are between the one that we just
put<00:02:21.489> on<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.870> pad<00:02:22.870> parasha<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.410> that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
put on and the pad parasha one that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
put on and the pad parasha one that
we're<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.799> put<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.040> next<00:02:24.459> well<00:02:24.760> looks

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
we're going to put on next well looks

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.400 
we're going to put on next well looks
like<00:02:25.540> there's<00:02:25.810> three<00:02:26.319> links<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.799> between<00:02:28.410> so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
like there's three links in between so

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.750 
like there's three links in between so
let's<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:29.829> head<00:02:29.980> pin<00:02:30.190> attached<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
let's get our head pin attached to the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.229 
let's get our head pin attached to the
crystal<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.340> begin<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.640> make<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.880> wrapped<00:02:34.150> loop

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
crystal and begin to make a wrapped loop

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.430 
crystal and begin to make a wrapped loop
just<00:02:34.769> like<00:02:35.769> before<00:02:39.569> now<00:02:40.569> go<00:02:40.900> back<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.109> this

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
just like before now go back to this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.420 
just like before now go back to this
project<00:02:41.980> earring<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:43.890> count<00:02:44.890> how<00:02:44.950> many<00:02:45.069> links

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
project earring and count how many links

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.910 
project earring and count how many links
between<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.000> second<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.600> third<00:02:46.920> again

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
between the second and the third again

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.900 
between the second and the third again
it's<00:02:48.519> three<00:02:48.910> links<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:51.190> take<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.489> last<00:02:51.670> head

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
it's three links so take your last head

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.059 
it's three links so take your last head
pin<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.299> your<00:02:52.810> last<00:02:52.930> crystal<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.859> one

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
pin and your last crystal this one

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.650 
pin and your last crystal this one
happens<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.730> Pacific<00:02:55.090> opal<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:57.660> make

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
happens to be the Pacific opal and make

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.190 
happens to be the Pacific opal and make
your<00:02:58.840> last<00:02:59.200> wrapped<00:02:59.739> loop<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:01.239> right<00:03:01.569> now<00:03:02.139> we

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
your last wrapped loop all right now we

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.879 
your last wrapped loop all right now we
have<00:03:02.500> all<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.829> our<00:03:03.010> crystals<00:03:03.430> on<00:03:03.670> our<00:03:04.359> chain

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
have all of our crystals on our chain

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.890 
have all of our crystals on our chain
now<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:05.980> final<00:03:06.250> step<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.450> take<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.750> ear

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
now the final step is to take the ear

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.110 
now the final step is to take the ear
wire<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.350> attach<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.489> last<00:03:09.730> link

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
wire and attach it to the one last link

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.180 
wire and attach it to the one last link
on<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.500> free<00:03:11.709> end<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.160> chain<00:03:13.889> now<00:03:14.889> since

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
on the free end of the chain now since

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.949 
on the free end of the chain now since
this<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.819> regular<00:03:16.030> playing<00:03:16.480> ear<00:03:16.780> wire

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
this is just a regular playing ear wire

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.690 
this is just a regular playing ear wire
you're<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> open<00:03:17.769> up<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.040> loop<00:03:18.280> just

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
you're going to open up this loop just

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.110 
you're going to open up this loop just
as<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:18.970> would<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.470> jump<00:03:20.470> ring<00:03:20.970> simply<00:03:21.970> take

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
as you would a jump ring simply take

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.699 
as you would a jump ring simply take
your<00:03:22.180> chain<00:03:22.480> nose<00:03:22.540> or<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.380> even<00:03:23.470> take

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
your chain nose or you can even take

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.530 
your chain nose or you can even take
your<00:03:23.859> round<00:03:23.980> nose<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.970> you're<00:03:25.090> going<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.269> open

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
your round nose and you're going to open

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.149 
your round nose and you're going to open
up<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> loop<00:03:25.959> off<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> side

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.119 

take<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.310> link<00:03:35.489> put<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.569> on<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.989> loop<00:03:37.849> and

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
take the link put it on to the loop and

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.839 
take the link put it on to the loop and
then<00:03:41.129> close<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.970> loop<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.780> ear<00:03:42.930> wire

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
then close the loop on the ear wire

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.640 
then close the loop on the ear wire
there<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:44.940> go<00:03:45.290> matching<00:03:46.290> pair<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.470> earrings

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
there you go matching pair of earrings

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.490 
there you go matching pair of earrings
to<00:03:47.040> go<00:03:47.069> along<00:03:47.340> with<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.610> bracelet<00:03:48.349> that<00:03:49.349> you

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
to go along with the bracelet that you

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.070 
to go along with the bracelet that you
just<00:03:49.799> made

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.140 

you
