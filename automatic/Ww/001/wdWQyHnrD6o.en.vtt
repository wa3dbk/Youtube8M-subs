00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.199
 Welcome to our party like 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.720
 Today you have a special theme and 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.430
 Although it is about American products 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.740
 and their labeling what's in it 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 compared to the ladies' products 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.779
 European German products 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.940
 I have a number of products 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.010
 chosen in front and become known and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.640
 Let's start with that 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.699
 differences understands esm is a very 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.949
 well-known product are six tastes 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.900
 excellent because of the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.600
 americans it is so the information 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.820
 to be done per serving that means you 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.129
 do not know how we are 100 grams 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.930
 Contain the processes that is 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.540
 of course not the only scale for 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.430
 quality but if of course I do that 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.979
 sexy and then also counts on 44 22 times 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.210
 then the product definitely bites 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.060
 more than 50 percent than the first guess 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.330
 other things still stuff around and so 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.730
 First I was already better off 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.480
 So there I have a part of not 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:28.990
 because even at 2 60% portions 24 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.990
 optimum edition offers 1 81 percent 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.350
 on 100 grams and our this policy 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:40.690
 that one still 380 the higher the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.830
 of course, the coal processes are lower 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.630
 therefore contributes and earns that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.470
 important is analogue from the he should be there 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.450
 So already on it eighth 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 december is that will be difficult 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.540
 another aspect of Balkan 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.580
 Products is how partial that should be 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.010
 you just written on everything small 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 as partial ingredients indicated 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.750
 I will have chosen just so 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.570
 only that does not explain everything badly 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.540
 is the good 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.690
 So the work is a workout booster 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.350
 applications regeneration etc 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 there it is, we have one here too 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.590
 plant on portion and then we have 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.320
 given vitamins per serving and that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.640
 proofreading so protein content and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.600
 coal needs a share of the words 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.550
 but then it starts then you have 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.640
 the additives the corresponding 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.890
 listed below and then there is reha 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.470
 brand8000 80,000 million equivalent to 80 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.150
 came it is divided into different 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:57.620
 So groups creating the amazing blend 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.250
 and jacques brel and the tecdax fell 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.340
 our choice 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.650
 the problem is thanks to be groups 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.769
 formed and weekly content information 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.920
 but not in the gram 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:16.320
 quantity or claim the quantity but 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.190
 is only available in berlin downloads 10.2 grams and 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.769
 then he will do all the things 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.370
 So you do not know why 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.560
 goods are now in or what they think 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.350
 Your turn or how much of Africa is in it 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.080
 But that's the whole length together 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.610
 written and then it was the money 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.050
 European products and Germany 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.480
 is that different then you have the duty 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.880
 the indication to make 100 km and one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.519
 also came 17 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.080
 which substance among other things also low 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.510
 get more is included 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.540
 there seemed or ingredient and then must 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.250
 always that the stock masters them 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.549
 keep it first as well 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.799
 so if i like to group the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.019
 list an important ingredient hands 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.130
 and before that is still sweeteners rom 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.760
 I can always build from that 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.269
 go out that of this important substance 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.130
 so relatively little is included 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.450
 he adds to that 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.400
 American products often 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.739
 Additives inside are those in europe 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.950
 allowed 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 partly it is so specific 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.400
 Products taken off the market as 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.680
 especially what problems with certain 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.510
 additives the fti that is the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.650
 Controlling americas belong to the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.389
 to pay attention to sin 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.110
 We will make the peel here 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.480
 It's different in Europe that one 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.550
 Safe work specific ingredient lists 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.290
 Every manufacturer as well as note that 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.780
 You can then certainly in the substances 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.120
 Definitely use with the line too 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 uncut 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.080
 meral substances specific compound and 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.699
 Certain things just not that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.240
 not so explored or not 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.620
 last are in America as I said 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.229
 this is often said differently 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.370
 additional knows nothing and therefore 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:09.440
 if we just have all the questions and me 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.889
 I think that necessarily asks us 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.169
 simply we are stuck at the hamster 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.810
 you are welcome to contact us and we are 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.280
 just so damp to protect 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.919
 American products are increased 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.130
 value in the market here and throw that 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.620
 some women keep coming back then so 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.300
 until next time I would be happy 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.039
 if you announce and we are the me 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.979
 again with a new theme 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.139
 it's about testo booster what is 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.789
 allowed what is there what happens 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.300
 because every day you can do it all 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.199
 believe 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:50.590
 which products bring what okay then 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.590
 until next time and trained
