now<00:01:48.720> obviously<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.980> has<00:01:50.190> slept<00:01:50.760> down

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
now obviously that has slept down

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.920 
now obviously that has slept down
somehow<00:01:52.790> they<00:01:53.790> say<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> exact

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
somehow they say is in the exact

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
somehow they say is in the exact
position<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:58.320> soon<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> moved

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
position that it was as soon as I moved

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
position that it was as soon as I moved
this<00:02:00.180> whole<00:02:00.420> thing<00:02:00.720> out<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.980> I'm<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
this whole thing out so I'm going to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.400 
this whole thing out so I'm going to
reposition<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.180> hopefully<00:02:03.900> get<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.080> stuck

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
reposition that hopefully get it stuck

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.180 
reposition that hopefully get it stuck
back<00:02:04.650> in<00:02:04.680> place<00:02:05.210> permanently<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
back in place permanently so that I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.760 
back in place permanently so that I
could<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.610> put<00:02:08.820> this<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.770> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
could just put this back in and that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
could just put this back in and that
will<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:10.980> ok<00:02:11.250> ok<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.960> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
will be ok ok here we are then this is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.530 
will be ok ok here we are then this is
just<00:02:13.350> about<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> end<00:02:14.190> result<00:02:14.760> now<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.240> really

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
just about the end result now you really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
just about the end result now you really
can't<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.050> disc<00:02:16.340> too<00:02:17.340> much<00:02:17.610> anymore

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
can't see the disc too much anymore

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.570 
can't see the disc too much anymore
because<00:02:18.210> it's<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.140> center<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.890> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
because it's right in the center of this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.910 
because it's right in the center of this
which<00:02:20.820> we've<00:02:21.060> got<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.270> held<00:02:21.480> down<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.230> some

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
which we've got it held down with some

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.090 
which we've got it held down with some
bonding<00:02:23.310> agent<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.940> use<00:02:24.560> once<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.830> at

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
bonding agent that we use once it's at

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.270 
bonding agent that we use once it's at
its<00:02:26.400> incredibly<00:02:27.060> strong<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.830> disc<00:02:29.040> won't

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
its incredibly strong so the disc won't

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.990 
its incredibly strong so the disc won't
move<00:02:29.460> anymore<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.350> say<00:02:31.850> that's<00:02:32.850> pretty

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
move anymore but as I say that's pretty

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.640 
move anymore but as I say that's pretty
much<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.420> place<00:02:33.630> i'm<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.990> waiting<00:02:34.350> for<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
much in place i'm just waiting for it to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.520 
much in place i'm just waiting for it to
dry<00:02:34.710> now<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.150> once<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.510> dry<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:37.380> can

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
dry now so that once it's dry we can

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.200 
dry now so that once it's dry we can
reconstruct<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.220> iphone<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.820> test<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
reconstruct the iphone and test the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.260 
reconstruct the iphone and test the
button<00:02:39.570> ok<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:40.620> let's<00:02:40.830> hear<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.340> bonding

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
button ok then let's hear the bonding

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.270 
button ok then let's hear the bonding
agent<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.840> used<00:02:43.110> has<00:02:43.910> set<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.290> dry

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
agent that we used has set now it's dry

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.100 
agent that we used has set now it's dry
not<00:02:47.610> sticky<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.720> we're<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.050> to

testing the phone now now to confirm the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.570 
testing the phone now now to confirm the
feel<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.360> back<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.980> botton<00:03:27.310> feels

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
feel is back so the botton feels

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.820 
feel is back so the botton feels
absolutely<00:03:27.760> fine<00:03:28.330> as<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.440> see<00:03:29.650> it's

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
absolutely fine as you can see it's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.440 
absolutely fine as you can see it's
switched<00:03:30.100> on<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.760> looks<00:03:30.790> like<00:03:31.030> it's

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
switched on so it looks like it's

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.430 
switched on so it looks like it's
working<00:03:31.510> again<00:03:32.310> now<00:03:33.310> while<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.850> problem<00:03:34.180> was

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
working again now while the problem was

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.980 
working again now while the problem was
there's<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.530> very<00:03:35.800> small<00:03:35.980> sort<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.660> circle<00:03:37.660> disk

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
there's a very small sort of circle disk

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.700 
there's a very small sort of circle disk
on<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.550> top<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> actual<00:03:40.990> switch<00:03:41.290> itself

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
on the top of the actual switch itself

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.080 
on the top of the actual switch itself
had<00:03:42.040> slipped<00:03:42.400> down<00:03:43.440> from<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:44.860> being

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
had slipped down from just it being

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.900 
had slipped down from just it being
repeatedly<00:03:46.090> pressed<00:03:46.770> with<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:48.070> that's<00:03:48.430> had

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
repeatedly pressed with that that's had

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.650 
repeatedly pressed with that that's had
taken<00:03:49.300> away<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.600> feel<00:03:49.840> from<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:50.770> botton<00:03:51.310> and
