00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.779
 how about friends welcome to the route 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.380
 green here on youtube today must 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 practice on a note that you already do 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.210
 Several days ahead Gabriel Valero 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 via facebook sent us information to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.949
 respect and is that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.309
 as we progress in the 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.739
 technology we are moving away many 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.449
 sometimes not always of nature in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.660
 this occasion is spoken comes from the flesh 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.989
 well created in the laboratory totally 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.339
 based on stem cells have announced and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.340
 they have indeed made a press conference 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.800
 international in which 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.580
 Well, how can you see 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.900
 they have cooked meat created in the wharton 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.750
 and it is no longer meat made of an animal 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.409
 but if it's meat that somehow 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.479
 it was to create what consequences can 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.460
 have where this whole future is going 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.540
 according to these scientists in 10 or 20 years 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.990
 meat can be supplied in the zones 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.990
 Well, more needed so that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.890
 so that they do not destroy the remaining fauna 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.610
 in some areas especially in places 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 where I assaulted her is not possible for me 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 it makes me all this is more 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 an incredible business that they are thinking 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.260
 in the future and who will be trying to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.300
 save costs without thinking about 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.420
 consequences that this may cause 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.280
 type of product you know many tricks 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 that are still consumed in many 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 European countries especially are 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 banned for many years but 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.630
 in america especially in latin america 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 they continue to be consumed apparently with 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.569
 fairly complete nutrients when there 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.329
 long- term consequences 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.959
 we have to rethink things as 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.030
 we are trying to solve the 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.510
 crisis that there are food of a 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.980
 more sustainable way thanks to all 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.409
 those who send us comments like 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.810
 gabriel who went ahead several days to 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.180
 this information and many of you know 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.519
 who are in last of the trends and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.019
 I appreciate all your cooperation 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's continue causing the change that in the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.040
 green route until soon
