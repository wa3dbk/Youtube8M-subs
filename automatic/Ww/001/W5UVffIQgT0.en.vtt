00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.800
 welcome to italian cakes in this 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.199
 video we will show you how to cover one 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.730
 cake with sugar paste 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.699
 we prepared some sponge cake 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.490
 stuffed and we placed on a 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.769
 food cardboard disk between the 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.659
 cardboard and the tray on which it will come 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.339
 presented the cake 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.860
 we put sheets of paper 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.309
 silvered to prevent that in the phase of 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.050
 preparation get the tray dirty 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.239
 we covered the cake with the cream 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.109
 of butter and in the first phase much 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.449
 important 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.600
 let's level the surface of the 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.960
 cake and also clearly the sides of the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960
 cake 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.619
 the sides of our cake 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.880
 be well straight because the cover 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.880
 be perfect 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.950
 soak the spatula in boiling water 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.229
 and we continue with this kind of 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.080
 processing until the surface 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.400
 it will be perfectly straight 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.470
 one time 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.150
 added the desired effect we can 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.150
 remove the silver paper 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.959
 let's spread the sugar paste 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.239
 and we use corn starch to make 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.970
 so that the dough does not stick to 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.920
 plan 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 if air bubbles form 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 we can eliminate them with one 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.680
 toothpick 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.060
 we roll the dough on the sea 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.060
 we prepare for coverage 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.349
 at this stage we only use our hands 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.209
 to try to make the pasta adhere to 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.209
 butter cream sugar 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.010
 what matters at this stage to avoid that 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.209
 folds are formed 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.209
 in the sugar paste 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.280
 then slowly 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.190
 when we see that they are formed 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 folds we go to roll out the dough of 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.740
 sugar and reposition it in contact 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.090
 with the butter cream 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.090
 so as you see 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.610
 in the image we reposition the pasta 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.610
 if the fold is formed again 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.390
 we reposition it to eliminate it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390
 all the folds 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 as soon as possible we are going to eliminate 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.250
 the excess of pasta 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.960
 we are abundant 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.610
 and we eliminate the excess of pasta that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.610
 certainly annoys the processing 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.129
 still proceed in the same way 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.540
 when we eliminated 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.750
 all the defects we can start at 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:51.449
 work the edges with the smooth air with 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.460
 these fast movements 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.110
 utilization 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.940
 the swivel top is still helping the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.440
 sugar paste to adhere 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.440
 perfectly to the cake 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.210
 done this again we eliminate 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.210
 the excess remaining slightly 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 plentiful 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.020
 we still work as a bar 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.020
 orca with the scooter 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.530
 if there are excesses of pasta 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.530
 let's eliminate for the last time 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.360
 and the coverage is finished
