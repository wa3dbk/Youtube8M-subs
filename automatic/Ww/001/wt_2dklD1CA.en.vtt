on our BRZ quite a bit we've done a
bunch<00:00:27.610> of<00:00:27.760> suspension<00:00:28.270> mods<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:28.720> one<00:00:28.930> of<00:00:29.020> my

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
bunch of suspension mods to it one of my

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.500 
bunch of suspension mods to it one of my
biggest<00:00:29.320> complaints<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.070> how<00:00:30.550> soft<00:00:30.970> all<00:00:31.360> the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
biggest complaints is how soft all the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.500 
biggest complaints is how soft all the
factory<00:00:31.869> bushings<00:00:32.020> are<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.730> those<00:00:33.850> very

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
factory bushings are one of those very

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.149 
factory bushings are one of those very
soft<00:00:34.839> factory<00:00:35.230> bushings<00:00:35.379> or<00:00:35.679> the<00:00:35.829> rear<00:00:35.980> diff

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.159 
soft factory bushings or the rear diff

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:37.860 
soft factory bushings or the rear diff
cushion<00:00:36.579> you<00:00:36.699> just<00:00:36.850> get<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:36.999> ton<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.329> play<00:00:37.659> in<00:00:37.719> it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
cushion you just get a ton of play in it

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
cushion you just get a ton of play in it
so<00:00:38.050> something<00:00:38.289> like<00:00:38.409> this<00:00:38.679> is<00:00:38.829> going<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.489> be

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so something like this is going to be

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.299 
so something like this is going to be
absolutely<00:00:40.719> amazing<00:00:41.019> what<00:00:41.829> this<00:00:41.979> does<00:00:42.159> is

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
absolutely amazing what this does is

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.939 
absolutely amazing what this does is
this<00:00:42.429> bypasses<00:00:43.239> your<00:00:43.359> stock<00:00:43.659> bushings<00:00:44.170> so<00:00:44.379> I'm

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
this bypasses your stock bushings so I'm

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.369 
this bypasses your stock bushings so I'm
guessing<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.339> is<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.550> toyota<00:00:46.030> design<00:00:46.379> with

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
guessing this is a toyota design with

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.829 
guessing this is a toyota design with
the<00:00:47.499> rear<00:00:47.679> differential<00:00:48.129> because<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.719> know

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
the rear differential because you know

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.629 
the rear differential because you know
subaru<00:00:50.170> always<00:00:50.379> uses<00:00:50.710> one<00:00:50.920> bolt<00:00:51.129> for<00:00:51.370> an<00:00:51.429> bolt

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
subaru always uses one bolt for an bolt

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.610 
subaru always uses one bolt for an bolt
wear<00:00:51.879> Toyota<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.809> have<00:00:52.899> got<00:00:53.049> two<00:00:53.260> bolts<00:00:53.499> on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
wear Toyota you have got two bolts on

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.289 
wear Toyota you have got two bolts on
one<00:00:53.799> side<00:00:54.010> one<00:00:54.429> bolt<00:00:54.609> on<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.850> other<00:00:54.999> for<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
one side one bolt on the other for the

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.629 
one side one bolt on the other for the
rear<00:00:55.420> dip<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:56.379> what<00:00:56.859> this<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.100> gonna<00:00:57.219> do<00:00:57.429> you're

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
rear dip so what this is gonna do you're

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.729 
rear dip so what this is gonna do you're
just<00:00:57.670> literally<00:00:58.089> gonna<00:00:58.299> take<00:00:58.539> out<00:00:58.719> your<00:00:59.530> rear

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
just literally gonna take out your rear

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.770 
just literally gonna take out your rear
diff<00:00:59.920> bolts<00:01:00.549> and<00:01:00.699> then<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.299> is<00:01:01.479> actually

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
diff bolts and then this is actually

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.119 
diff bolts and then this is actually
going<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.989> attach<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.620> rear<00:01:02.799> crossmember

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
going to attach to the rear crossmember

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.090 
going to attach to the rear crossmember
using<00:01:04.119> these<00:01:04.600> two<00:01:04.780> holes<00:01:04.989> right<00:01:05.590> here<00:01:05.920> and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
using these two holes right here and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.580 
using these two holes right here and
then<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:07.299> course<00:01:07.539> it<00:01:07.689> just<00:01:07.719> bypasses<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
then of course it just bypasses the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.560 
then of course it just bypasses the
factory<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.100> bushing<00:01:09.340> by<00:01:09.640> entering<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
factory this bushing by entering the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.730 
factory this bushing by entering the
bolts<00:01:10.840> into<00:01:10.960> there<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.439> then<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.710> course

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
bolts into there and then of course

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.660 
bolts into there and then of course
you're<00:01:12.009> just<00:01:12.159> going<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.340> tighten<00:01:12.549> them<00:01:12.640> down

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
you're just going to tighten them down

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.719 
you're just going to tighten them down
and<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.659> essentially<00:01:14.259> becomes<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.710> solid<00:01:14.979> mount

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
and it essentially becomes a solid mount

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.209 
and it essentially becomes a solid mount
which<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.060> really<00:01:16.600> really<00:01:17.049> cool<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.680> absolutely

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
which is really really cool I absolutely

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.590 
which is really really cool I absolutely
love<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:18.549> now<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:18.939> gonna<00:01:19.030> add<00:01:19.240> quite<00:01:19.539> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
love this now it is gonna add quite a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.420 
love this now it is gonna add quite a
bit<00:01:19.659> of<00:01:19.869> noise<00:01:19.960> harshest<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.619> vibration<00:01:21.250> just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
bit of noise harshest and vibration just

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.740 
bit of noise harshest and vibration just
because<00:01:22.000> you're<00:01:22.149> getting<00:01:22.390> rid<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.659> those

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
because you're getting rid of those

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.539 
because you're getting rid of those
factory<00:01:23.200> soft<00:01:23.500> bushings<00:01:24.009> you're<00:01:24.250> going<00:01:24.430> with

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
factory soft bushings you're going with

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.789 
factory soft bushings you're going with
these<00:01:24.700> hard<00:01:25.289> polyurethane<00:01:26.289> bushings<00:01:26.680> now

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
these hard polyurethane bushings now

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.990 
these hard polyurethane bushings now
it's<00:01:26.920> good<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.219> they<00:01:27.310> did<00:01:27.369> add<00:01:27.700> these

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
it's good that they did add these

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.149 
it's good that they did add these
because<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:28.869> will<00:01:29.140> help<00:01:29.500> dampen<00:01:29.740> some<00:01:30.070> of

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
because this will help dampen some of

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.310 
because this will help dampen some of
the<00:01:30.219> noise<00:01:30.399> harshest<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.030> vibration<00:01:31.539> from

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
the noise harshest and vibration from

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.830 
the noise harshest and vibration from
this<00:01:32.530> bar<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.890> from<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.100> rear<00:01:33.250> dip<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:33.939> it<00:01:34.689> is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
this bar and from the rear dip but it is

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.419 
this bar and from the rear dip but it is
going<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.140> be<00:01:35.229> more<00:01:35.500> than<00:01:35.710> Factory<00:01:36.130> which<00:01:36.310> of

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
going to be more than Factory which of

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.880 
going to be more than Factory which of
course<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.820> know<00:01:36.909> is<00:01:37.119> kind<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.859> kind<00:01:38.859> of
