00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
94,000 and the way I use this build was

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.230 
94,000 and the way I use this build was
to<00:01:18.090> charge<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.810> magic<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.770> bonus<00:01:20.340> combos<00:01:20.880> and

to charge my magic with bonus combos and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840 
to charge my magic with bonus combos and
I<00:01:21.600> showed<00:01:21.869> how<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.320> works<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.100> last<00:01:23.369> video

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
I showed how that works in my last video

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
I showed how that works in my last video
so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.360> thought<00:01:24.420> I'd<00:01:24.780> show<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.350> action<00:01:25.770> here

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so I thought I'd show it in action here

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.420 
so I thought I'd show it in action here
and<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.540> handy<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> use<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:29.100> charge

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and it's really handy to use to charge

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.990 
and it's really handy to use to charge
her<00:01:29.670> magic<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.960> had<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> level<00:01:31.680> 35<00:01:32.340> shock

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
her magic and I had a level 35 shock

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
her magic and I had a level 35 shock
magic<00:01:33.540> ring<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> rare<00:01:34.829> magic<00:01:35.280> attack

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
magic ring with the rare magic attack

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.350 
magic ring with the rare magic attack
and<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> magic<00:01:36.540> helm<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.350> gave<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:38.360> 481

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and the magic helm which gave me 481

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
and the magic helm which gave me 481
shock<00:01:39.869> which<00:01:40.710> makes<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:42.350> 700,000<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.409> over

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
shock which makes about 700,000 or over
damage<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.180> each<00:01:45.360> shot

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
damage for each shot

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.490 
damage for each shot
spell<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.190> way<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:48.270> able<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.780> cut<00:01:49.170> them

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
spell so that way I was able to cut them

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030 
spell so that way I was able to cut them
down<00:01:49.740> fast<00:01:50.570> even<00:01:51.570> though<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.200> might<00:01:52.350> notice<00:01:52.800> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
down fast even though you might notice I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.390 
down fast even though you might notice I
didn't<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.790> dark<00:01:54.090> fire<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.860> dark<00:01:56.130> fire

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
didn't have my dark fire so my dark fire

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.870 
didn't have my dark fire so my dark fire
is<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> fuse<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.619> did<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.250> merit<00:01:59.700> at

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
is in the fuse so I did have my merit at

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.170 
is in the fuse so I did have my merit at
gem<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:01.260> relying<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.400> paying<00:02:02.910> as<00:02:03.150> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
gem but I was relying on paying as a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.950 
gem but I was relying on paying as a
mage<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.900> well<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.530> normal<00:02:05.280> attack<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.090> find

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
mage as well as normal attack I find

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.260 
mage as well as normal attack I find
this<00:02:07.140> an<00:02:07.350> effective<00:02:07.890> strategy<00:02:08.270> against

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this an effective strategy against

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.220 
this an effective strategy against
bosses<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.470> fusing<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.070> dark<00:02:11.220> fire<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
bosses when I'm fusing my dark fire so I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.910 
bosses when I'm fusing my dark fire so I
used<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.400> magic<00:02:14.670> quite<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> lot<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.870> shock<00:02:16.650> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
used the magic quite a lot and shock is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.699 
used the magic quite a lot and shock is
the<00:02:17.310> highest<00:02:17.730> magic<00:02:18.180> damage<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:19.230> gives<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the highest magic damage it gives you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
the highest magic damage it gives you
one<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.190> half<00:02:20.400> times<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.480> magic<00:02:22.260> amount<00:02:23.120> so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
one and a half times the magic amount so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.140 
one and a half times the magic amount so
that's<00:02:24.420> why<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.750> would<00:02:24.900> be<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.700> 700,000<00:02:26.700> for

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that's why it would be about 700,000 for

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.350 
that's why it would be about 700,000 for
481<00:02:28.280> damage<00:02:29.280> magic<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:31.250> holy<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.820> least

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
481 damage magic and holy is the least

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.800 
481 damage magic and holy is the least
amount<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.050> damage<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:35.300> incinerate<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
amount of damage and incinerate is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.940 
amount of damage and incinerate is
higher<00:02:37.650> than<00:02:38.070> holy<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.269> shock<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
higher than holy but shock is the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.270 
higher than holy but shock is the
highest<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.980> high

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
highest and so I like to have a high

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.320 
highest and so I like to have a high
shock<00:02:44.760> ring<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:45.600> both<00:02:45.810> characters<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.330> use

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
shock ring for both characters and use

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.300 
shock ring for both characters and use
that<00:02:48.570> against<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> bosses<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.070> see

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that against the bosses and you can see

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.170 
that against the bosses and you can see
I'm<00:02:50.610> really<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:51.540> into<00:02:51.959> rollin<00:02:52.440> here<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
I'm really going into rollin here and it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.120 
I'm really going into rollin here and it
does<00:02:54.390> help<00:02:54.660> definitely<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.890> high

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
does help definitely to have that high

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.960 
does help definitely to have that high
rare<00:02:56.459> attack<00:02:56.880> as<00:02:57.120> well<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.160> sometimes<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.489> use

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
rare attack as well and sometimes I use

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.470 
rare attack as well and sometimes I use
more<00:03:00.390> Titan<00:03:01.049> rage<00:03:01.260> gems<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> mainly<00:03:03.000> go<00:03:03.209> for

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
more Titan rage gems and mainly go for

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.569 
more Titan rage gems and mainly go for
parry<00:03:03.750> breaks<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:05.010> way<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.459> can

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
parry breaks and that way I can

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.780 
parry breaks and that way I can
sometimes<00:03:06.030> cast<00:03:06.630> magic<00:03:07.019> twice<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:07.980> parry
