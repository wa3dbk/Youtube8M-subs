00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.189
 these friends or simon here saturday 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.080
 review day supplemental I am also one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 maybe it will get a bit sick 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 a bit my voice you know that 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 my card is a little better now 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 the motivation comes again motivation 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.140
 is the right keyword we are 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 through at the duster test today booster 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 Review b 4 by celle choir booster it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 Actually it is already very long 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 the completely different composition i 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.020
 I still know who the old c4 is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.930
 this dma in it that we no longer 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.840
 want to have what was also forbidden 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.640
 pretty much the old one really has 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.390
 has converted possible series 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 keep focus upright 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 Accordingly, I was careful with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.739
 the product resulting in terms of dosage 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.530
 with a stroke starting with a scoop 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.539
 56 grams are those in a script 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 get right to a bit 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 negative at 1 group I really have 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 nothing if not noticed 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.420
 then went up with the dosage 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 divider coups then you really notice 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 what I will tell you now briefly 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.259
 what's inside why you notice what we do 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 have such a classic composition here 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.939
 we have everyone in there, please 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.009
 fairly good concentration 1.5 grams 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.710
 we have big proportions here 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.369
 Be creative that entered into it very much 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 very good creatin really 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.909
 receptive creatine good creative 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.720
 the body is really shaping very much 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.490
 can absorb well 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.040
 that's why the high concentration 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.939
 otherwise there is something left in here 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.860
 adina kg knows her as I said so 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.570
 a lot more pump care is right 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 little in here I will be the same 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.860
 to respond to this effect l 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 tyrosine for more focus we have with 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.210
 oranges it drives extract in it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.369
 practically except our fabric of you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 the overall so a bit for it 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.060
 He makes sure that his metabolism 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.560
 it gets a bit better 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.479
 could train them too 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.390
 a bit more focus is here too 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 in there how to say now to the effect 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.900
 a scoop nothing at two scoops good 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.970
 Effect especially the effect of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
 I found Berlin very good here 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.980
 you know alanin just cares 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.720
 that we do not like that muscle 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.459
 quickly acidified simply said that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.069
 you can create more repetition 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.600
 that she could train better 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.220
 actually so i have more 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.450
 make repeat I could could 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.519
 really a bit harder train 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.250
 also through the creative came in here 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.540
 i really like that i really have 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.630
 a good workout 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.070
 the focus was ok i 'm fine 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.040
 felt better felt 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.230
 from the point to practically that of him 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.959
 I have not noticed much, too 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.730
 at two scoops that's why as you said 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.660
 it just has to know this is product 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.360
 not the cheapest 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 especially we have 30 service here 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.040
 her have almost as high doses 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.239
 just 15 should consider whether it is the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.510
 bring that is so my little conclusion I 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.140
 I know that many of you have the taste 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.989
 color 60 shot the taste too 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.900
 someone wants to have rated 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:26.209
 mixa taste test odor test smells 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.209
 very good super small lisa six grams 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 is great on looks good 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.049
 great finally tastes good as it 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.970
 There are many things that taste good 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.680
 that's why it's not not 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.810
 so the criterion for me in any case 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.519
 this is a buy recommendation for me 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 I can drink that too now 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.780
 nothing would not notice here for 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.250
 training today why is it for 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.379
 me a purchase recommendation I think that 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.569
 that all very well, I think that 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.760
 Taste very good and the credit rating 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.340
 for me so super super fabrics in there 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.060
 which I think is good because of that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.319
 the whole thing with the iron pump 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.549
 combined because you know that I was from 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.400
 really liked the product 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.190
 especially from this focus and de 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.590
 madrid from which all mini entered which 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.180
 just here is not in it and have 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.859
 we just do not have weather for that 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.799
 Just give it as a tip if you have it 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.630
 you want to try out the product 50 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.800
 minutes of the workout as I said 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.840
 own nitrate needs a bit 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.539
 It will take longer for you to see it 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.180
 other video times to the review to the 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:36.039
 Product 50 minutes before training 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.380
 taken 1q of it 20 minutes before 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.460
 I have one and a half scoops training 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.830
 So I tried around a bit 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.570
 tested it was amazing 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.330
 I really have to tell you it was one 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.370
 Citizen that was really awesome madness 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.830
 point madness a very very strong 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.740
 nice focus i just think by 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.539
 the substances that are so through 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.979
 have pushed a bit up which little 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.120
 Caffeine also has a bit of caffeine 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.770
 in it 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.479
 insane workout as everyone has said 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.610
 it's no need to know for yourself 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.099
 who can be so motivated so good 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.439
 training can actually be enough 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.120
 I just want to experience something new 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.629
 can you really this combination very much 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.719
 recommend 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.279
 It was really good, but really good 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.779
 I'll be fun too if I am 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.069
 I'm fit again when I'm healthy 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:22.969
 I am doing exactly as I am 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.870
 all my stuff here too that is so 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.349
 my conclusion 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.620
 That's why I'm the sole product 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:33.080
 There is no clear purchase recommendation 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.150
 better if you put on a product 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.909
 volt through the composition of the 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.189
 nutrients through the by yes 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.439
 The ingredients are very suitable 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.719
 very good as a combi product because we too 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.949
 have no creatine in it 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.509
 taken together , it takes longer 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.900
 outside is not quite as high a dose 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.669
 absolute tip from me as I said 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.460
 Taken together super super super good 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.229
 Great workout and we are there 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.210
 next time subscribe to the channel looks 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.900

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.900
