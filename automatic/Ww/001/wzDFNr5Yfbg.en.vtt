00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a tattoo it has to be something

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
a tattoo it has to be something
meaningful<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.820> guess<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.600> about

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
meaningful I guess when you think about

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
meaningful I guess when you think about
it<00:00:42.809> meaningful<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.460> lot<00:00:44.760> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it meaningful can be for a lot of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
it meaningful can be for a lot of
different<00:00:44.879> reasons<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.780> guess<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.289> tattoos

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
different reasons I guess some tattoos

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
different reasons I guess some tattoos
might<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.129> meaningful<00:00:47.670> because

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
might be really meaningful because

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
might be really meaningful because
there's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.420> interesting<00:00:48.750> story

that it's really nice to see people's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
tattoos I think that's something really

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.850 
tattoos I think that's something really
interesting<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.799> some

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
interesting because I know there's some

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
interesting because I know there's some
people<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.340> who<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.939> tattoos<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
people out there who do get tattoos that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
people out there who do get tattoos that
might<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:21.960> particularly<00:01:22.650> meaningful<00:01:22.979> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
might not be particularly meaningful but

skin<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.769> suppose<00:02:49.099> personally<00:02:49.849> for<00:02:49.879> me<00:02:50.060> I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
skin I suppose personally for me I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.610 
skin I suppose personally for me I
really<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.750> tattoos<00:02:51.139> whether<00:02:51.439> or<00:02:51.560> not

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
really like tattoos whether or not

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.470 
really like tattoos whether or not
they're<00:02:51.829> on<00:02:51.919> guys<00:02:52.129> or<00:02:52.159> girls<00:02:52.700> obviously<00:02:53.450> I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
they're on guys or girls obviously I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.270 
they're on guys or girls obviously I
don't<00:02:53.629> like<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.230> tattoos<00:02:54.620> because<00:02:54.859> there's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
don't like all tattoos because there's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.979 
don't like all tattoos because there's
some<00:02:55.459> tattoos<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.329> look<00:02:56.689> a<00:02:56.810> bit<00:02:56.959> silly

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
some tattoos that just look a bit silly

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.199 
some tattoos that just look a bit silly
in<00:02:57.500> my<00:02:57.739> opinion<00:02:58.099> although<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.000> appreciate

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
in my opinion although I can appreciate

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.059 
in my opinion although I can appreciate
why<00:02:59.510> some<00:02:59.989> people<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:00.349> that<00:03:00.470> tattoos<00:03:00.919> are

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
why some people think that tattoos are

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.159 
why some people think that tattoos are
not<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.340> good<00:03:01.579> idea<00:03:01.609> i'm<00:03:02.030> definitely<00:03:02.659> not<00:03:02.840> one

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
not a good idea i'm definitely not one

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.509 
not a good idea i'm definitely not one
of<00:03:03.200> those<00:03:03.319> people<00:03:03.769> who<00:03:03.980> thinks<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.370> you

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
of those people who thinks that you

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.250 
of those people who thinks that you
should<00:03:04.549> never<00:03:04.819> get<00:03:05.090> one<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.840> i<00:03:05.900> guess<00:03:06.049> at<00:03:06.169> this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
should never get one so i guess at this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.599 
should never get one so i guess at this
point<00:03:06.349> i'd<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:07.040> share<00:03:07.220> with<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.430> guys<00:03:07.459> my

ago when i was a teenager i bought this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.649 
ago when i was a teenager i bought this
pendant<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.189> it<00:03:16.519> was<00:03:16.609> a<00:03:16.639> Tibetan<00:03:17.150> symbol<00:03:17.540> and

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
pendant and it was a Tibetan symbol and

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.539 
pendant and it was a Tibetan symbol and
I<00:03:17.750> really<00:03:18.049> liked<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:19.040> was<00:03:19.190> war<00:03:19.400> that

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
I really liked it and I was war that

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.159 
I really liked it and I was war that
pendant<00:03:20.090> having<00:03:20.419> a<00:03:20.449> tattoo<00:03:20.599> was<00:03:20.840> always<00:03:21.049> at

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
pendant having a tattoo was always at

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.509 
pendant having a tattoo was always at
the<00:03:21.229> back<00:03:21.349> of<00:03:21.530> my<00:03:21.560> mind<00:03:21.799> but<00:03:21.979> I<00:03:22.099> never<00:03:22.250> really

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
the back of my mind but I never really

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.460 
the back of my mind but I never really
knew<00:03:22.699> what<00:03:22.849> I<00:03:22.909> wanted<00:03:23.299> exactly<00:03:23.479> but<00:03:24.049> I<00:03:24.260> always

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
knew what I wanted exactly but I always

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.990 
knew what I wanted exactly but I always
thought<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:24.859> I<00:03:25.069> was<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.459> get<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.609> tattoo<00:03:25.790> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
thought that if I was to get a tattoo it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.969 
thought that if I was to get a tattoo it
would<00:03:26.090> probably<00:03:26.329> be<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:26.810> Tibetan<00:03:27.199> symbol<00:03:27.590> so

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
would probably be that Tibetan symbol so

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.409 
would probably be that Tibetan symbol so
it<00:03:28.099> actually<00:03:28.220> happened<00:03:28.669> was<00:03:28.699> one<00:03:29.060> day<00:03:29.090> when<00:03:29.389> I

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
it actually happened was one day when I

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.490 
it actually happened was one day when I
was<00:03:29.479> hanging<00:03:29.900> out<00:03:29.959> with<00:03:30.019> one<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.379> my<00:03:30.470> friends

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500

was<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> little<00:04:11.359> bit<00:04:11.599> I<00:04:11.750> guess<00:04:11.930> awkward<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:12.769> it

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
was a little bit I guess awkward but it

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.860 
was a little bit I guess awkward but it
was<00:04:13.009> an<00:04:13.099> experience<00:04:13.699> I<00:04:13.970> suppose<00:04:14.299> my<00:04:14.629> first

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
was an experience I suppose my first

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.509 
was an experience I suppose my first
tattoo<00:04:15.169> actually<00:04:15.470> didn't<00:04:16.099> hurt<00:04:16.280> all<00:04:16.489> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
tattoo actually didn't hurt all that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.729 
tattoo actually didn't hurt all that
much<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:17.090> I'm<00:04:17.239> clearly<00:04:17.840> honest<00:04:18.229> my<00:04:18.470> first

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
much like I'm clearly honest my first

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.229 
much like I'm clearly honest my first
one<00:04:18.889> didn't<00:04:19.070> hurt<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.789> the<00:04:19.849> reason<00:04:20.000> why

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
one didn't hurt I think the reason why

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.670 
one didn't hurt I think the reason why
is<00:04:20.299> because<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.989> place<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.380> got<00:04:21.560> it

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
is because the place that I got it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.100 
is because the place that I got it
wasn't<00:04:21.979> all<00:04:22.099> that<00:04:22.130> sensitive<00:04:22.760> but<00:04:23.270> my<00:04:23.779> second

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
wasn't all that sensitive but my second

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.510 
wasn't all that sensitive but my second
one<00:04:24.229> really<00:04:24.830> hurt

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
one really hurt

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.300 
one really hurt

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.820 
consideration that i had when i got it
done<00:04:59.270> was<00:04:59.509> that<00:04:59.720> in<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.139> future<00:05:00.289> i<00:05:00.650> was

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
done was that in the future i was

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.379 
done was that in the future i was
probably<00:05:01.069> going<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.699> be<00:05:01.819> a<00:05:01.849> lawyer<00:05:02.090> so

obviously i can't like get a tattoo that
would<00:05:04.699> be<00:05:04.849> visible<00:05:05.150> if<00:05:05.599> i<00:05:05.750> wore<00:05:06.050> like<00:05:06.650> a

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
would be visible if i wore like a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.409 
would be visible if i wore like a
three-quarter<00:05:07.370> blouse<00:05:07.729> or<00:05:08.030> something<00:05:08.330> like
