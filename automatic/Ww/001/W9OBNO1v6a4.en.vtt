not<00:03:55.659> much<00:03:55.900> though<00:03:56.169> I<00:03:56.409> like<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.769> taste<00:03:56.979> of<00:03:57.129> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
not much though I like the taste of the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.890 
not much though I like the taste of the
buck<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.489> really<00:03:57.909> helps<00:03:58.209> kind<00:03:58.359> of<00:03:58.479> round<00:03:58.720> it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
buck that really helps kind of round it

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.140

out<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.560> guess<00:03:59.829> on<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> scale<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.430> 1<00:04:00.699> to<00:04:00.729> 5<00:04:01.090> and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
out so I guess on a scale of 1 to 5 and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.009 
out so I guess on a scale of 1 to 5 and
I<00:04:01.720> don't<00:04:02.139> feel<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.379> specifying<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.310> 1<00:04:04.120> or<00:04:04.540> R<00:04:04.689> 5

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
I don't feel like specifying if 1 or R 5

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.960 
I don't feel like specifying if 1 or R 5
means<00:04:05.470> good<00:04:05.769> I'd<00:04:06.250> give<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.699> a<00:04:06.909> 4
