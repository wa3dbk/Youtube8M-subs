00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.960 
to each of the pyramids in only a few
months<00:02:24.359> of<00:02:24.659> excavation<00:02:25.409> plenty<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.400> stonework

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
months of excavation plenty of stonework

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.699 
months of excavation plenty of stonework
has<00:02:27.299> already<00:02:27.720> been<00:02:27.900> discovered

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
has already been discovered

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.240 
has already been discovered
so<00:02:28.980> obviously<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.480> Mother<00:02:30.750> Nature<00:02:30.900> does<00:02:31.859> not

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so obviously the Mother Nature does not

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.479 
so obviously the Mother Nature does not
do<00:02:32.760> things<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:36.200> also<00:02:37.200> found<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.920> network

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
do things like this also found a network

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.629 
do things like this also found a network
of<00:02:38.849> tunnels<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.629> may<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.889> lead<00:02:41.189> the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
of tunnels that may very well lead the

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.990 
of tunnels that may very well lead the
pyramids<00:02:45.530> most<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.859> tunnels<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.609> narrow

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
pyramids most of the tunnels are narrow

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.129 
pyramids most of the tunnels are narrow
and<00:02:48.359> cramped<00:02:52.819> like<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:54.150> tunnel<00:02:54.599> where<00:02:54.989> we

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
and cramped like this tunnel where we

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.409 
and cramped like this tunnel where we
walked<00:02:55.439> and<00:02:55.680> crawled<00:02:55.919> for<00:02:56.430> nearly<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.790> third<00:02:57.180> of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
a mile along this main channel 1000 plus

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.710 
a mile along this main channel 1000 plus

feet are a series of intersections and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.390 
feet are a series of intersections and
amazingly<00:03:04.379> they<00:03:04.650> lead<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.040> even<00:03:05.370> more
