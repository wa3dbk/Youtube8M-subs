00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 besides the wholesomeness of this type of food 'its creators were also 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.470
 concerned about the beauty of the meadows as each meal had to be preceded by 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.370
 a period of contemplation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 the success of the Japanese race around the world is caused by several factors 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.280
 and that without nutrients have low calorie counts 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.410

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.600
 are excellent for fighting fatigue so do not get sleepy after 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 a meal in Japanese fashion 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.980
 the sushi originates from an ancient method of preserving fish accused in the southeast 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:08.720
 Asian 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 the clean and open fish were packaged with wet raw rice and the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 allow rice sales are or fish preventing its decomposition 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 this technique is believed to have arrived in Japan around the 8th century 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.160
 but only the fishmonger eaten USA was discarded 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.200
 this bothered the Japanese in its version to waste 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.100
 that method was also very slow 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 the preserved fish was only ready after a period of about one year and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.350
 two months, these factors led to the residents of Tokyo who were 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.259
 prosperous metropolitan and cabral parakeet captain to look for ways to 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 in 1826 that opened its first kiosk said today in Tokyo in the Jewish quarter 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.340
 little soon followed by others 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 In this first phase of commercial fighters, sushi has acquired the form that it has until 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 practically unchanged today 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 very strict criteria in the choice of ingredients always inhibit the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.439
 practitioners of trying innovations 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.009
