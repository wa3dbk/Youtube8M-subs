you do one of the most common ways that
people<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:38.239> heat<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.600> whole

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
people do it is they heat the whole

people do it is they heat the whole
fermenter<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> couple<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> degrees<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
fermenter up a couple of degrees and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.590 
fermenter up a couple of degrees and
give<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> bit<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> slow<00:00:42.989> stir<00:00:44.300> just<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> get

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
give it a bit of a slow stir just to get

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
give it a bit of a slow stir just to get
the<00:00:45.690> yeast<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> active<00:00:49.129> there's<00:00:50.129> no

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the yeast up again and active there's no

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
the yeast up again and active there's no
rule<00:00:50.579> need<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> brew<00:00:54.570> might

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
rule need to do that and you brew might

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.810 
rule need to do that and you brew might
benefit<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.640> you're<00:00:56.730> going

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
benefit for that and then you're going

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.920 
benefit for that and then you're going
to<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> wait<00:00:57.270> another<00:00:57.480> couple<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> days

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

quarter of a gram your yeast to about

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.190 
quarter of a gram your yeast to about
five<00:01:43.920> hundred<00:01:44.130> mils<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.869> give<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> good

five hundred mils you give it a good

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
five hundred mils you give it a good
shake<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> lid<00:01:48.360> on

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
warm it's going to cure yeast and you'll

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.330 
warm it's going to cure yeast and you'll
leave<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.440> there<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.800> 24<00:02:18.250> hours<00:02:20.099> after<00:02:21.099> that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
yeast has got back to work then you know

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.509 
yeast has got back to work then you know
that<00:02:42.989> adding<00:02:43.989> more<00:02:44.019> yeast<00:02:44.410> or<00:02:44.769> another<00:02:45.099> packet

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
which you might have to do to your

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.070 
which you might have to do to your
fermenter<00:02:49.830> will<00:02:50.830> get<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.099> going<00:02:51.370> again<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.900> it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
fermenter will get it going again if it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.339 
fermenter will get it going again if it
hasn't<00:02:53.230> moved<00:02:53.530> again<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.970> same

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
hasn't moved again and it's the same

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.600 
hasn't moved again and it's the same
then<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> buy<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.920> made<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> proper

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
then you know you buy the made a proper

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.809 
then you know you buy the made a proper
mistake<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.420> you're<00:02:58.540> brewing<00:02:58.720> practices<00:02:59.819> or

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
mistake and you're brewing practices or

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.160 
mistake and you're brewing practices or
it's<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.810> not<00:03:02.019> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> get<00:03:02.410> any<00:03:02.620> lower

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
it's just not going to get any lower
