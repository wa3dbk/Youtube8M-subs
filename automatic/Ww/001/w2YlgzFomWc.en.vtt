contract again so yeah last time I did

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.279 
contract again so yeah last time I did
the<00:00:19.100> thing<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.369> got<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.900> factory<00:00:21.900> new<00:00:22.050> block

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the thing and I got a factory new block

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.269 
the thing and I got a factory new block
paid<00:00:23.029> which<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> insane<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.130> that's<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
paid which is insane and that's the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.410 
paid which is insane and that's the
worth<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.880> 40<00:00:27.330> pounds<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> cost<00:00:29.849> me<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
worth like 40 pounds this cost me I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.889 
worth like 40 pounds this cost me I
think<00:00:30.840> six<00:00:31.080> pounds<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.149> is<00:00:33.149> quite<00:00:33.510> high

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
think six pounds this is quite high

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
think six pounds this is quite high
because<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.559> people<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.460> want

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
because that people know that you want

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
because that people know that you want
to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
to get it to get that they know that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.110 
to get it to get that they know that
you're<00:00:37.950> gonna<00:00:38.129> pay<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.520> amount<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:39.000> why

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you're gonna pay that amount that's why

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.310 
you're gonna pay that amount that's why
it's<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.329> valuable<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.989> such<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.770> skin

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
it's so valuable for such as skin

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.920 
it's so valuable for such as skin
so<00:00:43.320> let's<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:44.090> find<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.390> trade<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.260> contract

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
so let's go find the trade up contract

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.799 
so let's go find the trade up contract
last<00:00:48.930> time<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.200> used<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.280> there's<00:00:50.809> sg553

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
last time we used I think there's sg553

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.670 
last time we used I think there's sg553
's<00:00:53.270> see<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.780> find<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> hot<00:00:55.410> rod

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
's see if we can just find the hot rod

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
's see if we can just find the hot rod
there<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> put<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.289> need

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there is put that one in and now we need

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.939

nine<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> other<00:01:00.140> type<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.590> think

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
nine of the other type I think I think

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.560 
nine of the other type I think I think
it's<00:01:02.129> any<00:01:02.370> type<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.090> sure<00:01:03.329> okay<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> you

collection I'm gonna put nine of them in

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
collection I'm gonna put nine of them in
and<00:01:11.790> let's<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and let's see what I get back so this is

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.640 
and let's see what I get back so this is
the<00:01:16.500> Brava<00:01:16.830> collection<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> bind<00:01:17.850> with

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the Brava collection you can bind with

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.480 
the Brava collection you can bind with
the<00:01:21.080> process<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> assault<00:01:22.710> collection<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the process the assault collection the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
the process the assault collection the
Olcott<00:01:23.909> rod<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.720> below<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.049> Glock

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
Olcott rod which is one below the Glock

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.670 
Olcott rod which is one below the Glock
fade<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.670> mp9<00:01:26.970> bulldozer<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
fade and the mp9 bulldozer so I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.670 
fade and the mp9 bulldozer so I
understand<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> chance<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> getting<00:01:30.680> either

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
understand the chance of getting either

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830 
understand the chance of getting either
one<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> those<00:01:32.189> two<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.729> fingers<00:01:33.630> crossed

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
one of those two so fingers crossed

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.940 
one of those two so fingers crossed
hopefully<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.740> works<00:01:36.470> if<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:37.740> work

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hopefully this works if it does work

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
hopefully this works if it does work
then<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:39.000> we've<00:01:39.180> figured<00:01:39.630> out

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
then I pretty sure we've figured out

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
then I pretty sure we've figured out
like<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.380> method<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.549> getting<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:42.540> fade

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
like a method to getting got fade

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.179 
like a method to getting got fade
consistently<00:01:44.360> know<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.170> random<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
consistently know so it's random is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.920 
consistently know so it's random is
random<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> complete<00:01:48.630> waste<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
random so that was a complete waste of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.960 
random so that was a complete waste of
money<00:01:50.450> damn<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.920> thought<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> had<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.549> thought

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
money damn I thought I had it I thought

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.639 
money damn I thought I had it I thought
I<00:01:54.030> had<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> locked<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.250> sure<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I had it locked I was like so sure so it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
I had it locked I was like so sure so it
is<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.159> chance<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.850> getting<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.390> got<00:02:00.570> fade

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
is just a chance of getting it got fade

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.530 
is just a chance of getting it got fade
but<00:02:01.290> maybe<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> did<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.880> lucky<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.360> my

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
but maybe I did get really lucky in my

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.230 
but maybe I did get really lucky in my
video<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:05.840> Wow

the braava case I had an insert and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.430 
the braava case I had an insert and
chance<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.910> leveling<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.200> just

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
chance of leveling this one up so I just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.900 
chance of leveling this one up so I just
got<00:02:15.560> lucky<00:02:15.710> really<00:02:16.210> nothing<00:02:17.210> more<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> say<00:02:17.720> we
