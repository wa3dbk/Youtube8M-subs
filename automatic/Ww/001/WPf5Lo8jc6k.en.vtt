 pure variety and we will become me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.130
 think the most on this mini 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.239
 games concentrate what's up there ? 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 we have what we are seeing right now 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.520
 a game play off commented because i 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 really now because I am 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 must concentrate and really so much 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 information as possible out now but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.950
 That's just four minutes 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 or was one way or the other 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.140
 Of course, games are clear like me, by the way 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.690
 gameplay is on the server and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.300
 mobile games ender games dragon escape 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 special what is there so many mini 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 I will also try new ones 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 and of course you are in demand 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.540
 you are welcome in the comments 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.760
 what you like to write for 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 mini games would like to see that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.510
 I would be interested in any case 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.970
 I'll take a look and I will 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.900
 think there also implement or play 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 if I enjoy it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 Likewise, the whole thing does not want to be alone 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.070
 make or all the time 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 alone, of course, with some partners 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 not alone 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 but at least once I want one 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 week when it is time to me 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 grab another youtuber and join 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 give up a round together no matter if 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.390
 sits like game center is gamestreamer 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.220
 and then we will have fun together 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 that's the project and that will be 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 whole then daily at I have the clock 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.210
 pocket again I believe it 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.470
 was 17 o'clock yes every day at 17 o'clock vista 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 minecraft does not give a schedule yet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.710
 Upload 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 then I will see when microsoft 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 more complicated I have it was 17 daily 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.790
 Minecraft are just a funny round 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 and that looks very interesting 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.850
 the question is of course now some 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.229
 people have minecraft different again 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.290
 it is a singleplayer etc 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.140
 he was really cool 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.180
 but makes the worker is single player 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 very interesting is 30 40 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.420
 You can do it but afterwards 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.649
 it goes back to me boring 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.330
 Of course someone knows you correctly 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.770
 cool j 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.570
 which is really awesome and where 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.130
 I could take a look then I could 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.990
 the whole time just so from time to time 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.700
 singleplayer moderately heinrich is no 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.200
 The thing is daily just sitting around 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 minecraft did not have it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.630
 it must have always survival game ever 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.610
 this or that 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.000
 of course we can look at what 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 other purely facts such as singleplayer 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.720
 moderately novel latest what pack in 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 the kind of exit that's still there 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.900
 no idea but there is something like that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.670
 many what's next the fed interesting 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.780
 Of course, the hottest when I'm there 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.640
 would find someone to work with 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.140
 can take me or 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 another youtuber the problem with 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.840
 this other youtube there are some 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.090
 Candidates with whom I like that too 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.950
 it would not be so, but it is 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.400
 but very blatant always an appointment too 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.070
 Find 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.570
 mostly the person are also in the 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.770
 week 40 hours working 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.450
 we usually do not find one 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.890
 time then you would have fixed date 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.540
 at the weekend do where you for the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.400
 whole week open and / or 1 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.280
 2 let's look maybe 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.560
 Can you even find that? 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.480
 that we will then be singleplayer macy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.550
 Let's play together with you 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.080
 many parks but I think so 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.220
 trend in minecraft more goes to 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.680
 this mini games where you a little bit 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.209
 romrods between sends and the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.980
 all people for enjoyable flies 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.610
 just traveling and then have 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.070
 but look 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.360
 I think that will apply to everyone 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.360
 case an exciting project me 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.040
 I hope you enjoy it very much 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.269
 he gets a lot of minecraft videos 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 yes I like to look my strong 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.680
 also likes to play but I'm just 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.600
 not the oberbank ag I win there 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 see you explain the gold mining in it 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.500
 I have a real hit so 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.880
 So right now I'm getting out of it so slowly 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.440
 So better have my little 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.090
 tactics are running around 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.290
 why run around the colleague and through 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.269
 and as soon as possible the buttons 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.560
 spam and knock on it 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.380
 i've seen me two three times 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.660
 A better sword tarbs a gold 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.830
 apple in it 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.690
 of course a little fall with it 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.710
 but we get that 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.040
 actually pretty good of me I have to 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.060
 say 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.100
 and there I am again 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.870
 actually even shoulder-knocker 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.980
 deserves the gameplay is at the same time too 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 already to the end because we will someday 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.870
 really cool how the hell dying 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.330
 are commented on minecraft videos 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.530
 the interesting or live or me 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.780
 could also scan the fei again soon 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.040
 Introduce all opinion in the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.380
 comments would be really happy 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.840
 also whether we should go through this 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.330
 1 to 500,000 or if I'm the whole 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.700
 always adapt title moderately as to 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 for example lars klacks quite a lot of bachelor 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.020
 games or force two but half 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.860
 through munich because only in find 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.300
 I'm not so bad then 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.770
 people are already seeing so much now 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.400
 Minecraft made then I have to go 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.870
 subscribe to the tailgate in any case 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.820
 I often accompanied him though 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.620
 I'm sure not much ap now 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.710
 but that was a little round of 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.420
 minecraft survival games and the new one 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.070
 project if you like it opinions 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.300
 Everything in the comments I would criticize 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.340
 I'm glad I'm there I leave 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.140
 Thank you for watching prohibited 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.250
