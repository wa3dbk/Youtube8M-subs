then to evacuate water the way of siphon

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
then to evacuate water the way of siphon
works<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.009> full<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> air<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.610> now

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
works there it's full of air right now

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.280 
works there it's full of air right now
it's<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
it's not

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
real simply is to put a garden hose up

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.570 
real simply is to put a garden hose up
against<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.420> inlet<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.750> one<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.580> elbows

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
against the inlet of one of the elbows

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.790 
against the inlet of one of the elbows
this<00:01:50.420> piece<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.840> pipe<00:01:50.990> here<00:01:51.230> in<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.410> case<00:01:51.620> you

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
this piece of pipe here in this case you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.770 
this piece of pipe here in this case you
would<00:01:51.920> flow<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.520> water<00:01:52.610> through<00:01:52.940> here<00:01:53.240> down

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
would flow the water through here down

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.540 
would flow the water through here down
low<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.320> will<00:01:54.440> evacuate<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.160> air<00:01:55.310> out<00:01:55.520> of

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
low and it will evacuate the air out of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.890 
low and it will evacuate the air out of
here<00:01:55.760> you'll<00:01:55.940> see<00:01:56.090> bubbles<00:01:56.390> coming<00:01:56.450> out<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
here you'll see bubbles coming out the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.990 
here you'll see bubbles coming out the
other<00:01:57.020> side<00:01:57.260> they<00:01:58.070> should<00:01:58.250> quit<00:01:58.610> going<00:01:58.820> away

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
other side they should quit going away

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.030 
other side they should quit going away
and<00:01:59.150> just<00:01:59.210> be<00:01:59.330> flowing<00:01:59.720> water<00:01:59.900> real<00:02:00.110> good<00:02:00.320> and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and just be flowing water real good and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.640 
and just be flowing water real good and
then<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.370> can<00:02:01.460> stop<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.270> as<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.440> pump

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
then you can stop that and as you pump

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.380 
then you can stop that and as you pump
water<00:02:03.830> out<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.190> one<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.430> tanks<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.240> other

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
water out of one of the tanks the other

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.600 
water out of one of the tanks the other
tank<00:02:05.690> will<00:02:05.960> transfer<00:02:06.620> water<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.220> via<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
tank will transfer water to it via the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.820 
tank will transfer water to it via the
bridge<00:02:07.790> siphon<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:09.110> will<00:02:09.350> be<00:02:09.500> obvious

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
bridge siphon and that will be obvious

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.110 
bridge siphon and that will be obvious
you<00:02:09.860> should<00:02:09.979> see<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> water<00:02:10.550> going<00:02:10.759> down<00:02:10.850> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
you should see the water going down in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.370 
you should see the water going down in
this<00:02:11.240> tank<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.630> you're<00:02:11.750> pumping<00:02:12.050> out<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.200> this

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
this tank if you're pumping out of this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.620 
this tank if you're pumping out of this
