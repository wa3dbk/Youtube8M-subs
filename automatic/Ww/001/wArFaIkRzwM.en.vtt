use<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.730> texture<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:40.350> press<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
use this to texture it so just press the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.440 
use this to texture it so just press the
sand<00:02:40.980> paper<00:02:41.220> against<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.820> cookie<00:02:42.180> quite

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
sand paper against the cookie quite

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.590 
sand paper against the cookie quite
firmly<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:44.549> using<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.030> rough<00:02:45.239> sandpaper

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and then for even more texture I'm going

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.570 
and then for even more texture I'm going

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
orange and yellow together and then you

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.479 
orange and yellow together and then you
want<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> start<00:03:39.470> shading<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.130> cookie

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
want to start shading the cookie

want to start shading the cookie
remember<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.209> keep<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.780> darker<00:03:42.230> colors<00:03:42.590> on

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
remember to keep the darker colors on

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.190 
remember to keep the darker colors on
the<00:03:42.980> edge<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.640> then<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.269> lighter<00:03:44.600> colors<00:03:45.019> in

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
the edge and then the lighter colors in

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.940 
the edge and then the lighter colors in
the<00:03:45.290> middle<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:46.640> recommend<00:03:47.510> using<00:03:47.810> more<00:03:48.290> yellow

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
the middle I recommend using more yellow

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.009 
the middle I recommend using more yellow
chalk<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.700> middle<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.209> more<00:03:50.420> orange

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
chalk in the middle and more orange

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.560 
chalk in the middle and more orange
chalk<00:03:51.350> at<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.860> edges<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.239> makes<00:03:53.450> it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
chalk at the edges this just makes it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.440 
chalk at the edges this just makes it
look<00:03:53.720> more<00:03:53.959> realistic<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:57.880> then<00:03:58.880> if<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.239> want

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
look more realistic and then if you want

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.900 
look more realistic and then if you want
you<00:03:59.570> can<00:03:59.840> retexture<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:07.610> finish

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you can retexture it to finish

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.880 
you can retexture it to finish
everything<00:04:08.239> off<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.989> put<00:04:09.019> an<00:04:09.260> eye<00:04:09.470> pin<00:04:09.709> in

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
everything off you can put an eye pin in

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.560 
everything off you can put an eye pin in
on<00:04:10.160> what<00:04:10.730> I'm<00:04:10.850> doing<00:04:11.120> here<00:04:11.269> is<00:04:11.329> I'm<00:04:11.420> just

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
putting on some TLS to make it stick and

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.490 
putting on some TLS to make it stick and
then<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.299> want<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.540> find<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.930> good<00:04:18.109> spot

then you just want to find a good spot
and<00:04:18.769> then<00:04:18.979> just<00:04:19.220> stick<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.669> in

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420
