00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
just do cue points I've done the pretty
much<00:01:04.080> mirrored<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> same<00:01:05.010> effect<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
much mirrored the same effect on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.660 
much mirrored the same effect on the
other<00:01:05.640> side<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:07.290> second<00:01:07.680> table<00:01:07.799> as

actually pretty good for effects already
but<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> figured<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.409> trying<00:01:16.650> maps<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.070> stuff

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
but a touch phaser echo Doppler got a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.080 
but a touch phaser echo Doppler got a
backspin<00:04:42.340> -<00:04:44.490> deep<00:04:45.490> break<00:04:47.970> hmm

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
backspin - deep break hmm

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.670 
backspin - deep break hmm
you<00:04:49.750> also<00:04:49.900> got<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.110> flip<00:04:50.350> in<00:04:50.470> Dublin<00:04:55.500> yeah<00:04:56.500> those

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
you also got a flip in Dublin yeah those

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.170 
you also got a flip in Dublin yeah those
are<00:04:56.860> all<00:04:56.889> effects<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.490> are<00:04:57.639> set<00:04:57.820> up<00:04:57.910> on<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
are all effects that are set up on the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.260 
are all effects that are set up on the
keys<00:04:58.419> it's<00:04:59.050> pretty<00:04:59.290> simple<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.820> uh<00:05:00.820> followed

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
keys it's pretty simple just uh followed

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.210 
keys it's pretty simple just uh followed
by<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:02.110> map<00:05:02.260> thing<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.500> used<00:05:02.710> on<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.130> it

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
by the map thing I used on it and it

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.310 
by the map thing I used on it and it
should<00:05:03.400> work<00:05:03.639> out<00:05:03.880> fine<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.389> if<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.229> have

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
should work out fine for you if you have

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.659 
should work out fine for you if you have
any<00:05:05.470> other<00:05:05.590> questions<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.039> can<00:05:06.250> ask<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.580> the

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
any other questions you can ask on the

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.640 
any other questions you can ask on the
video<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.510> was<00:05:07.810> mostly<00:05:08.050> doing<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.380> just<00:05:08.590> a

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
track where I'm about see again samples

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.110 
track where I'm about see again samples
up<00:05:10.990> here<00:05:11.200> all<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:12.010> volumes<00:05:12.370> for<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.700> samples

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
up here all the volumes for the samples

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.140 
up here all the volumes for the samples
are<00:05:13.479> set<00:05:13.720> up<00:05:13.780> here<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:15.039> this<00:05:15.340> just<00:05:15.820> set<00:05:16.000> up

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
are set up here I have this just set up

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.610 
are set up here I have this just set up
as<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.169> random<00:05:17.710> sampler<00:05:18.900> it's<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.110> first<00:05:20.350> kit

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
as a random sampler it's the first kit

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.670 
as a random sampler it's the first kit
so<00:05:21.100> just<00:05:21.340> kind<00:05:21.729> of<00:05:22.289> contorts<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.530> then<00:05:23.620> you

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
so just kind of contorts it and then you

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.080 
so just kind of contorts it and then you
got<00:05:23.740> all<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.979> flippin<00:05:24.280> double<00:05:24.580> this<00:05:24.700> is<00:05:24.880> for

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
got all the flippin double this is for

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.790 
got all the flippin double this is for
the<00:05:25.539> post<00:05:25.750> up<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.080> either<00:05:26.289> side<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.590> deck<00:05:26.770> I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
the post up to either side of the deck I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.770 
the post up to either side of the deck I
actually<00:05:27.039> put<00:05:27.340> deck<00:05:27.520> one<00:05:27.729> or<00:05:28.180> deck<00:05:28.539> two<00:05:28.720> in

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
actually put deck one or deck two in

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.360 
actually put deck one or deck two in
front<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.169> or<00:05:29.320> deck<00:05:29.740> left<00:05:30.039> or<00:05:30.220> right

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
front of it or deck left or right

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520 
front of it or deck left or right
depending<00:05:30.550> on<00:05:30.850> your<00:05:30.970> you're<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.840> product<00:05:32.289> oh

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
so I have these set up volumes up top

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.980 
so I have these set up volumes up top
haven't<00:05:36.310> done<00:05:36.400> much<00:05:36.520> with<00:05:36.580> those<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:37.120> what<00:05:37.960> I

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
haven't done much with those and what I

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.140 
haven't done much with those and what I
plan<00:05:38.260> to<00:05:38.289> do<00:05:38.500> is<00:05:38.650> once<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:38.979> can<00:05:39.130> add<00:05:39.639> effects<00:05:40.000> on

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
plan to do is once I can add effects on

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.279 
plan to do is once I can add effects on
here<00:05:40.330> which<00:05:40.479> I'm<00:05:40.600> still<00:05:40.750> having<00:05:40.930> trouble<00:05:40.990> with

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
here which I'm still having trouble with

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.560 
here which I'm still having trouble with
they<00:05:42.280> don't<00:05:42.370> want<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:42.639> pick<00:05:42.789> up<00:05:42.910> effects<00:05:43.240> and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
they don't want to pick up effects and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.629 
they don't want to pick up effects and
activate<00:05:44.229> them<00:05:44.410> if<00:05:44.979> I<00:05:45.070> can<00:05:45.280> learn<00:05:45.490> how<00:05:45.610> to

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
activate them if I can learn how to

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.580 
activate them if I can learn how to
activate<00:05:45.940> effects<00:05:46.360> on<00:05:46.570> these<00:05:46.870> buttons<00:05:47.110> I'm

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
activate effects on these buttons I'm

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.550 
activate effects on these buttons I'm
assuming<00:05:48.010> I'll<00:05:48.100> put<00:05:48.310> maybe<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:49.229> defects<00:05:50.229> up<00:05:50.380> top

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
assuming I'll put maybe a defects up top

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.050 
assuming I'll put maybe a defects up top
here<00:05:50.770> maybe<00:05:51.070> some<00:05:51.280> Flanders<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:51.850> a<00:05:51.880> couple

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
here maybe some Flanders and a couple

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.420 
here maybe some Flanders and a couple
other<00:05:52.210> things<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:52.770> don't<00:05:53.770> really<00:05:53.889> like<00:05:54.160> using

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.320 
my Novation so uh sure you guys mapping
one<00:06:04.450> more<00:06:04.570> time

when you press key learn those codes

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.850 
when you press key learn those codes
will<00:06:41.280> show<00:06:41.550> up<00:06:41.700> on<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:43.110> key<00:06:43.260> learn<00:06:43.410> section
