00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.449
My mother warned me about getting into cars
with strange men.

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.629
This isn't a car.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.820
The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's celebrated
Batman trilogy has been breathlessly anticipated.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.890
But the Dark Knight's most unusual adventure
didn't involve Bane, or Catwoman, or The Joker

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.140
or The Riddler.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.180
It was solving the murders of the famous fashionistas
in Turkey.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.609
Holy remakes, Batman.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.149
I'm getting a rising feeling of Deja View.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.559
By the end of the 1960s, Batman had proven
that he could make himself at home in any

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.979
medium: graphic novels, radio, television,
film - even the Sunday funny pages.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.070
Moody or merry, it was all the same to the
caped crusader.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.130
So it's no great surprise that the campy Adam
West interpretation of the character was a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.600
hit around the world.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.189
But while Turkey's similarly tongue-in-cheek
take on Batman came only a handful of years

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:27.250
later in 1973, its biggest inspirations were
not what you might expect.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.149
In "Yarasa Adam," someone is murdering the
city's ten most stylish citizens, all of whom

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.789
have been insured for a suspiciously large
sum of money by an eccentric magazine

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.469
publisher.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.340
And, as one might imagine, only Batman and
Robin can get to the bottom of the mystery.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.320
Although based on a comic book icon and produced
just 7 years after the wildly popular 1966

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.570
"Batman" TV series, "Yarasa Adam" really owes
its pedigree to the American movie

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.950
serials of the 1930s and 40s.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.560
These were episodic adventure shorts which
played alongside a main feature.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.200
And they were a major influence to many Turkish
filmmakers of the Yesilcam period like Yılmaz

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.810
Atadeniz and Cetin Inanc.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.629
Serials like "Flash Gordon," "Spy Smasher,"
and "The Mysterious Dr. Satan" were adapted

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.640
for Turkish audiences throughout the 1960s
and ‘70s.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.930
And indeed, Batman himself starred in two
movie serials produced by Columbia Pictures

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.550
in 1943 and 1949.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.670
"Yarasa Adam's" action sequences in particular
really capture the flavor of the old serials,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.170
with rock'em-sock'em fisticuffs and acrobatics.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.360
Like Turkish genre pictures, budgets for serials
were universally minuscule, so in order to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.310
add interest, cheap action sequences - like
wild fist fights - were added whenever

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.879
possible.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.209
Another interesting point is that unlike their
comic book counterparts, Batman and Robin

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.060
are not vigilantes.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.120
Rather, they operate within the law as agents
of the authorities.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.799
This is notably similar to the 1943 Columbia
serial, in which the dynamic duo were portrayed

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.090
as agents of the FBI, in order to conform
to American censorship regulations.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.580
In Turkey as well, vigilantism was objectionable,
so it was more natural and acceptable for

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.819
the heroes to work for the police.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.060
But speaking of agents, "Yarasa Adam" adds
espionage appeal by borrowing from spy films

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.040
and television shows.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.099
The movie's mysterious villain, for example,
is only seen from behind his chair, caressing

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.819
his pet cat, in obvious homage to James Bond's
nemesis Blofeld.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.549
And when Batman receives his assignment, one
can't help but feel that his mission might

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.829
just be "impossible":

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.900
Moreover, virtually the entire score for the
film has been lifted from various spy movies

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.459
and TV shows.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.310
The result is a veritable "who's who" of secret
agent theme songs, including "On Her Majesty's

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.230
Secret Service," "I Spy," "Charade," and "Reilly:
Ace of Spies."

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.780
What might really surprise viewers, however,
is the film's adult content.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.829
Everyone knows about Batman's playboy lifestyle
as his alter ego Bruce Wayne, but he's got

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.669
nothing on Turkish Batman.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.500
Not only does he "get the girl"; but he also
brings home a beautiful stranger, and spends

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.710
a great deal of time with Robin at a local
strip club.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.460
Indeed, "Yarasa Adam" ventures completely
into sex comedy territory when Batman attempts

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.630
to fool love interest number one by disguising
love interest number two as a less than

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.900
convincing nurse.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.880
It's clear that secret identities are of no
concern to our heroes, and as such, Batman

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.660
and Robin spend as much time out of costume
as in them.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.610
In fact, even while suited up our heroes frequently
forego their capes, presumably to avoid hindering

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.880
their acrobatics.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.700
"Yarasa Adam" is pulp entertainment in its
most pure form: lurid, energetic, action-packed,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.370
and exploitative.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.990
And with a breezy 61 minute runtime, it's
impossible to get bored.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.890
For fans of Batman or connoisseurs of cheap
thrills, it's not to be missed.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.100
In a bizarre instance of Turkish copyright
infringement in reverse, in 2008, the mayor

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.289
of a small Turkish town attempted to sue Christopher
Nolan and Warner Bros. for the

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.580
unauthorized use of their town's name.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.979
The name?

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.359
Not Gotham City.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.240
Batman.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.919
Thanks so much for watching.

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.939
See you next Bat-time, same Bat-channel.
