time that I either do striking up a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040 
time that I either do striking up a
football<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.949> move<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> suddenly<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.019> just

pain I can't put any weight on it so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.810 
pain I can't put any weight on it so
once<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.899> sharp<00:00:34.230> pains<00:00:34.440> happened<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.610> me

once that sharp pains happened that's me
you<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.300> finish<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> couple<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> days

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you know finish for a couple of days

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.549 
you know finish for a couple of days
into<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.100> settles<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> hopefully<00:00:40.320> I've

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
into it settles down so hopefully I've

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.670 
into it settles down so hopefully I've
had<00:00:40.710> an<00:00:40.770> injection<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.520> should<00:00:42.559> help<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
had an injection that should help the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.430 
had an injection that should help the
area<00:00:44.129> around<00:00:44.370> where<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> bone<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
area around where the bone is and if it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
area around where the bone is and if it
does<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> summer<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
does do that in the summer just of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
does do that in the summer just of the
bone<00:00:48.120> sly<00:00:48.780> stuff<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> injection<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.430> not

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
bone sly stuff so the injection it's not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
bone sly stuff so the injection it's not
a<00:00:50.610> pain<00:00:50.879> killing<00:00:51.120> injection<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> bit

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a pain killing injection it is a bit

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.450 
a pain killing injection it is a bit
yeah<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.660> also<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:58.020> know

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
yeah but it's also a bit of you know

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.439 
yeah but it's also a bit of you know
inflammation<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.090> kill<00:01:00.270> any

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
inflammation that it will kill any

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.170 
inflammation that it will kill any
information<00:01:01.079> around<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> bun<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
information around the bun I with the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390 
information around the bun I with the
tendons<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> muscles<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.280> there's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
tendons or the muscles and there's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
tendons or the muscles and there's
actually<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.409> disperser<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.530> there

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually a little disperser in there

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually a little disperser in there
which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> m<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.750> our<00:01:09.930> blister<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
which is like a m and in our blister so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.920 
which is like a m and in our blister so
they've<00:01:11.939> hopefully<00:01:12.420> they've<00:01:12.570> popped<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
they've hopefully they've popped that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
they've hopefully they've popped that
little<00:01:13.260> blister<00:01:13.590> inside<00:01:18.560> would<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> take<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
little blister inside would you take the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
little blister inside would you take the
operation<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> any<00:01:20.580> weather<00:01:22.549> yeah<00:01:23.549> yeah<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
operation of any weather yeah yeah no I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
operation of any weather yeah yeah no I
think<00:01:24.540> he's<00:01:24.900> wise<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> done<00:01:26.159> whether

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
think he's wise to have it done whether

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
think he's wise to have it done whether
it's<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.240> injection<00:01:27.600> associate<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.200> not

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it's this injection associate or not

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.660 
it's this injection associate or not
because<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.310> could<00:01:29.490> be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because you know of why as I could be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
because you know of why as I could be
back<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.689> free<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.140> months<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
back for free for months and then it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
back for free for months and then it
happened<00:01:32.100> again<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
happened again and then you know I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
happened again and then you know I'm
back<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> square<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.140> again<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.680> hopefully

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
back to square one again so hopefully

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
back to square one again so hopefully
the<00:01:35.759> injection<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.360> tide<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.290> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the injection can tide me over to it in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.270 
the injection can tide me over to it in
this<00:01:37.560> season<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.150> enough<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> open<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:43.590> was

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this season and enough the open I was

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.179 
this season and enough the open I was
very<00:01:44.549> confident<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.049> sure<00:01:46.290> you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
very confident but now not so sure you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609

know I've come back and you know trained
for<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> week<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> was<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> bench

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
for a week and it was on the bench

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
for a week and it was on the bench
against<00:01:51.149> Watford<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.079> came<00:01:52.860> home<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.159> about

not<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.959> manager<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.070> they<00:02:46.190> should<00:02:46.400> be

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
not the manager that that they should be

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.130 
not the manager that that they should be
frustrating<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.209> think<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.630> players<00:02:47.840> if

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140
