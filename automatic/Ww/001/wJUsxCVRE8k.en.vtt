bit of a shame but it's not greasy
looking<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:45.829> like<00:02:45.889> I<00:02:46.310> sort<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.609> shame<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:47.060> it

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
concerned about using just all of my

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.800 
concerned about using just all of my
face<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.489> wanted<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> use<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:58.879> lotion<00:02:59.090> first<00:02:59.510> and

leave them out if they'll go back to
liquid<00:05:35.660> they<00:05:35.750> probably<00:05:35.900> will<00:05:36.200> but<00:05:36.560> by<00:05:36.860> its

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
liquid they probably will but by its

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.200 
liquid they probably will but by its
really<00:05:37.640> soft<00:05:37.850> I<00:05:38.270> know<00:05:39.080> if<00:05:39.410> it's<00:05:39.560> not<00:05:39.710> only<00:05:39.800> that

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
really soft I know if it's not only that

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.300

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
help them last longer also would be to

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.469 
help them last longer also would be to
keep<00:06:56.650> them<00:06:56.860> in<00:06:57.009> the<00:06:57.129> refrigerator<00:06:57.270> so<00:06:58.270> I'm<00:06:58.389> not
