00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
same side so we're checking the steering

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.420 
same side so we're checking the steering
now<00:02:20.140> we're<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:21.260> rich<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.799> he's<00:02:22.010> moving<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
now we're as rich as he's moving the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.789 
now we're as rich as he's moving the
tire<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.720> play<00:02:24.200> here

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
tire I can see that there is play here

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.240 
tire I can see that there is play here
in<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:26.180> uh<00:02:26.239> hora<00:02:27.140> here<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.650> which<00:02:27.769> means<00:02:28.010> we

in this uh hora here so which means we
need<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.579> replace<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.329> idler<00:02:29.540> arm<00:02:29.750> because<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
need to replace the idler arm because it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.370 
need to replace the idler arm because it
is<00:02:31.190> faulty<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:32.060> there<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.810> play<00:02:33.200> play<00:02:34.130> here<00:02:35.380> is

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
is faulty and there is play play here is

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.740 
is faulty and there is play play here is
the<00:02:36.440> type<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.799> Goodman<00:02:37.280> arm<00:02:37.549> but<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.359> center

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
the type of Goodman arm but the center

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.560 
the type of Goodman arm but the center
of<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.930> center<00:02:39.739> link<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.130> need<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.400> replace<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
of the center link we need to replace it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.630 
of the center link we need to replace it
is<00:02:41.900> give<00:02:42.590> me<00:02:42.709> too<00:02:42.859> much<00:02:42.950> play

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.690 

so<00:02:49.510> we<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.990> this<00:02:50.320> part<00:02:50.710> right<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.220> which<00:02:51.460> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
so we have this part right here which is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.750 
so we have this part right here which is
the<00:02:51.970> total<00:02:52.540> junk<00:02:52.840> asleep<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.950> what<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.190> does<00:02:54.400> is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
the total junk asleep so what it does is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.560 
the total junk asleep so what it does is
it<00:02:55.390> controls<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.470> distance<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:58.060> tie<00:02:58.270> rod

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it controls the distance of the tie rod

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.010 
it controls the distance of the tie rod
ends<00:02:59.140> which<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.590> turn<00:02:59.920> holds<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.550> wheel

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
ends which in turn holds the wheel

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.100 
ends which in turn holds the wheel
inwards<00:03:02.020> or<00:03:02.290> outwards<00:03:02.470> like<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:04.420> tyrant

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
inwards or outwards like this one tyrant

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.990 
inwards or outwards like this one tyrant
has<00:03:05.290> right-hand<00:03:05.830> threads<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.460> one<00:03:06.790> has

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
has right-hand threads and one has

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
has right-hand threads and one has
left-hand<00:03:07.510> threads<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.710> twist<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.130> one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
left-hand threads if you twist it one

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.790 
left-hand threads if you twist it one
way<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.850> will<00:03:10.090> push<00:03:10.390> out<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.990> tire<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.740> this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
way it will push out the tire like this

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.760 
way it will push out the tire like this
or<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.150> twisted<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> left<00:03:13.990> other<00:03:14.290> way<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
or if you twisted the left other way it

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.280 
or if you twisted the left other way it
will<00:03:15.040> pull<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:16.690> shortening<00:03:17.140> or

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
will pull in because it's shortening or

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
will pull in because it's shortening or
lengthening<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.070> distance<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.550> distance<00:03:18.580> of

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
lengthening the distance the distance of

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.020 
lengthening the distance the distance of
the<00:03:19.840> tie<00:03:20.020> rod<00:03:20.170> onto<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.590> tire<00:03:20.830> okay<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:21.670> we're

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
the tie rod onto the tire okay so we're

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.199 
the tie rod onto the tire okay so we're
checking<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.600> ball<00:03:22.780> joints<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:27.190> one<00:03:27.820> thing<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
checking the ball joints so one thing to

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.440 
checking the ball joints so one thing to
remember<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.770> if<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:31.090> spring

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
remember that is is that if the spring

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.710 
remember that is is that if the spring
right<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.320> is<00:03:32.610> connected<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.120> touching

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
right here is connected to the touching

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.260 
right here is connected to the touching
the<00:03:34.959> lower<00:03:35.170> control<00:03:35.470> arm<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.700> here<00:03:36.850> we<00:03:37.000> must

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
the lower control arm right here we must

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.090 
the lower control arm right here we must
place<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.720> jack<00:03:37.930> stands<00:03:38.290> underneath<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
place the jack stands underneath the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.880 
place the jack stands underneath the
controller<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.209> lower<00:03:40.420> controller<00:03:40.840> if<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.770> is

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
controller the lower controller if it is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.820 
controller the lower controller if it is
not<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.670> must<00:03:42.940> put<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.390> underneath<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.500> frame

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
not we must put it underneath the frame

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.530 
not we must put it underneath the frame
over<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:47.230> properly<00:03:48.100> low<00:03:48.730> unload<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
over here to properly low unload and

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.590 
over here to properly low unload and
unload<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.320> Baldwin's<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.180> is<00:03:55.360> how<00:03:55.540> you

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
unload the Baldwin's so this is how you

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.690 
unload the Baldwin's so this is how you
would<00:03:56.290> test<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.769> ball<00:03:56.920> joints<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.370> wiggle<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
would test the ball joints you wiggle it

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.270 
would test the ball joints you wiggle it
and<00:03:58.030> upward<00:03:58.900> motion<00:03:59.320> so<00:03:59.530> we're<00:03:59.739> doing<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.070> at

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
and upward motion so we're doing it at

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.199 
and upward motion so we're doing it at
this<00:04:00.489> motion<00:04:02.549> let's<00:04:03.549> check<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:03.820> playing

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
this motion let's check just playing

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.060 
this motion let's check just playing
here<00:04:04.360> we're<00:04:04.870> looking<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:05.799> we're<00:04:05.950> looking

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
here we're looking for as we're looking

here we're looking for as we're looking
at<00:04:06.400> me<00:04:06.519> for<00:04:06.700> any<00:04:06.880> play<00:04:07.209> between<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:09.640> upper

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
at me for any play between the upper

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.310 
at me for any play between the upper
control<00:04:10.360> arm<00:04:10.570> here<00:04:11.730> here<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.780> lower<00:04:14.019> control

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
control arm here here the lower control

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.060 
control arm here here the lower control
arm<00:04:14.530> here<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.540> here<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:17.470> looking<00:04:17.830> in<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
arm here and here so looking in the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.520 
arm here and here so looking in the
center's<00:04:18.549> right<00:04:19.180> here<00:04:19.450> for<00:04:19.840> any<00:04:20.019> any

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
center's right here for any any

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.890 
center's right here for any any
individual<00:04:21.310> move<00:04:21.489> any<00:04:21.700> play<00:04:22.060> right<00:04:22.900> now<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
individual move any play right now so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.630 
individual move any play right now so
you<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.229> see<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.620> there<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.010> little<00:04:27.400> play

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
you can see that there is little play

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.520 
you can see that there is little play
there's<00:04:27.970> no<00:04:28.150> playing<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.780> which<00:04:28.960> means<00:04:29.260> the
