 yes 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.520
 Gemma is a cheerful girl easy smile 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.680
 he goes to school and is learning to read his 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.440
 beautiful brown eyes me 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.330
 they observe with curiosity can not talk 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.820
 and they have very limited movements like 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.310
 consequence of cerebral palsy and 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.470
 with those eyes allied with technology 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.110
 is communicating little by little each time 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.539
 better with the world we find ourselves with 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.640
 gemma accompanied by her dad and her mom 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.260
 Antonio and Ruth in the library 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.050
 National hospital patients 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.450
 paraplegics the first thing ruth does is 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.570
 open the laptop and connect through 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.090
 usb port the speaker and iris system 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.399
 bond based on a technology 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.890
 called videoculography that analyzes the 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.440
 eye motor and allows to handle the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.270
 computer mouse with very iris 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.980
 an interface will soon appear on the screen 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.430
 for positioning and calibration 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.739
 of the eyes under a text that says 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.200
 positioning xv print appear the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.479
 gem eyes the little one looks very 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.399
 concentrated and with the security of which 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.469
 already it knows very well 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.730
 positioning requires placing the 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.250
 eyes in the distance 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.680
 adequate as indicated by a blue line already 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.530
 an optimal height that controls it a 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.290
 pink line when both parameters are 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 correct a red pilot gets on 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.990
 green then gem with the help of his mom 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.540
 proceeds to the calibration for it the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.880
 girl follows closely with the look a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.730
 gray circle that increases and decreases 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.970
 size and it moves around the screen every 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.640
 time for a noise that reminds you of 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.420
 of the cartoons 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 it sounds cheerfully 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.290
 this is a bit the most entertaining 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.100
 outcomes once 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.740
 - in the place that you put it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.080
 although he has been using the device for a short time 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.450
 Gemma is a smart girl and she already has the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.759
 look trained in a little while the system 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.840
 is configured she has now the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.489
 control thematic issues are 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 their families then well they are 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:19.290
 expressions people are clicked on each 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.650
 one of them and he's going to ask for one thing 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.650
 favor 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.760
 to see what you are going to ask me 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.719
 you are water the first thing that the little one does 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.890
 is asking for water and passing a kiss to his 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.140
 mother 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.050
 I ask you through this interview 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.870
 and with the help of mom show me how 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.440
 is learning to use the gemma system 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.990
 answer easily with a yes or a no 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.180
 closed questions or choose the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.440
 icons previously sorted by 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.720
 categories for open questions then 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.540
 it triggers a voice synthesizer that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.840
 remember the famous scientist 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 stephen hawking 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 mega 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.060
 where are the numbers 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.460

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.190
 through those levels other attractions 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.190
 Favourite 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.100

 which would talk to any girl of 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.080

 makes him laugh and the cousin laughed 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.950
 to learn fast soon to access 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.980
 the usual functions of a computer 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.160
 such as internet browsing or 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.100
 music watch videos and as soon as you read and 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.290
 write will produce messages that can 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.930
 be visualized directly in the 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.840
 screen printed or heard

 your visit to the national hospital 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.700
 paraplegics were interested in gemma and 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.230
 the iris monde that as we see supplies the 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.480
 mobility deficits for 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.849
 communication and increases the quality of 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.759
 lifetime 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.990
 and bond that won the queen Sofia award 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:21.419
 of accessibility technologies has 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.789
 developed an online platform that 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.339
 makes it possible to install the 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.529
 device and its maintenance so 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.539
 remote allowing for advice 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.300
 personalized anywhere in the 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:36.629
 world is also working on several 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.540
 programs and video games adapted to 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.850
 varying degrees of paralysis 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.730
 the gem brain is in full 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.340
 boiling has many ahead 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.730
 challenges among them learning to read 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.610
 to write and manage one hundred percent 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.400
 this technology that will make you more and more 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.230
 We have been independent in returning to 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.230
 see us and talk about life 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.540
