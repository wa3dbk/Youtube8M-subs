00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 I will knit a column facial relief 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.170
 column and generally referred to as convex 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.179
 column 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.179
 for this the first loop is again 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.830
 the resulting loop is a chain of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.840
 air loops do not take 10 air 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.980
 the loops remind that crochet movement out 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 index finger of the left hand 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 grabbing a working thread under the hook 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 akkas and stretch through the loop under 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:46.820
 crochet turns one loop further 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:50.730
 repeat 2 air loop 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 10 10 air loops to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.480
 knit relief facial and purl 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 bollards need to do the first row 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 with single crochets and so 3 loops 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 lifting and again not counting 3 loops 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.380
 lifting from the second loop ie 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.479
 if you count the hook fifth loop from 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.340
 hook knit row rows with 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.159
 nakidom nakid and giving a loop grab 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.470
 hook thread 3 loops 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.310
 I knit 2 loops and 2 peaks so 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 I repeat the way to the end of the first row 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.280
 three lift loops are counted as one 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 double crochet so no change 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 just tying up how would it be 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 the foundation 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.200
 embossed column so I especially 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.670
 I don't stop here how to knit 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 single crochets 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.689
 can watch other videos 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.689
 in details 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.470
 so now i'm finishing knitting a row 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.540
 double crochet 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.560
 knitted last double crochet 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.780
 this is the basis now I will have visas just these 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 facial embossed posts for 3 loops 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.140
 lifting turn work and now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.790
 I knit myself the front column do a coat with 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.060
 counterclockwise hook 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.239
 next I bring the hook from the inside out a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.680
 to the right of the column like this 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.170
 I go around the inside of the pole and pull the hook 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.420
 next gap to the left of the column 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.239
 over here 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.030
 grabbing a working thread and stretching and 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.950
 around the post 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.590
 on the hook 3 loops grab the worker 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.140
 thread and knit two peaks left on 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.819
 the hook, two loops grab the working thread 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.950
 I knit two peaks 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.730
 this is one facial relief column 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.130
 repeating nakid I introduce to and on the right 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.350
 double crochet 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.920
 I twist the column from the inside on the face and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.220
 I deduce from the other side of the column with the left 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.540
 face grabbing a working thread on 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.170
 the hook 3 loops knit 2 loops and 2 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.359
 peaks 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.489
 again put on the face inside out of the inside 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.650
 on the face 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.120
 I grabbed a working thread and I pull 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.010
 3 loops on the hook 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:58.290
 I knit 2 loops and 2 loops again wrap 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.870
 I bring from the inside out side of the face 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.579
 grabbing a working thread and tying 2 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.970
 loops and 2 what 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:11.380
 and so repeat as many times as I 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.160
 this case is required I will have 10 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.389
 embossed columns this will be facial 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.780
 bollards are also called in 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:26.650
 convex columns again reminders 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.200
 and kit around the column with the inside-out 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.260
 from seamy face to seize the worker 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.740
 thread on the hook 3 loops knit two 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.680
 loops and 2 loops nakida again from the face 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.910
 inside out to the right of the inside column 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.450
 face grabbing a working thread 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.980
 I pull on the hook 3 loops 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.200
 2 loops and 2 peaks and the last loop 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.750
 how it is edge and I 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.960
 I crochet with a crochet usually in 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.870
 third lifting loop 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.870
 in this way 3 more loops 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:14.430
 I expand the work and I knit the next row 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:17.410
 in the same way I put the caps inside out 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.900
 rounding the body of the post from the inside on the face 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.770
 I pull the hook grabbing the working thread 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.020
 Pull on the hook 3 loops knit 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:32.410
 two loops and 2 loops nape again 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.070
 inside from the inside face hook 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.919
 grabbing a working thread I pull on 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.150
 the hook 3 loops knit 2 loops and 2 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:48.280
 hinges and once again the person inside from the inside 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.620
 on the face so once again face up inside with 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.610
 seamy face grab working thread 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.000
 and pull 3 loops on the hook 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.640
 I knit 2 loops and 2 loops again wrap 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.430
 face upside down from semolina to face 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.450
 grabbing the workers thread and dragging on 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.900
 the hook 3 loops knit 2 loops and 2 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:14.350
 loops and repeating this way to the end 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.720
 rows like this so you can knit only rows 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.260
 how much do you need here the most 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.210
 the main thing is that the first column 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.919
 is 3 lifting loops and at the end 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.919
 edging also 3 lifting loops
