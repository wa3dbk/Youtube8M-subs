00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.400
 in the life of every cyclist arises 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.760
 the moment when you need to replace the camera 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.250
 for example, when it is punctured by the first stage 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 we will need to remove the wheel for this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 case of free brakes we stretch 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:28.019
 brakes second step released center 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 wheel attachment and remove the wheel further 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 we can leave the bike aside 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 for example, it is desirable to put on the ground 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.780
 do it on the left side in order 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 so as not to damage the rear derailleur 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 proceed with the process of extracting the camera in 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 first dismantle the tire for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.670
 of this we will need a pair barter 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.160
 vegetable shovels actually remove 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.300
 tire pre-run down the whole 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 air that could stay in the chamber and 1 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.879
 with a shovel we catch a tire overboard 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 in this way 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.420
 second spatula 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.689
 with this movement we extract the tire 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.579
 next we need to remove the camera from 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.840
 tires 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.689
 try not to dislodge the tire 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.659
 relative to the rim and when we take out 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.880
 cameras should maintain its position 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.979
 why do we need it if a puncture for example 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.079
 in some part then i puncture place 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.270
 we can find a puncture on the tire 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.869
 this will help us find for example 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.119
 remaining tire spike or guest in front 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.429
 How to install a new camera for us 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.709
 you need to check did not remain only tires 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.110
 the item that pierced previous 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.229
 camera for example hissed a piece of glass 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.409
 let's do it in a circular motion 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 feel the tire around the entire circumference 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.259
 after we made sure that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.659
 tires not left sharp objects 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.060
 who can pierce a new camera and 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.159
 flipper who is wearing a rim does not have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.349
 no damage proceed to the process 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.429
 installation of a new camera for this we put 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.429
 wheel on side 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.200
 insert the camera nipple into the hole in 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.200
 the rim 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.220
 note one side of the tire 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.780
 already wearing a rim i.e. unlocking 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.060
 must be on one side only 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.420
 We pump up the camera a little bit 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.420
 form 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:06.590
 further we fill the marking ring 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:09.500
 tires in the rim in this case tire 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.740
 sits down well so you can do it 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 hands we lift the wheel check to 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.440
 tire tire around the circumference 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.060
 then you can start the pumping process 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.060
 the camera is pumping up the wheel 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.580
 pumped up somewhere before given as alice 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580
 one and a half atmosphere 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.360
 seated tire 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.129
 we pump up the wheel to the recommended 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:04.049
 pressure manufacturers can 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:07.180
 look at the side of the tire 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.519
 there is a range from 40 to 60 psy 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.989
 swing within these limits depending on 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:18.459
 individual preferences 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:22.960
 From weight not for such so further temple 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.620
 ready to install install the wheel 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.620
 in reverse order 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.530
 wrap their son track with this 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:39.789
 create preliminary pressure on 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:42.610
 saddle such as elbow or chest with 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.880
 the cam should twist tight but 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.550
 without fanaticism and fasten rear 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.870
 brakes 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.050
 today we learned how to replace the camera 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.050
 bike wheel thanks for attention
