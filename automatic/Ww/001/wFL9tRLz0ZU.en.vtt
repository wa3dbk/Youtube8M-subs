buzzes<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:43.299> i<00:01:43.329> do<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:44.639> i<00:01:46.380> plug<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.679> battery

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:56.099 

to<00:01:50.859> this<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:53.999> the<00:01:54.999> charger<00:01:55.539> if<00:01:55.659> i<00:01:55.810> could<00:01:55.990> do

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
to this to the the charger if i could do

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.840 
to this to the the charger if i could do
this<00:01:56.200> with<00:01:56.409> one<00:01:56.560> hand

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.800 

so<00:02:01.850> i<00:02:01.910> plug<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:04.090> first<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.270> course<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
so i plug it in first of course the

so i plug it in first of course the
charge<00:02:06.350> has<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.740> be<00:02:06.860> plugged<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:08.720> you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
charge has to be plugged in and then you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.170 
charge has to be plugged in and then you
plug<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.290> in<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:11.200> can<00:02:12.200> do<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.880> hard

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
plug this in I can do this this is hard

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.360 
plug this in I can do this this is hard
especially<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.500> want<00:02:15.770> him<00:02:20.950> okay<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.250> how

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
especially we want him okay this is how
