drill four holes towards the bottom and
what<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.739> once<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:23.859> goes<00:03:24.100> together

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
what this is is once this goes together

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.990 
what this is is once this goes together
those<00:03:25.989> holes<00:03:26.350> are<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:27.040> about<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> half<00:03:27.790> inch

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
those holes are just about a half inch

bucket<00:03:31.829> way<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.069> works<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:35.590> have<00:03:35.769> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
bucket way this works is you have the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.879 
bucket way this works is you have the
plastic<00:03:37.720> up<00:03:37.870> there<00:03:38.049> which<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.380> acting<00:03:38.739> as<00:03:38.859> a

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
plastic up there which is acting as a

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.449 
plastic up there which is acting as a
wicking<00:03:39.370> cup<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.829> thing<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.190> filled

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
wicking cup and this thing is filled

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.420 
wicking cup and this thing is filled
with<00:03:42.519> your<00:03:42.730> soil<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:44.799> actually<00:03:45.190> wicks

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
with your soil and this actually wicks

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.460 
with your soil and this actually wicks
up<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.940> water<00:03:46.180> that'll<00:03:46.630> be<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.049> bottom<00:03:47.350> of

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
up the water that'll be at the bottom of

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.930 
up the water that'll be at the bottom of
this<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:50.049> water<00:03:50.260> goes<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.799> my<00:03:51.519> way<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
this and the water goes in my way of the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.629 
this and the water goes in my way of the
PVC<00:03:52.540> pipe<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.769> we'll<00:03:53.980> put<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.220> together<00:03:54.370> so

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
PVC pipe and we'll put it together so

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.849 
PVC pipe and we'll put it together so
you<00:03:54.850> get<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> better<00:03:55.750> understanding<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:56.650> what

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
you get a better understanding of what

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.069 
you get a better understanding of what
it's<00:03:57.040> for<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:58.889> on<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:01.090> plastic<00:04:01.510> cup<00:04:01.840> you'll

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
it's for but on your plastic cup you'll

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.900 
it's for but on your plastic cup you'll
take<00:04:02.319> your<00:04:02.700> box<00:04:03.700> knife<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:05.200> will<00:04:05.410> just

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
take your box knife and you will just

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.470 
take your box knife and you will just
cut

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
cut

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.839 
cut
flipz<00:04:09.140> in<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.560> cut<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.830> slit<00:04:10.159> about<00:04:10.370> every<00:04:10.670> one

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
flipz in it I cut a slit about every one

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.569 
flipz in it I cut a slit about every one
inch<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.670> allows<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.209> water<00:04:14.450> to

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
inch and that just allows the water to

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.280 
inch and that just allows the water to
wick<00:04:16.579> into<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.060> cup<00:04:17.269> into<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.660> soil<00:04:18.019> that's

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
wick into the cup into the soil that's

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.560 
wick into the cup into the soil that's
in<00:04:18.530> here<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.130> on<00:04:19.340> up<00:04:19.370> where<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.299> plant

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
in here and then on up where the plant

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.920 
in here and then on up where the plant
and<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.810> roots<00:04:20.840> are<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.340> put<00:04:22.639> this<00:04:22.820> together

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.240 

you<00:04:26.930> got<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.139> take<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.560> got<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.800> put<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.040> cup

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
you got to take you got to put the cup

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.409 
you got to take you got to put the cup
here<00:04:29.139> like<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:30.290> said<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:31.699> second<00:04:32.120> bucket<00:04:32.270> is

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
here like I said the second bucket is

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.570 
here like I said the second bucket is
going<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.690> be<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.500> outside<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.130> here<00:04:34.340> and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
going to be on the outside of here and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.370 
going to be on the outside of here and
so<00:04:34.729> this<00:04:34.910> will<00:04:35.090> all<00:04:35.240> be<00:04:35.389> have<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> water

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
so this will all be have a water

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.990 
so this will all be have a water
reservoir<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:37.040> you'll<00:04:37.220> actually<00:04:37.400> use<00:04:37.580> less

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
reservoir in you'll actually use less

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.860 
reservoir in you'll actually use less
water<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:39.530> grow<00:04:39.770> more<00:04:40.040> plants<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.720> more

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
water to grow more plants so it's more

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.390 
water to grow more plants so it's more
economical<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:44.300> your<00:04:44.479> watering<00:04:44.810> bill<00:04:45.400> but

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
economical with your watering bill but

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.750 
economical with your watering bill but
they'll<00:04:46.580> take<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:48.340> you'll<00:04:49.340> set<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.610> down

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
they'll take this you'll set it down

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.020 
went ahead and drill two on both sides
of<00:05:21.110> where<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.380> pipe<00:05:21.560> will<00:05:21.800> be<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.520> I<00:05:22.700> use<00:05:22.880> this

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
of where the pipe will be and I use this

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.500 
of where the pipe will be and I use this
in<00:05:23.240> place<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:24.820> anchor<00:05:27.550> my<00:05:28.550> stem<00:05:28.849> in<00:05:29.000> places<00:05:29.389> you

NotI there and that way is I'm putting
soil<00:05:33.979> in<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.760> pipe<00:05:35.000> isn't<00:05:35.240> moving<00:05:35.539> around<00:05:35.900> on

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
soil in the pipe isn't moving around on

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.240 
soil in the pipe isn't moving around on
me<00:05:36.260> I'm<00:05:36.349> not<00:05:36.470> trying<00:05:36.620> to<00:05:36.770> hold<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.010> pipe<00:05:37.190> in

one hand hold the bucket with the other

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.350 
one hand hold the bucket with the other
so<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.800> just<00:05:39.979> makes<00:05:40.160> life<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.520> little<00:05:40.669> simpler

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.850 

it<00:05:44.360> can<00:05:44.599> be<00:05:44.720> grown<00:05:44.900> in<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.169> ground<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.650> can<00:05:45.770> be

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
I'm going to step away from the camera

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.570 
I'm going to step away from the camera
and<00:05:51.080> take<00:05:51.260> it<00:05:51.349> off<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.620> tripod<00:05:51.889> so<00:05:52.099> you<00:05:52.400> can

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
and take it off the tripod so you can

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.370
