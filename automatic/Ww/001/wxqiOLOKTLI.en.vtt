00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.960
 because the desks would actively support national team 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.500
 Primary virtues not at all I like to have other players too 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.089
 reported 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.790
 Rain and thunderstorms and storm 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.279
 I really would not be overestimated if 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.199
 Jürgen Kunow is a bad example because anyway too thick Pröll 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.269
 want 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.660
 of course we had exactly where and how to win this is not 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.439
 in question 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.650
 The torn-up ones supplied by my soul's soul which this serves 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.939
 that we refer to the criticism and indecent 2the good light and holds 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 that is named in the morning 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.440
 why that was until now post office in Grunern constantly that one must not have and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.320
 You would not have finished if you did not care 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 Stick 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.180
 to be accepted as an excuse for what I do today I am not that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 Trend yes that's what you're doing right now 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 All of her few exceptions are not in the US the Queen and resists that 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.380
 speaker 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.430
 I thought of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.949
 Natascha ridiculous now really undeclared tick better nobody believes 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.380
 but there it will not do that you team did not do the six coaches 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 remains 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.020
 but when I talk to people about video I have the coach of their care 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.780
 about the consequences 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.260
 the bestseller 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.490
 I am reasonably end with self-praise 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.910
 I'll be back next week 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 Benedict 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 Benedikt Wiesend It's unbelievable what people look like in those moments 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.810
 would 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 Owen Pallett be career success 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.890
 but they can all the more or less 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.290
 not fat before this game 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 the whole tour, "he sounded 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.369
 but it is just one point to take away that's actually the power 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.519
 power is up to him 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.099
 the team 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.099
 No most banks today 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.649
 Nobody has done that yet and put it on
