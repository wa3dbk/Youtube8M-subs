00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
more rare alternative to it so a good

more rare alternative to it so a good
example<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.810> let's<00:02:52.200> say<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.379> have<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
example of this let's say you have a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.170 
example of this let's say you have a
black<00:02:52.859> heart<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.459> middle<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.819> room<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
black heart in the middle of a room and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.000 
black heart in the middle of a room and
it's<00:02:54.299> surrounded<00:02:54.720> by<00:02:54.720> metal<00:02:55.019> blocks<00:02:55.409> there's

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
it's surrounded by metal blocks there's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.710 
it's surrounded by metal blocks there's
a<00:02:56.129> chance<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.519> those<00:02:56.819> metal<00:02:57.180> blocks<00:02:57.420> could

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
a chance that those metal blocks could

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.360 
a chance that those metal blocks could
instead<00:02:58.019> just<00:02:58.200> become<00:02:58.560> rocks<00:02:58.859> making<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
instead just become rocks making the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.220 
instead just become rocks making the
heart<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.700> much<00:02:59.879> more<00:03:00.060> accessible<00:03:00.359> Edmund

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
heart that much more accessible Edmund

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.839 
heart that much more accessible Edmund
says<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:01.560> these<00:03:01.680> aspects<00:03:02.220> might<00:03:02.430> seem<00:03:02.670> minor

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
says that these aspects might seem minor

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.160 
says that these aspects might seem minor
but<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.359> allow<00:03:03.629> for<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> seemingly

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
but they really allow for a seemingly

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
but they really allow for a seemingly
endless<00:03:04.409> game<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.310> appear<00:03:05.670> endless

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
endless game to really appear endless

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.119 
endless game to really appear endless
and<00:03:06.180> I'm<00:03:06.359> inclined<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.750> agree<00:03:06.900> because<00:03:07.290> 500

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
and I'm inclined to agree because 500

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.270 
and I'm inclined to agree because 500
room<00:03:08.340> types<00:03:08.670> per<00:03:09.030> chapter<00:03:09.389> is<00:03:09.780> insanity<00:03:10.680> like
