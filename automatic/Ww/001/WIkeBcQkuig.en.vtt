00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hey I'm tactic man 356 and this is how

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.400 
hey I'm tactic man 356 and this is how
you<00:00:03.870> build<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.500> bike<00:00:05.130> rack<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:06.080> a

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
you build a bike rack and a

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.759 
you build a bike rack and a
have<00:00:09.410> fun<00:00:09.760> so<00:00:10.760> first<00:00:11.570> you'd<00:00:11.959> start<00:00:12.320> out<00:00:12.500> with

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
have fun so first you'd start out with

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.660 
have fun so first you'd start out with
three<00:00:13.580> like<00:00:14.570> little<00:00:14.959> blocks<00:00:15.320> of<00:00:15.619> wood<00:00:15.770> think

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
three like little blocks of wood think

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.000 
three like little blocks of wood think
about<00:00:16.939> that<00:00:17.180> thick<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:17.779> then<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:18.560> take<00:00:18.770> two

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
about that thick and then you take two

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.700 
about that thick and then you take two
smaller<00:00:19.400> ones<00:00:19.570> nail<00:00:20.570> these<00:00:20.840> together<00:00:21.140> and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
smaller ones nail these together and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.370 
smaller ones nail these together and
then<00:00:22.369> take<00:00:22.609> another<00:00:22.640> top<00:00:23.240> one<00:00:23.539> I<00:00:23.720> take<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> top

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
then take another top one I take a top

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.490 
then take another top one I take a top
one<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:24.770> just<00:00:25.400> nail<00:00:25.730> that<00:00:25.990> but<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.020> use<00:00:27.350> the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
one and just nail that but I use the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.370 
one and just nail that but I use the
nail<00:00:27.680> gun<00:00:27.710> for<00:00:28.190> this<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.580> then<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:29.210> take<00:00:29.420> back

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
nail gun for this and then you take back

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.670 
nail gun for this and then you take back
piece<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.070> cut<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:31.699> in<00:00:31.850> like<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.390> weird<00:00:33.230> shape

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
piece and cut it in like a weird shape

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.830 
piece and cut it in like a weird shape
and<00:00:34.120> it's<00:00:35.120> like<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:36.489> so<00:00:37.539> that's<00:00:38.539> how<00:00:38.780> you

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
and it's like that so that's how you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.049 
and it's like that so that's how you
build<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.230> bike<00:00:39.410> rack<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.760> build<00:00:40.909> a

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
build a bike rack and to build a

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.040 
build a bike rack and to build a
halfpipe<00:00:41.530> you<00:00:42.530> take<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:43.729> cut<00:00:43.999> this<00:00:44.390> out<00:00:44.690> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
halfpipe you take you cut this out and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.500 
halfpipe you take you cut this out and
then<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.039> cut<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.519> out<00:00:46.729> on<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.269> other<00:00:47.389> side

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
then you cut it out on the other side

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.430 
then you cut it out on the other side
too<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.139> then<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:48.800> take<00:00:49.120> planks<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.300> wood<00:00:50.440> and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
too and then you take planks of wood and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.059 
too and then you take planks of wood and
like<00:00:51.739> nail<00:00:52.609> them<00:00:52.909> together<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.659> tell<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.409> until

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
like nail them together I tell you until

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.469 
like nail them together I tell you until
you<00:00:55.370> get<00:00:55.519> all<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.909> way<00:00:55.999> to<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.210> other<00:00:56.329> side

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
you get all the way to the other side

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.399 
you get all the way to the other side
all<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.019> way<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.469> way<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.539> then<00:00:59.539> now<00:01:00.170> i'm

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
all the way this way and then now i'm

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:31.340 
all the way this way and then now i'm
going<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:00.649> write<00:01:00.889> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:40.249 

and<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:34.110> put<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.189> flight<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:38.720> put<00:01:39.720> put

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and to put it in the flight back put put

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.670 
and to put it in the flight back put put
it<00:01:40.350> down<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:46.460> put<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.670> bike

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
it down and then you would put your bike

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
it down and then you would put your bike
inside<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.190> just<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.940> lay<00:01:51.680> lay<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
inside of it and just like lay lay it so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.570 
inside of it and just like lay lay it so
that<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.759> sideways<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
that it's like sideways kind of so that

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.999 
that it's like sideways kind of so that
just<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.119> case<00:01:57.330> you're<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.770> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
is how build a bike rack and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.130 
is how build a bike rack and
that's<00:02:37.520> great<00:02:37.990> okay

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.740 

don't
