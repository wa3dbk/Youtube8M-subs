00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.469
 you would get the option to use that pdf 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.460
 open in another program 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 on the ipad that is not possible yet, but it is possible that the type prevails 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.390
 save according to me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380
 I have learned nothing about what you bought now for a short performance 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 then you have experience in mole 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.070
 comes on 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.290
 doorbell effect 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.020

 then you hit the squat walk 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 and then 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.859
 still short but it was opened recently 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.859
 and then the stand will be downloaded there 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.349
 but the english club world 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.090
 because of this stays on the authority of the mogens experience you get a notification 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 that more than ever is steadily testing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.979
 you see in the background 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:33.659
 that the pdf has been downloaded from the deductions just had some experience 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.129
 and there he is already 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.580

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.949
 read 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.949
 it concludes that you are there too 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.749
 this is is 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.319
 apply at pds point 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 before he was questioned in her 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.539
 Monday hit the second with 6 or you 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.129
 a copy boy can save and save the pdf or simply in the pdf itself 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.899
 and the prince himself up 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.589
 because I am now 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:09.599
 were ready 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 with a document print 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.249
 so that 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.780
 reason there is immediately adjusted by train 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.729
 the notes 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.759
 but now you have now 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.339
 shortly before but it may of course be that you are not just us either 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.450
 have to learn to live because, for example, a pdf book is your talent 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.469
 what you would like to maintain would be pokémon with my stomach 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.199
 manager vaals 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.269
 and then 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.539
 select 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.039
 the document 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.319
 what you will open somewhere else and then you have in here 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.810
 shortly before that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.159
 the option to open the documents in another location 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.699
 he books supports p to put the fall classes on wall street 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.549
 you can transfer them to the cia plus 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.979
 With that you can say a club and the supporters 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.059
 and a few other applications that support operating 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.309
 3 you can also choose to put the suitcase 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.520
 after becomes your laptop or your PC 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.889
 and you don't do that with the opening 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:09.800
 but that hurts 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.899
 with to box 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.989
 a dropbox account feed that did that 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.449
 and they were selected 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.609
 then make the connections dropbox 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.729
 they are all possible 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.529
 that I have on the gong boxmeer 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.520
 I suppose 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.650
 that pdf 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.259
 which means that after the short kür the following tour is full speed 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.650
 I say a spa 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.580
 I select the document 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.430
 I also only had one accepting 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.490
 and I also never a document 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.259
 the hague probooks 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.120
 because I 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.510
 it is rumbling on my laptop first to exist as you already have 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.219
 cheerful and open a laptop 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.720
 and robots synchronize it 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.540
 will that 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.479
 keep that pdf document 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.460
 namely top even if at that time the ipad no longer press online 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.900
 that is nice of tom boxing a few times so can cooperate with it a lot 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.919
 couple 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.779
 but bystanders happened 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.319
 and now I have 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.169
 that pdf is done from a webpage after my pet 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.210
 I forwarded one to the top box and 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:18.419
 if I want to 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.889
 creaking, too 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.249
 to open 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.719
 in standard rapper for example shows that it works 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.150
 the king 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
 besides doing all that 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.300
 after what they document 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.419
 also opened 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.480
 nac made 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.949
 just read well 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.250
 sander the rose 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.599
 the standard 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:42.950
 and it was the direction 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.210
 and that will not look very good in class 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.150
 now it is flat 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.210
 because man with your ipad you can of course easily 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.499
 to turn 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:53.079
 to the extent that
