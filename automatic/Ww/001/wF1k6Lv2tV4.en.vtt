00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
paths how he could have his comeback

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
paths how he could have his comeback
after<00:02:06.780> four<00:02:07.140> weeks<00:02:07.350> after<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> terrible

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.870 
accident and be fourth in Monza first
race<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:15.769> think<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:17.130> biggest<00:02:17.340> challenge

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
race I think the biggest challenge

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640 
race I think the biggest challenge
really<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:19.160> trying<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:21.230> recreate<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
really is trying to recreate on a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.680 
really is trying to recreate on a
reasonable<00:02:23.160> budget<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.910> global<00:02:24.329> nature<00:02:24.510> of

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
reasonable budget the global nature of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.720 
reasonable budget the global nature of
the<00:02:25.200> sport<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.010> intensity<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:28.730> we've

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the sport and the intensity of it we've

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.640 
the sport and the intensity of it we've
done<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.000> realistic<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.569> possible<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.140> any

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
done is realistic as possible so any

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.530 
done is realistic as possible so any
maneuvers<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.370> look<00:02:32.549> hairy<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.030> close<00:02:33.239> is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
maneuvers that look hairy or close is

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.970 
maneuvers that look hairy or close is
actually<00:02:33.989> precision<00:02:34.410> driving<00:02:34.620> that's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
actually precision driving that's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.220 
actually precision driving that's
basically<00:02:35.549> what<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.900> look<00:02:40.049> as

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
basically what we do we make it look as

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.479 
basically what we do we make it look as
real<00:02:40.379> as<00:02:40.410> possible<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.099> only<00:02:41.250> way<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
real as possible and the only way you

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.830 
real as possible and the only way you
can<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.299> really<00:02:42.599> close<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
can do that is to get really close and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.869 
can do that is to get really close and
have<00:02:43.200> hair-raising<00:02:43.769> moments<00:02:43.799> otherwise<00:02:44.700> your

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
have hair-raising moments otherwise your

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.130 
have hair-raising moments otherwise your
audience<00:02:45.090> students<00:02:45.390> isn't<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> believe

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
audience students isn't going to believe

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:58.979 
audience students isn't going to believe
how<00:02:46.860> exciting<00:02:47.400> form<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.849> was<00:02:48.090> there

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.910 

the<00:02:59.989> hardest<00:03:00.260> thing<00:03:00.319> with<00:03:00.469> the<00:03:00.530> swim<00:03:00.709> there's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the hardest thing with the swim there's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.869 
the hardest thing with the swim there's
so<00:03:01.010> many<00:03:01.069> moving<00:03:01.340> parts

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
so many moving parts
