00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.460
 tiger crews collaborate 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.440
 closely in combat under orders 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.719
 of a seasoned chef sitting in his 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.820
 ventilated turret with at his feet the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.980
 shooter who enjoy the excellent 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 vision his cupola was looking for targets 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 and link the instructions via 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.920
 interphone 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.570
 even if an appropriate step on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.080
 the shooter's shoulder can replace 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.080
 this one 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.880
 instruction manuals of ch artigues 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.330
 recall some basic principles for 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.330
 crew 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.160
 front armor is virtually 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.180
 indestructible by the dear enemies 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.180
 located more than 800 meters 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.140
 the protection can still be improved 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.730
 by tilting the position of the chariot when 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.970
 he finds himself in front of a case in 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.970
 the enemy 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.450
 turn the tank 8 to 10 degrees 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.010
 is equivalent to an increase of 3 cm 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.180
 armouring 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.200
 it means that the enemy has to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.060
 closer together and more he gets 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.060
 closer together it is easy to destroy 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 use the so-called time method of 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.500
 meal to have the best protection 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.500
 possible 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.420
 means that the tank must always 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.900
 present its most protected angle 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 was going to me 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.170
 this diagram from a manual of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.300
 fight shows the most points 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.620
 resistant tiger and where the costs of 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.990
 the enemy are likely to arrive 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.760
 from the most direct angle when 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.620
 faced more than one opponent at the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 times use the time method of the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.850
 meal facing the first one allows the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 tiger crews to engage to destroy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 other expenses and a half before 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.800
 simply reorient the turret for 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 finally destroy that first tank this 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.400
 work on distances and method 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.870
 of the cloverleaf means that the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 tank commander can calculate the distance 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.020
 to which he could leave the enemy 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.080
 approaching since different 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080
 directions 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 to improve the effectiveness of 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.930
 the main armament this one was endowed 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.150
 excellent sighting optics and 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.010
 a very simple system allowing 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.690
 determine the distance accurately 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.150
 up to about 2700 m accuracy is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.560
 the impact energy of the barrel 88 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.970
 were taken into account in the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.970
 tactics of thinkers units 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.910
 the tank leaders had 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.380
 very strict instructions on the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.500
 how to effectively manage their 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.500
 angels 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.910
 one of the main points stipulated to be 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.280
 not do this by rolling to keep 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.630
 the maximum accuracy and maximize 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.630
 the effect and 40 90 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.769
 at the beginning of the war while the tiger 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.180
 was still in development 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.120
 various combat tactics were 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.099
 studied she officials well into 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.319
 ideal conditions and with a number 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.879
 enough tanks but as the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.310
 war evolve the conditions 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.530
 commitment the availability and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.709
 shortages have inspired a more 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.709
 pragmatic 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.210
 during their first engagement 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.030
 the typical organization of 501st and 500 3rd 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.310
 battalion was four platoons souk 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.510
 in German including each of them 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.510
 tiger and two out of three 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.480
 accompanied by an extra peloton 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.480
 with a tig and two thinkers 3 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.590
 these tiger formations which is a 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.240
 bad surprise for buses to 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.870
 leningrad in 1942 two later in 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.000
 North Africa 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.680
 the allies had to rethink their tactics 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 to face the German army 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.620
 the tanks sent to reinforce robben 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.370
 during the campaign of Tunisia in March 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.910
 1943 was not in sand africa corsica or 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.910
 yellow sand
