00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
but putting it here now I think I'm

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.600 
but putting it here now I think I'm
gonna<00:04:51.480> need<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:52.020> bigger<00:04:52.860> strap<00:04:53.490> at<00:04:53.970> which<00:04:54.290> yes

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
gonna need a bigger strap at which yes

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.810 
gonna need a bigger strap at which yes
it<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.790> too<00:04:57.530> small<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:59.310> fit<00:04:59.340> around<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.720> shaft

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
it is too small to fit around this shaft

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.150 
it is too small to fit around this shaft
unless<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.330> really<00:05:04.140> really<00:05:04.860> stretchy<00:05:05.450> but

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:18.240 

I<00:05:14.670> wouldn't<00:05:15.670> want<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.890> stretch<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.070> any

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
I wouldn't want to stretch that any

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.090 
I wouldn't want to stretch that any
further<00:05:18.490> than<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.820> had<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:20.620> probably<00:05:20.950> will

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
further than I had to it probably will

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:30.890 
further than I had to it probably will
take<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:24.700> stretch<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.200> think<00:05:29.890> I<00:05:30.130> will

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
take the stretch but I think I will

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.440 
take the stretch but I think I will
leave<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:32.080> here
