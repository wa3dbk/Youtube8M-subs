00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
anywhere give you an idea of how it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.920 
anywhere give you an idea of how it
looks<00:02:11.650> with<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.790> comparison<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> size<00:02:13.720> of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
looks with in comparison to the size of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.430 
looks with in comparison to the size of
the<00:02:14.050> shoe<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.560> know<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.940> about<00:02:16.270> an<00:02:16.600> inch<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the shoe you know it's about an inch and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.250 
the shoe you know it's about an inch and
a<00:02:17.470> half<00:02:17.500> long<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.430> too<00:02:18.640> bad<00:02:18.820> at<00:02:18.940> all

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a half long so it's not too bad at all

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
a half long so it's not too bad at all
so<00:02:21.090> when<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.240> on<00:02:22.390> your<00:02:22.420> shoe<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.100> all

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
we're going to want to go and open up

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.790 
we're going to want to go and open up
the<00:02:36.100> polar<00:02:36.459> app<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.930> comes<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.380> you're

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the polar app and this comes up you're

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.930 
the polar app and this comes up you're
going<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> want<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.130> connect<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.610> we<00:02:39.760> hit

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
going to want to connect it so we hit

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.470 
going to want to connect it so we hit
settings<00:02:40.270> get<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.320> stride<00:02:41.739> sensor<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.610> it'll

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
settings get a stride sensor and it'll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.199 
settings get a stride sensor and it'll
come<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.840> it'll<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.580> dare<00:02:45.850> more<00:02:46.030> than

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
come up it'll have if you dare more than

one person using it I'm in the room it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.770 
one person using it I'm in the room it
has<00:02:48.340> an<00:02:48.459> ID<00:02:48.640> on<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.030> back<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.390> sensor

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
has an ID on the back of the sensor

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.080 
has an ID on the back of the sensor
they'll<00:02:49.959> tell<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.910> we're

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
just going to hit pair here and you're

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.260 
just going to hit pair here and you're
all<00:02:56.110> set<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:57.040> it'll<00:02:57.280> give<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.610> directions<00:02:57.940> how

all set so it'll give you directions how

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.170 
all set so it'll give you directions how
to<00:02:58.300> calibrate<00:02:58.660> um<00:02:59.610> basically<00:03:00.610> what<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.150> is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
to calibrate um basically what you do is

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.670 
to calibrate um basically what you do is
you<00:03:01.360> run<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.630> distance<00:03:02.140> say<00:03:02.290> you're<00:03:02.470> going<00:03:02.620> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
you run a distance say you're going to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.110 
you run a distance say you're going to
run<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> track<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.489> going<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.730> run<00:03:03.880> one

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
run the track you're going to run one

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.590 
run the track you're going to run one
mile<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.600> know<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.140> exists<00:03:05.680> exactly<00:03:06.459> one<00:03:07.330> mile

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
mile you know it exists exactly one mile

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.530 
mile you know it exists exactly one mile
you<00:03:08.350> would<00:03:08.470> go<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> then<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:10.360> go

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
you would go do that and then you go

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.560 
you would go do that and then you go
back<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.840> your<00:03:10.959> run<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.530> click<00:03:12.120> calibrate<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
back to your run and click calibrate and

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.250 
back to your run and click calibrate and
you<00:03:13.989> be<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.230> set<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.890> I'm<00:03:15.459> going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.640> start<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
you be all set so I'm going to start it

real quick you get an idea of how it
works<00:04:00.960> alright<00:04:01.960> so<00:04:02.140> as<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.470> see<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:04.390> has<00:04:04.540> a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
works alright so as you can see it has a

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.480 
works alright so as you can see it has a
little<00:04:04.750> graph<00:04:05.110> I'm<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.190> show<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.310> how

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
little graph I'm going to show you how

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.910 
little graph I'm going to show you how
fast<00:04:06.820> you're<00:04:07.120> running<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:08.200> distance<00:04:08.680> shows

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
fast you're running the distance shows

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.730 
fast you're running the distance shows
you<00:04:09.070> pace<00:04:09.370> over<00:04:09.610> time<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.210> everything<00:04:10.740> can

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
you pace over time and everything can

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
you pace over time and everything can
also<00:04:11.920> go<00:04:12.070> from<00:04:12.250> speed<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:13.660> can<00:04:13.810> click<00:04:14.110> pace

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
also go from speed you can click pace

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.240 
also go from speed you can click pace
you<00:04:15.760> know<00:04:15.790> do<00:04:16.600> whatever<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.959> want<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:18.160> will
