00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Devils first to Philadelphia Flyers my

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.340 
Devils first to Philadelphia Flyers my
prediction<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.480> match<00:00:57.840> is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.560 

reason<00:01:03.070> why<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.190> think<00:01:03.489> New<00:01:03.640> Jersey<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.330> going

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
reason why I think New Jersey is going

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.149 
reason why I think New Jersey is going
to<00:01:04.629> take<00:01:04.750> Philadelphia<00:01:05.259> Flyers<00:01:05.619> out<00:01:05.860> in<00:01:05.979> five

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
to take Philadelphia Flyers out in five

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.219 
to take Philadelphia Flyers out in five
games<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.670> pretty<00:01:06.909> simple<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.659> Philadelphia

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
games is pretty simple the Philadelphia

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.780 
games is pretty simple the Philadelphia
Flyers<00:01:08.380> got<00:01:08.740> lucky<00:01:09.070> they<00:01:09.310> won<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.759> shootout

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
Flyers got lucky they won in a shootout

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.270 
Flyers got lucky they won in a shootout
the<00:01:10.270> only<00:01:10.540> reason<00:01:10.840> why<00:01:11.020> they're<00:01:11.320> here<00:01:11.619> facing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the only reason why they're here facing

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.950 
the only reason why they're here facing
the<00:01:12.490> new<00:01:12.700> jersey<00:01:13.060> devils<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.570> because<00:01:13.810> they

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
the new jersey devils is because they

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960 
the new jersey devils is because they
want<00:01:14.229> in<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.440> shootout<00:01:14.799> that's<00:01:15.399> pretty<00:01:15.700> lucky

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
want in a shootout that's pretty lucky

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.300 
want in a shootout that's pretty lucky
and<00:01:16.500> considering<00:01:17.500> all<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.890> injuries<00:01:18.189> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
and considering all the injuries the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.620 
and considering all the injuries the
Flyers<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.759> thought<00:01:18.909> yes<00:01:19.119> they<00:01:19.330> have<00:01:19.420> Jeff

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
Flyers of thought yes they have Jeff

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.660 
Flyers of thought yes they have Jeff
Carter<00:01:19.869> back<00:01:20.140> but<00:01:20.470> Michael<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:20.890> can<00:01:21.070> who<00:01:21.640> I

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
Carter back but Michael I can who I

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.130 
Carter back but Michael I can who I
think<00:01:21.909> is<00:01:22.240> their<00:01:22.390> number<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.690> ulta<00:01:22.960> they're

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
think is their number of ulta they're

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.560 
think is their number of ulta they're
still<00:01:23.470> injured<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:25.119> new<00:01:25.240> jersey<00:01:25.539> devils

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
still injured and the new jersey devils

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.389 
still injured and the new jersey devils
have<00:01:25.960> great<00:01:26.229> scoring<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.799> great<00:01:26.979> goaltender

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
have great scoring and great goaltender

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.859 
have great scoring and great goaltender
martin<00:01:27.640> brodeur<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.149> that's<00:01:28.270> what<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.539> think

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
martin brodeur so that's what I think

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.710 
martin brodeur so that's what I think
next<00:01:29.619> up<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.070> buffalo<00:01:30.399> sabres<00:01:30.430> vs<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.330> Boston

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
next up the buffalo sabres vs the Boston

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.440 
next up the buffalo sabres vs the Boston
Bruins<00:01:31.840> as<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.409> see<00:01:32.590> right<00:01:32.799> here<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.610> think

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
Bruins as you can see right here I think

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.050 
Bruins as you can see right here I think
that<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> final<00:01:35.140> scoring<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.580> match

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
that the final scoring of this match

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.020 
that the final scoring of this match
will<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:42.100> reason<00:01:42.220> why<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:42.460> think<00:01:42.759> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
will be the reason why I think the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.910 
will be the reason why I think the
Buffalo<00:01:43.390> Sabres<00:01:43.420> will<00:01:43.840> beat<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.590> boston

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
Buffalo Sabres will beat the boston

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.730 
Buffalo Sabres will beat the boston
bruins<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.310> five<00:01:45.490> games<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:45.970> quite<00:01:46.240> simple

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
bruins the five games is quite simple

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680 
bruins the five games is quite simple
Buffalo<00:01:47.940> personally<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.000> think<00:01:49.119> buffalo<00:01:49.600> has

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
Buffalo personally I think buffalo has

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.809 
Buffalo personally I think buffalo has
the<00:01:49.840> best<00:01:49.990> goaltender<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.770> now<00:01:50.950> an<00:01:51.130> NHL<00:01:51.580> in

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
the best goaltender right now an NHL in

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.210 
the best goaltender right now an NHL in
Roy<00:01:52.090> Miller<00:01:52.270> he's<00:01:52.479> great<00:01:52.810> goaltender<00:01:53.350> he<00:01:54.039> gets

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
Roy Miller he's great goaltender he gets

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.490 
Roy Miller he's great goaltender he gets
the<00:01:54.369> job<00:01:54.549> done<00:01:54.610> when<00:01:55.000> he<00:01:55.149> needs<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.569> Boston

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
will sweep the series is because the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.540 
will sweep the series is because the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
could be like the Edmonton Oilers of

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.730 
could be like the Edmonton Oilers of
what<00:03:17.090> was<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:17.390> year<00:03:17.660> two<00:03:17.870> thousand<00:03:18.230> five<00:03:18.410> when

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
what was it year two thousand five when

top-seeded<00:03:21.590> detroit<00:03:22.040> red<00:03:22.220> wings<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.580> we'll

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
top-seeded detroit red wings so we'll

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.460 
top-seeded detroit red wings so we'll
see<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.330> think<00:03:23.660> you'll<00:03:23.750> go<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.960> game<00:03:24.170> seven

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
but San Jose Sharks I think we'll move

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.850 
but San Jose Sharks I think we'll move
on<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.630> second<00:03:26.930> round<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.170> playoffs<00:03:27.500> stop

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
favorite team but they are obviously a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.460 
favorite team but they are obviously a
great<00:03:43.370> team<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:44.000> john<00:03:44.300> settees<00:03:44.630> Patrick

great team with john settees Patrick
Kane<00:03:45.650> great<00:03:46.040> players<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.270> problem<00:03:47.450> is

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
Kane great players but the problem is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.540

has<00:03:50.120> been<00:03:50.360> pretty<00:03:50.660> good<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.930> season<00:03:51.290> but<00:03:52.100> he

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
has been pretty good this season but he

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.430 
has been pretty good this season but he
has<00:03:52.940> no<00:03:53.210> playoff<00:03:53.570> experience<00:03:53.720> but<00:03:54.410> I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
has no playoff experience but I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.330 
has no playoff experience but I
definitely<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.980> they're<00:03:55.160> going<00:03:55.250> to

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
definitely think that they're going to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.250 
definitely think that they're going to
win<00:03:55.460> in<00:03:55.580> five<00:03:55.730> games<00:03:55.970> because<00:03:56.450> Nashville<00:03:56.990> I

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
win in five games because Nashville I

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.110 
win in five games because Nashville I

don't even know why natural is in the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.480 
don't even know why natural is in the
playoffs<00:03:59.540> or<00:03:59.780> not<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.960> great<00:04:00.260> team<00:04:00.440> at<00:04:00.560> all<00:04:00.770> the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
playoffs or not a great team at all the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.220 
playoffs or not a great team at all the
like<00:04:01.670> who<00:04:01.820> is<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.210> rest<00:04:02.390> player<00:04:02.630> on<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> team

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
Goc that's about it anyways I think the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.720 
Goc that's about it anyways I think the
box<00:04:08.300> will<00:04:08.540> win<00:04:08.660> five<00:04:08.990> but<00:04:09.590> mostly<00:04:10.490> what's

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
box will win five but mostly what's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.520 
box will win five but mostly what's
going<00:04:10.910> on<00:04:11.030> next<00:04:11.480> up<00:04:11.600> we<00:04:11.870> have<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.990> vancouver

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
going on next up we have the vancouver

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.750 
going on next up we have the vancouver
canucks<00:04:12.730> vs<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.940> los<00:04:14.120> angeles<00:04:14.420> kings<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:16.549> my

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
canucks vs the los angeles kings and my

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.160 
canucks vs the los angeles kings and my
outcome<00:04:17.120> for<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.450> series<00:04:17.870> is

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.810 

the<00:04:23.170> reason<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.500> think<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.250> going<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.640> be<00:04:24.790> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
the reason I think this is going to be a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.600 
the reason I think this is going to be a
seven-game<00:04:25.390> series<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.990> quite<00:04:26.140> simple<00:04:26.610> it's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
seven-game series is quite simple it's

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.790 
seven-game series is quite simple it's
going<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.760> be<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> great<00:04:28.300> series<00:04:28.570> i<00:04:28.870> think<00:04:28.900> or

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
going to be a great series i think or

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.040 
going to be a great series i think or
could<00:04:30.220> not<00:04:30.250> but<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.760> is<00:04:30.820> what<00:04:31.090> i<00:04:31.120> think<00:04:31.510> on

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
could not but this is what i think on

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.660 
could not but this is what i think on
the<00:04:32.470> vancouver<00:04:32.860> canucks<00:04:32.890> are<00:04:33.250> obviously<00:04:33.580> i

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
the vancouver canucks are obviously i

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.250 
the vancouver canucks are obviously i
think<00:04:33.880> going<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.060> take<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.390> because<00:04:34.840> they

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
think going to take this because they

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.230 
think going to take this because they
have<00:04:35.470> playoff<00:04:35.860> experience<00:04:36.060> they<00:04:37.060> have

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
to be a great series but I personally

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.470 
to be a great series but I personally
think<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.520> Vancouver<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.120> going<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.300> come

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
think that Vancouver is going to come

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.850 
think that Vancouver is going to come
out<00:04:55.600> with<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.960> win<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:57.160> last<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.520> not<00:04:57.670> least

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
out with the win and last but not least

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.560 
out with the win and last but not least
the<00:04:59.860> Phoenix<00:05:00.250> Coyotes<00:05:00.400> worse<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.180> detroit

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the Phoenix Coyotes worse the detroit

the Phoenix Coyotes worse the detroit
red<00:05:01.840> wings<00:05:02.370> my<00:05:03.370> prediction<00:05:03.730> for<00:05:04.120> this<00:05:04.420> series

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
red wings my prediction for this series

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.110 
red wings my prediction for this series
is

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.270 

although<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:09.960> am<00:05:10.110> Sodom<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:10.949> personally

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
although I am Sodom and I personally

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.740 
although I am Sodom and I personally
think<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.610> Detroit<00:05:11.970> Red<00:05:12.150> Wings<00:05:12.210> will<00:05:12.600> beat

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
think the Detroit Red Wings will beat

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.379 
think the Detroit Red Wings will beat
the<00:05:12.900> phoenix<00:05:13.229> coyotes<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.650> six<00:05:14.040> games<00:05:14.340> why<00:05:15.330> do

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
the phoenix coyotes in six games why do

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.969 
the phoenix coyotes in six games why do
I<00:05:15.540> think<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:15.810> wall<00:05:16.169> because<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.710> Detroit

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
I think this wall because the Detroit

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.530 
I think this wall because the Detroit
Red<00:05:17.250> Wings<00:05:17.310> have<00:05:17.699> pretty<00:05:18.000> much<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.389> best

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
Red Wings have pretty much the best

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.260 
Red Wings have pretty much the best
playoff<00:05:18.900> experience<00:05:19.199> as<00:05:19.889> anybody<00:05:20.790> probably

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
playoff experience as anybody probably

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.560 
playoff experience as anybody probably
in<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.479> league<00:05:21.780> over<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.650> last<00:05:22.710> ten<00:05:23.040> years

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
in this league over the last ten years

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.969 
in this league over the last ten years
the<00:05:24.570> reason<00:05:24.810> why<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:24.960> think<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.410> coyotes<00:05:25.860> will

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
the reason why I think that coyotes will

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.260 
the reason why I think that coyotes will
actually<00:05:26.250> went<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> couple<00:05:26.550> games<00:05:26.760> is<00:05:27.030> because

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
actually went a couple games is because

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.150 
actually went a couple games is because
the<00:05:27.389> Coyotes<00:05:27.840> have<00:05:28.050> been<00:05:28.169> red-hot<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:28.919> year

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160
