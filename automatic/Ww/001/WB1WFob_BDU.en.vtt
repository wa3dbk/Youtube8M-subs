section<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> time<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.800> if<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.160> goes

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
well which I think that I can't see how

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
well which I think that I can't see how
flawless<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.320> mean<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.920> looks<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.129> nice

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
flawless is I mean it looks really nice

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I was like that's the I don't know if it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.349

that's<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> towing<00:01:02.969> home<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.300> believe

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
that's more of a towing home I believe
that<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.439> where

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that was put there for and that's where

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
that was put there for and that's where
I<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> rust<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> rush<00:01:06.720> down

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I see a lot of rust out or a rush down

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
I see a lot of rust out or a rush down
the<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.170> side<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:08.220> bad<00:01:08.400> spot<00:01:08.580> cos<00:01:08.880> stuff

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the other side really bad spot cos stuff

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
the other side really bad spot cos stuff
just<00:01:09.180> gets<00:01:09.750> kicked<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.310> they

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
just gets kicked up in there I know they

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.500 
just gets kicked up in there I know they
make<00:01:11.670> plugs<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
make plugs for that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
make plugs for that
so<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> actually<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.619> consider<00:01:14.070> doing<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so I actually will consider doing that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.870 
so I actually will consider doing that
once<00:01:14.670> once<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.159> pew<00:01:17.159> ar-15<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.640> then

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
once once this is all pew ar-15 and then

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
once once this is all pew ar-15 and then
Eastwood<00:01:18.810> also<00:01:19.020> makes<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
Eastwood also makes I don't know the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.140 
Eastwood also makes I don't know the
name<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.189> once<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.790> far<00:01:21.030> I'll

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
name of it but once I get that far I'll

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
name of it but once I get that far I'll
start<00:01:21.450> looking<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.780> where<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> stick<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
start looking up where you can stick a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.969 
start looking up where you can stick a
hose<00:01:23.400> inside<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.350> hose<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> cannon

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
hose inside like a hose for the cannon

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
hose inside like a hose for the cannon
get<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> hole<00:01:26.729> inside<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.210> coat<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
get to the hole inside and coat the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
get to the hole inside and coat the
inside<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> stuff<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.670> made

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
inside with a stuff that's made

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
inside with a stuff that's made
specifically<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.840> pretty

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
specifically for that so that's pretty

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
specifically for that so that's pretty
awesome<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
awesome and then I would think about it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.380 
awesome and then I would think about it
out<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.729> plug<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> can

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
out getting that plug because you can

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
out getting that plug because you can
see<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> starting<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> crumble<00:01:34.829> away

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
see it was starting to crumble away

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.819 
see it was starting to crumble away
there<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.439> yeah<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
there and that's not good and yeah I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.990 
there and that's not good and yeah I
start<00:01:38.100> getting<00:01:38.310> areas<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.880> I'm

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
start getting areas like this I'm

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
start getting areas like this I'm
probably<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.350> was<00:01:40.500> kind

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
probably just gonna well this was kind

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.810 
probably just gonna well this was kind
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> werster<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.729> right

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
of the the werster was kind of right

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
of the the werster was kind of right
here<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.090> glad<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> right<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.140> but

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here I'm glad I got that right now but

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
here I'm glad I got that right now but
then<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.970> further<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> front<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
then the further the front get it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.380 
then the further the front get it
actually<00:01:46.170> looks<00:01:46.409> better<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> back

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
actually looks better it's in the back

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
actually looks better it's in the back
around<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.600> isn't<00:01:48.720> too<00:01:48.899> bad<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.259> uh<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
around here isn't too bad it's uh like

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.590 
around here isn't too bad it's uh like
right<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.090> probably<00:01:51.360> gonna

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
right about there that's probably gonna

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.850 
right about there that's probably gonna
be<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> next<00:01:51.990> place<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.259> wanna<00:01:52.409> hit<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.649> both

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
be the next place I wanna hit on both

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
be the next place I wanna hit on both
sides<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> hit<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
sides that's where I'm gonna hit it and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
sides that's where I'm gonna hit it and
on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.219> -<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> come<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
on the other side - it's a come in the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
on the other side - it's a come in the
same<00:01:57.990> area<00:01:58.290> right<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.740> could<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.280> use

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
same area right here it could could use

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.429 
same area right here it could could use
it<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> there's<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.600> bad<00:02:00.810> patch<00:02:01.110> for

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it and there's a really bad patch for

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.480 
it and there's a really bad patch for
this<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> either<00:02:01.799> side<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.189> know<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.950 
this on either side I don't know what to
do<00:02:02.549> about<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.909> maybe<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.299> coat<00:02:03.509> over<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
do about that maybe just coat over it
