00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.950
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 I'm here to take a review today 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.500
 of little english books but I 'm 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 starting now to come back with this mine 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.269
 reading addiction you have seen but 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.750
 it would be great, very good, then I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.880
 I came to make the book review the selection 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 I liked the photo on instagram and the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.890
 staff asked to do a review 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.559
 his 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.050
 actually I met him on the internet 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.239
 or researching books to read and see what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 the normal staff and recommending 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.399
 truth is a technology it is followed 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.329
 for what was home and is the publisher's 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 next is a youth literature 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 she tells in first person who the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 main character that america 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.699
 singer or the goal is to achieve do not know can 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.710
 be both 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.879
 It happens at a very very time. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 far from here 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.700
 in fact it happened already the fourth 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.320
 world war and the United States is not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 more united states in the third war 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.170
 world and the victory only the units of the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.070
 China and in the fourth world war it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.729
 It makes it that's where this do this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 book 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.159
 so it's actually north territory 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.900
 american without being united anymore 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 with the wars to take place and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.570
 appearance of a new one there in fact all 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.939
 the planet is reshaped and reads 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.010
 she becomes a monarchy again and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.000
 consequently this 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.970
 queens rule the country there is 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 from that moment they begin to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.770
 have monarchy again 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.880
 begins to dispute the heart of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.680
 princes and then the fact of the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.410
 selection is nothing more than the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.170
 choice of 35 girls to play for 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.170
 engagement ring with the prince and Mercian 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.730
 among them is America if the selection 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.200
 is not available for all 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.990
 girls in the country who are over 16 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.750
 I'm not mistaken or 17 and a 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 letter for them for she is 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.180
 not all the girls are 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.910
 apply but there are means that there 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.550
 they end up offering her so that she can 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.000
 candidate who is money so if your 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.250
 daughter outside is not the princess's 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.870
 selection you 're just food to win one 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.170
 check per week 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.870
 the emergence of this time in the country is that 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
 actually does not have a date is not 2001 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.260
 both have no specific date in the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.520
 is also a division of the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.440
 home population 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.880
 houses is nothing more than nothing else 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.350
 that society divided into classes 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.000
 there is from 11 to 8 in the book and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.880
 one would be 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.210
 would be the kings in the monarchy itself and 18 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.500
 would be a plebeian and even starved 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.620
 then America is from Hunt 5 and she is 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.790
 selected to participate in the selection is 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 given 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.420
 the plot he goes with 35 girls going 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.130
 pro castle recalls the palace and 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.890
 disputing the meetings with the prince 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:30.020
 maxson that is not really a dispute 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 and they are there they sleep there they stay 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.489
 months inside the castle and the prince 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.890
 MÃ©rcio organizes meetings with 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.930
 and she and they will also 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.130
 interacting with each other knowing 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.320
 little of the life that possibly one will have 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.870
 so the selection logo is it goes 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.600
 eliminating girls until they stay 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.790
 the elite group that is the second book that 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.580
 it's only six girls who go 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.459
 remain there in the palace until then 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.080
 spent several months and America continues 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.940
 there is selected for this group when 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.090
 same time america is 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 disputing the heart of the prince nexus 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 she already had an unconditional love of the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.290
 years 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.160
 secretly because this new country he 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.430
 It 's full of rules, a touch of 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.769
 enough 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.060
 What happened that changed this country 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.729
 Then she dates the aster he 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.340
 truth is of the 6l caste below the house 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.270
 and this would in fact not be 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.750
 forbidden but not very fond of 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.750
 could women marry men 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.100
 more superior caste but could not 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.440
 marry you 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.270
 walked marrying men of chestnut 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.450
 contained in the explanation package 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.700
 even given the story happens i will 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.830
 Give my opinion I loved this book 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.230
 I find it very exciting organized 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.720
 I cried here in anger and I think he 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.050
 It's really cool, actually, so I have it. 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.130
 a 17 year old as author of the band 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.560
 said foot 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.440
 so I found it very very exciting 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.610
 He is very young and very easy to read. 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.030
 calmly read the pages that the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.160
 letters are well passed to 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.310
 who wants to start reading who wants to come back 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.360
 It's for those who have lost their reading 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.710
 Great because you get excited over there. 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.630
 it three days 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.960
 It's very cool of people who read to a 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.510
 day it has 357 pages 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.030
 so it's not too big because even the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.540
 the letters they are spaced 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.400
 paragraphs well loaded to read and I 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.170
 I think it 's super cool if you're 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.630
 looking for a book he is quite cheap 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.730

 Juvenile romance disputes it is over or 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.480
 less a version of voracious games 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.970
