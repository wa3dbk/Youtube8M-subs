00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.309
 they will never look each other in the eye Francesco Pianeta Rheinmetall 96 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 big of us annoying to the finish with 1 78 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.099
 actually a clear advantage for the one meter 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.650
 But the market seems to be at a loss if it does not have the services at all 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.009
 Legs hard to hit it could be 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.410
 Actually Botox is a great game 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.300
 probably 7 4 liters 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.450
 has not yet gone over such a dance 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.450
 in his speech still young professional career 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.750
 with the attempt to defy 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.490
 the disadvantages 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.820
 to dissolve in range 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.900
 Copenhagen 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.620
 is going to try a house a lot with the time-tested Sven Petke tactics 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.370
 move 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.490
 and the location like Sven Ottke from the super middleweight two years ago 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.700
 what's the 76 kilos on the scales now almost a hundred 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 RTL is looking for a powerful upgrade 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 40 Drink calls therefore the patient 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.490
 but despite this size difference Skippy some serious 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.000
 opponent 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.650
 Bregenz with a long before yelling amateur losers 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 three times national champion 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.720
 after all, as a professional boxer North American champions in the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.030
 Light Heavyweight 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 even the city already with some what do you have the people in the under 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.000
 other with the officiating 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 World Champion in super middleweight with Lucian Bute them 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 the rescuers try to control representatives 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.869
 Wow 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.259
 Referee Daniel van der Wiele 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 thanks so far rather relaxed watching 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.049
 the AnyDoc in the legal release 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.929
 we must try to come to work late with the long 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.929
 90, by the way, at a distance 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.519
 No comes these surprising attacks equal to three four walls 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.059
 then the cover must stand at four meters 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.579
 Royals very good 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.879
 the start is done by d writer as a Predator 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.199
 also comes as no surprise because the comes from the lower limit 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.980
 So who's the press council left uppercut zombie meter 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.439
 and also with the real Gerke 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.079
 the tempo has to increase a bit to make sure of this round 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.639
 value 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.639
 gorgeous for the investors 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.869
 but also Dr 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:34.219
 by Uwe Klemens 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.389
 This is so far very difficult 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.009
 the distance to zero 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.009
 that is very bitter 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.119
 in the context of a 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 MR 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.999
 the newspaper continues 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:01.909
 11 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.909
 from the age ago 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.579
 be locked again and again 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.719
 there does 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.610
 Narrenrat Sarrazin 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.979
 at the age of 23 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.629
 Brambauer dances her and the heavyweight and has a lot to do 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.629
 Gain experience and legal affairs 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.050
 Giving Axel Troost new courage to build Eggesin would have given the will 

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:47.990
 slower 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.189
 that could be the opportunity 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.840
 also for the left 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 Schneidhain proposal 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.599
 but now it needs both floors coverage 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.990
 around these fast straights hands 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.070
 big bells intercept Jackie white 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.349
 nothing in itself 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.349
 how artists move 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.499
 with the swastika head 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.360
 technically very well trained has certainly advantages 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.360
 against Troicki, who had only a short amateur career 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 No help 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.759
 born in Calabria in the same village 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.919
 Italy's World Champion China Power to Do so 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.639
 it is already there 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.219
 At the age of six he came to Germany 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.219
 Son of a craftsman 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.419
 but he wants his bread 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.740
 that's very nice Maike Wieger's insight into the finish 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.200
 the rule sets for adults 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.689
 with the right one 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.069
 to prepare the action
