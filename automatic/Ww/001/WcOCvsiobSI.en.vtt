00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
can move it around and such and he's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.300 
can move it around and such and he's
supposed<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:50.010> follow<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.720> again<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:53.040> at

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
supposed to follow and again like at

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.870 
supposed to follow and again like at
first<00:02:53.640> he<00:02:54.360> can't<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:55.140> follow<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.770> but<00:02:56.580> then

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
first he can't really follow it but then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.740 
first he can't really follow it but then
as<00:02:57.330> he<00:02:58.260> gets<00:02:58.470> better<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.040> trains<00:02:59.400> more<00:02:59.730> he<00:03:00.570> can

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
as he gets better and trains more he can

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.960 
as he gets better and trains more he can
