00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.659
 There's something new on the road. 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.980
 neighbor of bmw 530 ie9 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.079
 do not know 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 the clubs were kicked out 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.419
 for some it has also reminded others now seems to be ready to give the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.450
 boat 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.000
 important thing was that it imposes 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 why the factory that is 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 if they have been thrown on the street 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 This causes strangeness 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.530
 the new model of all the luxury items the larger brothers the c3 of class 7 by 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.249
 example 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:56.080
 go for it 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 the on-board computer of the brand 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 since then the cost of reducing too much weight 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.820
 on grass 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.340
 the new 530 was 75 kilos lighter than the previous generation 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.860
 result of the use of aluminum from the suspension on part of the body 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.730
 lots of power 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.860
 ah are from dirt roads is a comfort show 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.520
 the video technology with the driver the job of driving for the first time in the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.830
 story the car leaves factory with active steering 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.630
 the car is stationary just turn the wheel slightly the character is a 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 City 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.570
 movement is the opposite for a more pronounced curve 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.420
 it's needed 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.319
 give several turns on the steering wheel 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.040
 it is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.569
 prevents the car jerked abruptly 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.579
 by this value speed in other words is more security for the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.270
 occupants 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.320
 if the car started to penalty for now the direction wanted to correct the 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.810
 trajectory alone 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 he is great that he would realize the situation 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.299
 is that the steering system activates the information of the sensors installed in 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.749
 several points of the car 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.529
 be in this animation 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.169
 a car crossing the road with a lorry is normal a slight detour of route 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.510
 with 1 530 and that this does not happen the sensors send this data to the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.760
 board computer that can combine everything and decide what should be done by 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 fractions of seconds 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.500
 focus on the landscape tranquility green hill the head forgets a little 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.849
 technology and thinking about the cost of this car which is in the same 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.340
 competitors audi a6 4 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.500
 already test the mercedes team and 320 295 thousand reais for a car that the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.849
 cement factory with its business class is not the most 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 all but it's far from sexy 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.009
 So 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.599
 the future he debuted
