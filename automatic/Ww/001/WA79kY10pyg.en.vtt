tricks I want to show you trick number

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
tricks I want to show you trick number
one<00:00:31.140> we've<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.430> oleander<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.480> pot

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one we've got this oleander in a pot

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
one we've got this oleander in a pot
here<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> pretty<00:00:34.680> big<00:00:34.950> container

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
here so this is a pretty big container

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
here so this is a pretty big container
so<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> base<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> only<00:00:36.630> ender<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> have

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
so at the base of the only ender we have

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
so at the base of the only ender we have
tomatoes<00:00:37.890> we've<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.370> cucumber<00:00:38.969> we've<00:00:39.090> even

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
tomatoes we've got cucumber we've even

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.330 
tomatoes we've got cucumber we've even
got<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.450> petunias<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.469> annuals<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
got some petunias some other annuals and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.660 
got some petunias some other annuals and
in<00:00:41.850> general<00:00:42.390> why<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.739> twofold<00:00:44.219> one

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in general why I do this is twofold one

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
in general why I do this is twofold one
is<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> add<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.379> couple<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> vegetables

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is I like to add a couple of vegetables

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
is I like to add a couple of vegetables
in<00:00:47.340> weird<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.879> places<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> tomatoes

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
in weird little places so the tomatoes

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
in weird little places so the tomatoes
will<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.410> fall<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> edge<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
will actually fall over the edge of this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.340 
will actually fall over the edge of this
but<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.420> thing<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:51.960> act<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but the other thing is these act like

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
but the other thing is these act like
little<00:00:52.590> watering<00:00:52.949> cues<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.329> when

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
little watering cues to me because when

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.439 
little watering cues to me because when
the<00:00:54.780> vegetables<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.219> annuals<00:00:56.969> begin<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the vegetables and the annuals begin to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930 
the vegetables and the annuals begin to
droop<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.260> tells<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.070> topsoil<00:00:59.640> has

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
droop that tells me that the topsoil has

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
droop that tells me that the topsoil has
dried<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> topsoil

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
dried out so if I keep the topsoil

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
dried out so if I keep the topsoil
fairly<00:01:02.850> moist<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> oleander

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
fairly moist I know that the oleander

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
fairly moist I know that the oleander
will<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.100> enough<00:01:05.339> water<00:01:05.610> sometimes<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> grow

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
will have enough water sometimes I grow

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
will have enough water sometimes I grow
herbs<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> containers<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.250> fennel

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
herbs and containers as well like fennel

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
herbs and containers as well like fennel
so<00:01:09.180> here's<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> fennel<00:01:10.229> which

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so here's a little bit of fennel which

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
so here's a little bit of fennel which
we've<00:01:10.650> grown<00:01:10.830> into<00:01:11.010> container<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
we've grown into container and if you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.490 
we've grown into container and if you
look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.020> tell<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
look at it you can tell that it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
look at it you can tell that it's
beginning<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> droop<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.030> couple<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
beginning to droop so a couple of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
beginning to droop so a couple of
indicators<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> water<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
indicators on when to water one the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
indicators on when to water one the
plant<00:01:18.420> begins<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.020> droop<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
plant begins to droop a little bit and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
plant begins to droop a little bit and
you<00:01:20.759> look<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> say<00:01:21.780> well<00:01:22.080> drooping

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you look at it and you say well drooping

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
you look at it and you say well drooping
can<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.799> over<00:01:23.159> watering<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:23.759> under<00:01:24.119> watering

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
can be over watering or under watering

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
can be over watering or under watering
the<00:01:24.720> soils<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.140> dry<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:26.070> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the soils very dry so we know this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.410 
the soils very dry so we know this
definitely<00:01:26.610> needs<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> water

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
definitely needs a little bit of water

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
definitely needs a little bit of water
the<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.829> tell<00:01:29.280> before<00:01:30.090> things<00:01:30.390> droop

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the other way I tell before things droop

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
the other way I tell before things droop
is<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.930> lift<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.650> sort<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> mental

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is I lift them and sort of get a mental

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
is I lift them and sort of get a mental
note<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.630> heavy<00:01:34.020> everything<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
note of how heavy everything is so this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700 
note of how heavy everything is so this
pot<00:01:35.759> has<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.360> gotten<00:01:36.630> lighter<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
pot has actually gotten lighter and that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
pot has actually gotten lighter and that
indicates<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> me<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> water<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.659> dried

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
indicates to me that the water has dried

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.990 
indicates to me that the water has dried
out<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.470> pots<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.159> lighter<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.850> we're

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
out the pots a little lighter so we're

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.109 
out the pots a little lighter so we're
just<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> give<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.960> drink

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
just going to give it a little drink

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
just going to give it a little drink
it's<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.649> let<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> herbs<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it's much better to let the herbs and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.399 
it's much better to let the herbs and
the<00:01:47.820> leafy<00:01:48.119> greens<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the leafy greens get a little bit on the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
the leafy greens get a little bit on the
dry<00:01:49.560> side<00:01:50.009> before<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.939> water<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.390> rather

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
dry side before you water them rather

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
dry side before you water them rather
than<00:01:52.140> keep<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.590> wet<00:01:52.829> by<00:01:53.280> letting<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.700> dry

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
than keep them wet by letting them dry

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.280 
than keep them wet by letting them dry
out<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> create<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> much

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
out a little bit you create a much

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
out a little bit you create a much
stronger<00:01:55.680> root<00:01:56.040> system<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> between

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
stronger root system in between

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.200 
stronger root system in between
waterings<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.340> I've<00:01:59.460> tried<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.030> today

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
is to give you some indicators on when

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
is to give you some indicators on when
to<00:02:02.490> water<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.090> again<00:02:03.420> here's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:04.049> area

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to water so again here's a little area

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
to water so again here's a little area
of<00:02:04.590> herbs<00:02:04.890> we've<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.520> dill<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.729> some

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
we're going to water them and that's

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.740 
we're going to water them and that's

what that has done is it let the plant

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.020 
what that has done is it let the plant
dry<00:02:17.590> out<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.100> root<00:02:18.280> systems<00:02:18.640> gotten<00:02:18.910> very

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
dry out the root systems gotten very

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.330 
dry out the root systems gotten very
strong<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.230> plants<00:02:20.530> continued<00:02:20.950> one
