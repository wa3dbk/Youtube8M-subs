Hi guys,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.960
Today I'm gonna be doing a red carpet
inspired elegant up-do hair tutorial.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.120
This is a really cool--it almost looks
like a back bun,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.480
but it's more of an up-do,
but it's really straightforward,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.880
and so much easier than
it actually looks to do.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.880
So all you're gonna need
is a hairbrush to smooth the hair,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
a hairband,
and a small hair elastic

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.160
and then lots of bobby pins
to pin it all up.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.240
So I'm gonna start off with just
brushing all my hair back.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.040
And then I'm just gonna gather it all up
into a mid ponytail.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720
So I'm not gonna do this too high up
for my hair,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920
I'm just kinda gonna go
in the middle of my hair.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280
So then I'm gonna take
my small hair elastic

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.960
and bring the ponytail forward
over the top of my head

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.280
and tie it off at the bottom like this.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.960
And now we're gonna bring up
the ponytail again,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
and we're gonna put
the end underneath,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.160
and I'm gonna just pin them under.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
So I'm just gonna take some bobby pins
and pin that in place,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.240
so just pin it to the head,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.120
so that they're kind of hidden away
under the hair.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.680
And then I'm gonna bring
the ponytail up

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.560
so that it kind of covers
all those ends,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.680
and now I'm just gonna
put a load of bobby pins in

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.000
just to pin it in place.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.760
So now I'm just gonna finish it off
with some hairspray.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.400
