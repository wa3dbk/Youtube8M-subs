go into a different bin styrofoam is

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.830 
go into a different bin styrofoam is
never<00:02:02.979> recycled<00:02:03.490> on<00:02:03.579> campus<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:04.149> therefore

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
never recycled on campus and therefore

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.910

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
reason that we throw away the lid and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.059 
reason that we throw away the lid and
the<00:02:18.270> straw<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> landfill<00:02:19.260> stream<00:02:19.590> is

the straw in the landfill stream is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.520 
the straw in the landfill stream is
because<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.819> recyclables<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.930> sorted

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
because the recyclables are sorted

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.740 
because the recyclables are sorted
mechanically<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.700> these<00:02:23.910> items<00:02:24.060> are<00:02:24.420> simply

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
mechanically and these items are simply

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.540 
mechanically and these items are simply
too<00:02:24.989> small<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.709> recovered<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
too small to be recovered in that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.809 
too small to be recovered in that
process<00:02:28.099> finally<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.120> waxed<00:02:30.959> paper<00:02:31.050> cup

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.400 
process finally I have a waxed paper cup
waxed<00:02:32.819> paper<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:33.420> go<00:02:33.540> into<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.870> compost<00:02:34.260> bin

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
waxed paper can go into the compost bin

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.699 
waxed paper can go into the compost bin
so<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.340> compost<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.090> cup<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.540> trash<00:02:37.260> the

have a really strong culture of

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.520 
have a really strong culture of
sustainability<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.900> fact<00:04:37.139> that<00:04:37.260> there

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
sustainability and the fact that there

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.250 
sustainability and the fact that there
are<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.040> many<00:04:38.100> different<00:04:38.639> goals<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:40.020> not

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
are so many different goals it's not

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.010 
are so many different goals it's not
just<00:04:40.530> about<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:42.180> four<00:04:42.389> years<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.720> you're

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
just about the four years that you're

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.990 
just about the four years that you're
here<00:04:43.350> at<00:04:43.560> school<00:04:43.889> it's<00:04:44.460> about<00:04:44.610> making<00:04:44.820> sure

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
here at school it's about making sure

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.080 
here at school it's about making sure
that<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.450> carries<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:46.050> beyond<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.220> for<00:04:48.000> me

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that it carries on beyond that so for me

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.879 
that it carries on beyond that so for me
it<00:04:48.210> makes<00:04:48.360> sense<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.690> I'm<00:04:49.110> doing<00:04:49.470> my<00:04:49.620> part

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
it makes sense that I'm doing my part

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.890 
it makes sense that I'm doing my part
and<00:04:50.310> trying<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.820> compost<00:04:51.240> even<00:04:51.540> if<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and trying to compost even if it's a

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.750 
and trying to compost even if it's a
small<00:04:52.169> amount<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.710> know<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.100> all<00:04:53.220> together<00:04:53.400> it

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
small amount I know that all together it

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.670 
small amount I know that all together it
adds<00:04:53.910> up<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.450> something<00:04:54.660> more<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.230> that's

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
adds up to be something more and that's

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.070 
adds up to be something more and that's
important<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.220> me<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.460> be<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> part<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.080> this

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
important to me to be a part of this
