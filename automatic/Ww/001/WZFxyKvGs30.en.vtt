00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 the purpose of this video today is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 simply to show you how 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.130
 install the dish on android store 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 your blackberry to have all the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.070
 applications that you can install 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 or uninstall very very easily 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.250
 so I start directly where it takes 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.439
 go to settings 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.539
 then you go into security 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.010
 confidentiality 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.810
 that's very simple you go down while 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910
 down you go into the mode 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 development 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 so it's pretty big if I've grown 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 the screen the writes for although this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.730
 either via the camera so the mode 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.030
 development it must be activated 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 that you are wondering a password I 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.430
 attack me at 3.04 ok so that tells you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.320
 like whatever the activated concept and that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 his experts in ten days very well there 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 you have your ip address what it takes 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 do for the suite directly you 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
 return to your cable that is provided 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 with the phone so directly 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 phone and a computer 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.170
 that will ask you to install the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 blackberry's own software you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 just install it like that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 will there be the driver in my computer from 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.909
 phone in your workstation 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 you click on the small logo 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.439
 blackberry that will be displayed and it's going 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.450
 launch the application the installation without 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.290
 problem then what to do 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.479
 you download google chrome so the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.020
 google chrome internet browser 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.710
 once it's installed you'll launch 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.770
 internet and you type baby 10 slash and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.869
 tip caps manager even if you type that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 playbook apps manager my opinion you 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.770
 find you download the extension 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.530
 for google chrome 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.479
 so it will be displayed exactly the same 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.920
 you add google chrome and you go 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.460
 in fact after you are going to have the little 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 logo here a little blackberry logo a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 Once that's done you go 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.409
 click on it 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.750
 once you click on it there 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:16.800
 which will open this page this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.160
 page there you directly enter your 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.100
 success and we find on the mode 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.800
 development therefore without 169 254 0.11 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:36.120
 here you are typing here very precisely 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.940
 then you save it and you 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.489
 just click down so once that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.850
 these backups leave your ip address 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.680

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.330
 will die a second page normally 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.280
 would have to die a page where it's me 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.280
 ask for my ID 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.310

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.370
 conducted directly on this page good 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.010
 this is one very complicated then you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.010
 arrive on this dashboard what 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.840

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.830
 go on this web page so snap 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.870
 so this is this application all 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.190
 simply as a brand and you can 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.310
 and directly from the dishes in my 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 downloads so snap 2.0.0 a brief 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.450
 you see well at his game louvre a 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 once it's open 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.849
 it automatically installs right here 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.329
 so there she is loading the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.329
 compress etc 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.530
 so there successfully the installation 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.299

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.500

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:41.730
 go out of the app unplug it and 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.730
