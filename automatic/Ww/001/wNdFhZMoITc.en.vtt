00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
hey there i'm josh clark and this is the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.740 
hey there i'm josh clark and this is the
brain<00:00:11.309> stuff<00:00:11.610> where<00:00:11.670> i<00:00:11.880> explain<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
brain stuff where i explain to you a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
brain stuff where i explain to you a
little<00:00:12.960> bit<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.440> diesel<00:00:13.860> submarines<00:00:14.429> now<00:00:14.880> i

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
little bit about diesel submarines now i

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.760 
little bit about diesel submarines now i
know<00:00:15.089> you're<00:00:15.570> out<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:15.960> walking<00:00:16.500> around

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
know you're out there walking around

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.040 
know you're out there walking around
thinking<00:00:17.279> everything's<00:00:18.150> hunky-dory<00:00:18.660> with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
thinking everything's hunky-dory with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
thinking everything's hunky-dory with
our<00:00:19.230> submarine<00:00:19.710> fleet<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.490> live<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
our submarine fleet if you live in a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.660 
our submarine fleet if you live in a
country<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> navy<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.740> did<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.430> know

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
country that has a navy but did you know

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.170 
country that has a navy but did you know
that<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> war<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.010> between<00:00:26.340> what

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that there's a war going on between what

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
that there's a war going on between what
type<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> submarine<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.289> better<00:00:28.590> yeah<00:00:29.400> follow

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
type of submarine is better yeah follow

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
type of submarine is better yeah follow
me<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.420> diesel<00:00:31.019> submarines<00:00:31.439> are

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
me with this diesel submarines are

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
me with this diesel submarines are
pretty<00:00:31.800> prevalent<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.520> across<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.090> world

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
pretty prevalent all across the world

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.560 
pretty prevalent all across the world
but<00:00:34.170> here's<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> spit-take<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.360> air

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but here's the spit-take they need air

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.110 
but here's the spit-take they need air
to<00:00:36.899> function<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.160> diesel<00:00:41.640> submarines

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to function so how do diesel submarines

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
to function so how do diesel submarines
work<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.870> need<00:00:43.079> air<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
work if they need air but as is the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
work if they need air but as is the
common<00:00:45.480> characteristic<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> submarines

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
common characteristic of submarines

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
common characteristic of submarines
everywhere<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.610> need<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> stay<00:00:48.180> underwater

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
everywhere they need to stay underwater

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.990 
everywhere they need to stay underwater
for<00:00:48.960> prolonged<00:00:49.320> periods<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> time<00:00:49.860> here's<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
for prolonged periods of time here's the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
for prolonged periods of time here's the
answer<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.020> obvious<00:00:52.199> you're<00:00:52.530> going

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
answer and it's so obvious you're going

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.189 
answer and it's so obvious you're going
to<00:00:52.739> feel<00:00:52.949> silly<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.579> thinking<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
to feel silly for not thinking of it

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
to feel silly for not thinking of it

is<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> sub<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
is if you are on a sub and you have the

knows<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.420> easier<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.500> see

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
knows it's way easier when you can see

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
knows it's way easier when you can see
where<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> submarine<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.299> I'm

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
where the submarine is you know what I'm

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so to solve this problem people came up

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
so to solve this problem people came up
with<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> nuclear<00:01:42.990> submarine<00:01:43.560> the

on oxygen for combustion like a diesel
engine<00:01:48.840> does<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.530> means<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.189> stay

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
engine does which means it can stay

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
engine does which means it can stay
submerged<00:01:50.670> indefinitely<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.500> least<00:01:52.680> until

the problem is with nuclear subs even
though<00:01:57.869> they're<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.200> faster<00:01:58.680> than<00:01:58.710> diesel

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
though they're way faster than diesel

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
though they're way faster than diesel
submarines<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.450> they're<00:02:00.630> more

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
submarines is that they're more

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
submarines is that they're more
expensive<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.159> buy<00:02:02.310> something<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.820> 2

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
expensive you can buy something like 2

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.980 
expensive you can buy something like 2
to<00:02:04.409> 4<00:02:04.770> diesel<00:02:05.430> subs<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> price<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.719> one

and<00:02:08.729> they're<00:02:09.729> also<00:02:09.970> louder<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.890> keep

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
and they're also louder you have to keep

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.190 
and they're also louder you have to keep
