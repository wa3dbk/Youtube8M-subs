00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Tell me guys, I'm Daniel Fonseca. 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.299
 guitarist of the band return 33 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.090
 I 'm here to tell you guys. 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.940
 my pedals in my setup you're using 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 Actually, my guitar is my anp. 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.619
 so I'll start with the guitar that is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 this piv model predator 7 strings of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 guitar I get has more or 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.230
 At least a year I enjoyed it very difficult. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550
 the advantages in this stage for all types 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 Sound I Make I Can Take Away 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 any timbre with her made a change 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.760
 that I changed the pickup the bridge has a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.430
 design of the week the brand was able to take 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 a very cool team with her and the next 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.829
 that I want to talk about my qs ranking 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.300
 meteor mg-30 beside being a player 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.920
 very good 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 besides being light it is easy to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 you can get a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 Very cool timbre anywhere with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.879
 He and I want to talk to you, too. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 my pedals 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.170
 Let's start with my home in the United 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.210
 simple and basic but as soon as 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.729
 sound really cool and I made a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.930
 change in it as you can 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.500
 I noticed I put a led to indicate 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.119
 when there there be off because 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 many a time we end up 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 confusing 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 When will you remember the pedal and forget it? 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 What do you do when you live there? 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.600
 The way you will perceive the attack 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.400
 on you have to take it all back on 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.360
 then led I put he's 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 switched on 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 the toll is off turned off the light 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:51.000
 pedal is working next pedal is the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 my kraft cross tuner works 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 very well because I use it is a pedal 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.439
 and another pedal is the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.259
 My baby for an excellent criminal a pedal 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.689
 that I do not have in my setup 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.000
 change pedal setup exe want to have 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.649
 with me 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.069
 other data also do not say my 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.420
 mxr made 90 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.810
 the classic among all guitarists 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.639
 a very nice pedal with a very good sound 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.370
 cool and also has the superchip ps 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:28.010
 five of the voice I use it in the function 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.290
 love most of the time sometimes 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.950
 use to make a guitar fold but 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.260
 very rare and another criminal that this 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.169
 Totally handmade boutique piece 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.419
 valved pipe that is there are three stations 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.480
 2 x 7 valves 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:48.230
 he is a pre it simulates the building the mark 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.010
 2 of the table is a pre you get 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 to take real sound from an amplifier and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.719
 99% of the new cd of the return band was 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.549
 recorded with this pedal 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.010
 it has some nice functions that 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.859
 all of which nine of them are the types 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.469
 then you can have two tones of 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.069
 heavier anyone else to a timbre 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:12.530
 more classic blues next pedal is 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.150
 My league booster is a pedal. 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.560
 Also, I think it's cool not to 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 and stop doing the delay of the alloy and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.000
 also that I was able to take a 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.139
 repetition so I short one 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.090
 Really cool replay 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.189
 so I'll show you guys quickly 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.180
 a bit of the sound of expecting more 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.180
 let's start at the the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.340
 and there we go by pound the anp on a drive 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.340

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:19.459
 there we have my super shift use in the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:23.140
 most of the time the name that my 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.140
 simulator on the shaft 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.669
 It is with law 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.690
 that's it 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.960

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.610
