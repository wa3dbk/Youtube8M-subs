00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.490 
them and I'm only other thing I'm going
to<00:01:30.150> add<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.049> bit<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> red<00:01:31.470> onion

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to add is just a little bit of red onion

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
to add is just a little bit of red onion
so<00:01:32.189> here's<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.579> we're<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.060> my

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so here's what we're going to do my

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380 
so here's what we're going to do my
skillets<00:01:34.020> hot<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> put<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
skillets hot I'm going to put in just a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.039 
skillets hot I'm going to put in just a
drizzle<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.320> olive<00:01:37.470> oil<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.810> I'm<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
drizzle of olive oil and I'm going to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
drizzle of olive oil and I'm going to
cook<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> stems<00:01:40.860> first<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> reason<00:01:41.850> I'm

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
cook the stems first and the reason I'm

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050 
cook the stems first and the reason I'm
doing<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.159> stems<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.759> more

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
doing that is because the stems are more

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.719 
doing that is because the stems are more
tough<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> wanted<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> start<00:01:47.070> sauteing

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
tough so I wanted to start sauteing

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.690 
tough so I wanted to start sauteing
those<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.180> soften<00:01:48.479> them

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
those to soften them

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.790 
those to soften them
along<00:01:51.700> with<00:01:51.820> my<00:01:52.000> red<00:01:52.240> onions<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.470> I'm<00:01:56.590> just

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
along with my red onions so I'm just

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.500 
along with my red onions so I'm just
going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.040> stir<00:01:57.340> these<00:01:57.550> for<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> few<00:01:58.150> minutes

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
going to stir these for a few minutes

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.510 
going to stir these for a few minutes
before<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:59.050> add<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.380> leaves<00:01:59.800> just<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.370> that

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
before I add the leaves just so that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.840 
before I add the leaves just so that
they<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.820> time<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.270> soften<00:02:01.540> a<00:02:01.810> little<00:02:01.840> bit

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they have time to soften a little bit

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.490 
they have time to soften a little bit
but<00:02:03.850> what's<00:02:04.060> nice<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.870> add<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.380> much
