00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
dudley in the previous version in in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
dudley in the previous version in in
2012<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> smug<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.829> thought<00:00:53.010> he<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
2012 but smug actually thought he was a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880 
2012 but smug actually thought he was a
high<00:00:53.579> tier<00:00:53.910> character<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
high tier character now with all the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
high tier character now with all the
improvements<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.430> Dudley<00:00:56.699> got<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> think

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
improvements that Dudley got I think

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
improvements that Dudley got I think
smug<00:00:57.809> has<00:00:58.500> been<00:00:58.680> quoted<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> say<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.370> he's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
smug has been quoted to say like he's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
smug has been quoted to say like he's
actually<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.180> top<00:01:00.899> tier<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.410> does<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.739> he

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
actually like top tier now does he he

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
actually like top tier now does he he
thinks<00:01:02.399> yeah<00:01:02.609> yeah<00:01:03.059> he<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.390> said<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> yeah

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
thinks yeah yeah he has said that yeah

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.490 
thinks yeah yeah he has said that yeah
suddenly<00:01:04.589> stopped<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.250> right<00:01:07.700> yeah

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
suddenly stopped here now right yeah

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.960 
suddenly stopped here now right yeah
certainly<00:01:10.500> seems<00:01:10.890> good<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.460> he's<00:01:11.729> fought

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
certainly seems good and he's fought

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
certainly seems good and he's fought
died<00:01:12.150> minion<00:01:12.540> before<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.260> he<00:01:13.439> definitely<00:01:13.799> has

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
died minion before so he definitely has

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.330 
died minion before so he definitely has
some<00:01:14.280> guile<00:01:14.700> experience<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.100> we'll<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.250> if

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
some guile experience but we'll see if

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920 
some guile experience but we'll see if
it's<00:01:17.490> Kyle<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> might<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.240> exactly

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it's Kyle it might be yeah exactly

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's Kyle it might be yeah exactly
let's<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.439> he<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.830> uses<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.360> yeah

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
let's see if he actually uses that yeah

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.830 
let's see if he actually uses that yeah
now<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.780> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.970> more<00:01:23.970> crunch<00:01:24.330> time<00:01:24.600> than

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
now it's kind of more crunch time than

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
now it's kind of more crunch time than
it<00:01:24.930> might<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> been<00:01:25.350> before<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:26.189> right

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it might have been before right right

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.020 
it might have been before right right
right

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
right

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.270 
right
he<00:01:27.900> knows<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.259> he's<00:01:28.409> getting<00:01:28.710> his<00:01:28.979> yeah<00:01:34.280> but

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
he knows what he's getting his yeah but

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 
he knows what he's getting his yeah but
yeah<00:01:35.430> Dudley<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.689> his<00:01:36.900> mid-range<00:01:37.350> game<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
yeah Dudley I like his mid-range game a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
yeah Dudley I like his mid-range game a
lot<00:01:38.130> better<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.790> Stan<00:01:39.030> Faris<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> big

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
lot better now that Stan Faris is a big

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.190 
lot better now that Stan Faris is a big
improvement<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:41.630> think<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.840> said<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> best

obviously<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:51.450> absolutely

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
obviously my guys yeah absolutely

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.260 
obviously my guys yeah absolutely
absolutely

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.610 

guille<00:01:57.270> i<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.900> pretty<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.590> know

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
guille i think is pretty good you know

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.500 
guille i think is pretty good you know
he<00:01:58.830> got<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.190> nerves<00:01:59.400> he<00:01:59.580> got<00:01:59.730> some<00:01:59.940> buffs<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
he got some nerves he got some buffs the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.020 
he got some nerves he got some buffs the
game<00:02:01.380> engine<00:02:01.620> itself<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.550> kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> plays

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
game engine itself I think kind of plays

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
game engine itself I think kind of plays
into<00:02:03.240> his<00:02:03.420> hands<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.080> more<00:02:04.260> cuz

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
into his hands a little bit more cuz

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.820 
into his hands a little bit more cuz
it's<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:06.180> quite<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.570> vortex<00:02:07.050> II<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
it's not quite as vortex II it's a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's not quite as vortex II it's a
little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.130> more<00:02:08.250> ground-based<00:02:08.850> than<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> was

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
little bit more ground-based than it was

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.480 
little bit more ground-based than it was
before<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.740> more<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> should

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
before a little bit more well I should

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.220 
before a little bit more well I should
say<00:02:11.580> neutral<00:02:11.940> kind<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> standing<00:02:12.810> base<00:02:12.990> than

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
say neutral kind of standing base than

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.590 
say neutral kind of standing base than
it<00:02:13.320> was<00:02:13.410> born<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.740> certain<00:02:14.040> Brown<00:02:14.340> but

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
it was born on a certain Brown but

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.990 
it was born on a certain Brown but
you're<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.720> knocked<00:02:16.350> down<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.070> got<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> deal

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you're not knocked down and got a deal

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.699 
you're not knocked down and got a deal
with<00:02:18.090> horrible<00:02:18.330> stuff<00:02:18.600> quite<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:19.050> often<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
with horrible stuff quite as often and

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.949 
with horrible stuff quite as often and
if<00:02:20.490> that's<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> case<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.270> guile<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.780> play<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
if that's the case then guile can play a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.750 
if that's the case then guile can play a
little<00:02:22.140> bit<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.410> effectively<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.220> kind

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
little bit more effectively so it's kind

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.370 
little bit more effectively so it's kind
of<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> mixed<00:02:24.209> bag<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.420> guile<00:02:30.170> that's<00:02:31.170> up

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
start playing defense but that's just

start playing defense but that's just
not<00:06:07.930> what<00:06:08.110> knuckles<00:06:08.470> he<00:06:08.530> does<00:06:11.070> he's<00:06:12.070> going<00:06:12.250> to

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
not what knuckles he does he's going to

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.670 
not what knuckles he does he's going to
be<00:06:12.430> careful<00:06:12.820> because<00:06:12.910> smug<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.600> really<00:06:14.380> taking

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
be careful because smug is really taking

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.070 
be careful because smug is really taking
advantage<00:06:14.830> of<00:06:15.220> his<00:06:15.370> sonic<00:06:15.670> boom<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.450> think<00:06:16.990> he

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
advantage of his sonic boom I think he

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.600 
advantage of his sonic boom I think he
needs<00:06:17.290> a<00:06:17.380> chill<00:06:17.650> on<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.920> sonic<00:06:18.250> boom<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.580> little

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
needs a chill on the sonic boom a little
