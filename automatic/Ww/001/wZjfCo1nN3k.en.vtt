bother me as much and then maybe he can
realize<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.430> power<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.970> partial<00:02:23.390> rep<00:02:23.540> ranges

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
realize the power of partial rep ranges

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.510 
realize the power of partial rep ranges
to<00:02:24.440> get<00:02:24.680> through<00:02:24.830> sticking<00:02:25.160> points<00:02:25.430> in

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
to get through sticking points in

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.100 
to get through sticking points in
movement<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.030> see<00:02:26.060> one<00:02:26.300> guy<00:02:26.450> signs<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.050> see
