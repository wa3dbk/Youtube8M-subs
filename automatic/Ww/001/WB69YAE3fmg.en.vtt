00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
to recover from when you train the thing

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.460 
to recover from when you train the thing
even<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.790> do<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.150> what's<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.660> yeah<00:02:38.230> see

now<00:02:38.500> their<00:02:39.280> prints<00:02:39.640> us<00:02:39.989> technique<00:02:40.989> or

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
now their prints us technique or

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.059 
now their prints us technique or
whatever<00:02:41.319> ask<00:02:41.500> me<00:02:41.650> you've<00:02:41.800> lift<00:02:41.980> a

going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> lift<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.650> heavy<00:02:44.830> right<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.280> but

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
going to lift this heavy right here but

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.059 
going to lift this heavy right here but
see<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.120> cold<00:02:46.450> key<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:47.380> bigger<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
see the cold key and get bigger and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.210 
see the cold key and get bigger and
stronger<00:02:48.400> if<00:02:48.760> your<00:02:48.970> natural<00:02:49.510> yes<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.830> gotta

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
stronger if your natural yes you gotta

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.370 
stronger if your natural yes you gotta
get<00:02:51.519> stronger<00:02:51.940> you're<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.420> gonna<00:02:52.569> be<00:02:52.810> you're

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
get stronger you're not gonna be you're

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.530 
get stronger you're not gonna be you're
not<00:02:53.560> gonna<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.280> can't<00:02:54.610> get<00:02:54.819> stronger<00:02:55.150> using

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
not gonna you can't get stronger using

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.690 
not gonna you can't get stronger using
that<00:02:55.780> technique<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:56.650> not<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.069> most

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that technique but it's not the most
