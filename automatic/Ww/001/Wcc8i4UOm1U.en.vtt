00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 Greetings today I'll show you again 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.759
 a tomato sauce recipe because we always 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.500
 These tomatoes are still allowed on us 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.109
 come 10 and work in Duisburg 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.519
 the difference is to the last sauce 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 that I do not do that today but 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.630
 small tailor a while to cook and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.969
 then through the fleet lotte 3 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 and then it happened 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.380
 and there could be larger quantities 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 Guilty when the garden is over 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 the course great dish on sample 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 could also have something to do there and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 I'll show you how I am there 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 Action 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.620
 First wash the stalk valladolid 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 Let's talk about that is important 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 plugs 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 because rausschneiden power as usual and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.620
 then we make rough pieces easy 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 the same pot is yes too 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.430
 Sold quite fast and allowed to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170
 also a little more mature than tomatoes are then 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 you have to devour the body well 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 to prepare a salad 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 I have already uploaded video 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.830
 we still need some block running 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 an onion and something bad I like it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.290
 just open and can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 basil or organ takes that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.240
 ask for salt pepper and of course 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.210
 buy olive oil and then it goes on 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.880
 if the tomatoes bought reasonably 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.130
 that's what he has to do through the fleet 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.130
 can turn and recognize 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.340
 thoma 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.410
 I now have half of three studies 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.230
 let the pot cook by the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:14.750
 Fleet lotte happen and then I go 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 just the whole group things here 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.760
 to have in there, we all materials all away 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.760
 get euro 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.300
 then en masse works also determines 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.400
 quite a nice amount or a make 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.410
 then I think that it with the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 Fleet lotte like all of them individually today 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.320
 the looks like that now 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.050
 not much 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.510
 where I do but all the tomatoes 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.000
 I passed here in the pot 1 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.690
 and now we still need to stick with it 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.570
 you can reduce the sauce 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.220
 Do not forget the people from Munich 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.220
 not necessarily get driving 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.670
 next to the commission a procedure 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.670
 ultimately the other two things too 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.690
 come in the hot peppers and the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.950
 Photographers then flew to watch as well 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.269
 that does not get dark 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.970
 and yet there is some bread left 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.690
 sugar in and there could be too 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.160
 Take such a teaspoon or one 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.599
 coffee spoon more so always 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.599
 caramelize 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.230
 Put everything in and let it boil down 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.480
 the sauce reduce quite a while 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.280
 Leave 2 steels such because he like it 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.890
 Most of the tomatoes are made 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.379
 water and it would even let waste 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:22.550
 now has a bit rosier 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:25.610
 consistency some salt in and of the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.330
 murano because i like it with oregano though 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.690
 friend already said you can too 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.520
 basil pepper thomas at the very end 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.830
 keep pure in the partner nothing else 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.750
 the aroma of then flies the relative 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.400
 fast i make a few generations 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.669
 and then I show at the end 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.770
 how should the catella looks like that? 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 nice that will be a little less 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.240
 liquid more electronic ticket it 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.840
 here you have to be careful that it is 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.710
 not burning down and also careful 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.479
 with the temperature 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.090
 You probably do not have to be pretty 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.000
 go down so splashing that all follows 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.940
 so far are so on our finished 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.820
 Sauce out I 've got this before 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:16.490
 it fits perfectly, of course 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.669
 a bit of parmesan cheese and me 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.099
 wish you 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.490
 good appetite and much success in the 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.490
 to cook
