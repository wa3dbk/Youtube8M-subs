and<00:02:54.989> charging<00:02:55.410> or<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.760> actually<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
and charging or not this is actually a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.390 
and charging or not this is actually a
battery<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:57.900> well<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.500> doubles<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.190> says

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
battery as well and it doubles it says

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.640 
battery as well and it doubles it says
it<00:02:59.580> doubles<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.110> battery<00:03:01.110> life<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.380> haven't

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it doubles the battery life I haven't

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.460 
it doubles the battery life I haven't
tested<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.040> out<00:03:02.340> yet<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:02.959> on<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> bottom

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
tested that out yet but on the bottom

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.500 
tested that out yet but on the bottom
you<00:03:04.709> notice<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.489> nice<00:03:05.640> knobs<00:03:05.970> kids

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you notice it's got the nice knobs kids

you notice it's got the nice knobs kids
feet<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.400> has<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.670> same<00:03:08.910> pattern

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
feet on it and it has the same pattern

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.820 
feet on it and it has the same pattern
on<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.170> bottom<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:11.640> match<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.450> outside<00:03:13.410> of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
on the bottom to match the outside of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.500 
on the bottom to match the outside of
the<00:03:13.890> tablet<00:03:15.530> let's<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.860> away<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.510> show

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the tablet let's put this away and show

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.440 
the tablet let's put this away and show
you<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.750> hardware<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> tablet<00:03:20.070> itself

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
you the hardware of the tablet itself

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.440 
you the hardware of the tablet itself
now<00:03:21.450> again<00:03:22.250> sort<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> slow<00:03:23.820> lag<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
now again sort of have a slow lag in the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.150 
now again sort of have a slow lag in the
rotation<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.530> think<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
rotation of it I think that's just a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.710 
rotation of it I think that's just a
honeycomb<00:03:26.579> thing<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> tablet<00:03:27.360> thing

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
honeycomb thing and not a tablet thing

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.569 
honeycomb thing and not a tablet thing
because<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.049> played<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.070> number<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.430> them

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
because I played with a number of them

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.220 
because I played with a number of them
and<00:03:29.670> they<00:03:29.790> don't<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:31.110> the

a rear facing camera

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.899 
a rear facing camera
to<00:04:25.139> have<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.379> really<00:04:25.560> tested<00:04:25.919> out<00:04:26.039> yet<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.550> whole

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
to have it really tested out yet a whole

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.180 
to have it really tested out yet a whole
lot<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.210> seems<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.629> be<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> decent<00:04:28.050> quality<00:04:28.949> I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
lot but seems to be a decent quality I

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.700 
lot but seems to be a decent quality I
like<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.639> feel<00:04:29.849> of<00:04:29.879> it<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:31.080> feels<00:04:31.319> sturdy

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
like the feel of it it feels sturdy

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.089 
like the feel of it it feels sturdy
there's<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> lot<00:04:32.879> of<00:04:32.909> bend<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:33.569> and<00:04:34.099> so

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
there's not a lot of bend to it and so

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.619 
there's not a lot of bend to it and so
my<00:04:35.370> first<00:04:35.580> impressions<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.449> are

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
hard to do it in this direction but

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.770 
hard to do it in this direction but
let's<00:05:08.039> see<00:05:08.190> if<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.580> find<00:05:08.789> some<00:05:08.969> bad<00:05:09.479> guys<00:05:09.719> to

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
let's see if I can find some bad guys to

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.839 
let's see if I can find some bad guys to
kill<00:05:10.250> if<00:05:11.250> it's<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:12.440> zombie<00:05:13.440> shooter<00:05:14.159> game<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
kill if it's a zombie shooter game and

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:23.439 
kill if it's a zombie shooter game and
I'm<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:15.930> very<00:05:16.110> good<00:05:16.199> at<00:05:18.650> there<00:05:19.650> we<00:05:19.830> go<00:05:20.060> alright

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.180 

so<00:05:24.449> you<00:05:24.539> get<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.750> idea<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:25.139> works<00:05:25.830> really<00:05:25.979> nice

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
for a while and i get a good feel for

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.379 
for a while and i get a good feel for
that<00:06:05.159> and<00:06:05.400> then<00:06:05.490> after<00:06:05.639> that<00:06:05.819> i'll<00:06:06.029> root<00:06:06.240> it

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
that and then after that i'll root it

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.839 
that and then after that i'll root it
and<00:06:06.449> talk<00:06:06.659> about<00:06:06.690> how<00:06:07.080> hard<00:06:07.770> or<00:06:07.979> easy<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.460> is<00:06:08.580> to

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
and talk about how hard or easy it is to

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.670 
and talk about how hard or easy it is to
to<00:06:09.270> root<00:06:09.449> the<00:06:09.599> device<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:09.900> whether<00:06:10.259> that<00:06:10.349> adds

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
to root the device and whether that adds

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.740 
to root the device and whether that adds
much<00:06:10.889> to<00:06:11.099> it<00:06:11.219> but<00:06:11.849> so<00:06:12.029> far<00:06:12.180> i'm<00:06:12.330> pretty<00:06:12.509> pleased

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
much to it but so far i'm pretty pleased

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.839 
much to it but so far i'm pretty pleased
with<00:06:12.779> it<00:06:12.990> after<00:06:13.770> having<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.129> acer<00:06:14.430> home<00:06:14.610> for<00:06:14.819> a

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
with it after having the acer home for a

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.550 
with it after having the acer home for a
few<00:06:15.029> days<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.719> I<00:06:15.840> kind<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.139> felt<00:06:16.349> like<00:06:16.379> I
