it's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> typical<00:00:32.250> drop<00:00:32.460> test<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> probably

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it's a typical drop test as you probably

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
it's a typical drop test as you probably
know<00:00:33.329> by<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.140> dropping<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.959 
know by now I'm going to be dropping it
on<00:00:34.680> its<00:00:35.250> back<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.730> its<00:00:36.510> bottom<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> finally<00:00:37.969> on

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
on its back on its bottom and finally on

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.709 
on its back on its bottom and finally on
its<00:00:39.180> face<00:00:39.680> okay<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> our<00:00:41.219> before<00:00:41.579> shot<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
its face okay here is our before shot to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
its face okay here is our before shot to
showing<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> phone<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> my<00:00:43.770> hand<00:00:43.980> right

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
showing you the phone in my hand right

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.360 
showing you the phone in my hand right
now<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> soft<00:00:45.750> touch<00:00:46.219> plastic<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now it's not the soft touch plastic that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.920 
now it's not the soft touch plastic that
wraps<00:00:47.610> around<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.210> phone<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
wraps around the phone all the way to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
wraps around the phone all the way to
the<00:00:49.110> front<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.160> too<00:00:50.309> sure<00:00:50.340> if

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the front so we're not too sure if

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
the front so we're not too sure if
there's<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.030> separation<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there's going to be separation in the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
there's going to be separation in the
panel's<00:00:52.350> Android<00:00:52.980> 4.4<00:00:53.460> KitKat<00:00:53.670> running<00:00:54.090> just

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
panel's Android 4.4 KitKat running just

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
panel's Android 4.4 KitKat running just
fine<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> get

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
fine on here and we're about to get

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
fine on here and we're about to get
started<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> test<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> what<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
started on the test so this is what the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
started on the test so this is what the
phone<00:00:57.899> pretty<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
phone pretty much looks like in a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.299 
phone pretty much looks like in a
pristine<00:00:59.550> condition<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:01.070> think<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.160> drop

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
pristine condition I think it's drop

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
pristine condition I think it's drop
test<00:01:02.520> time<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.719> checking<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.049> my

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
test time all right just checking on my

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.570 
test time all right just checking on my
camera's<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> first<00:01:05.309> test

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
camera's here we go with the first test

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
camera's here we go with the first test
on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> Google<00:01:06.119> Nexus<00:01:06.270> 5<00:01:06.600> falling<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.380> onto

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
on the Google Nexus 5 falling right onto

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
on the Google Nexus 5 falling right onto
its<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.670> let's<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.299> happens<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
its back so let's see what happens on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:19.630 
its back so let's see what happens on
three<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:11.700> one

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.310 

so<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.360> looks<00:01:20.510> like<00:01:20.570> my<00:01:20.720> dropping<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.200> not

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
so it looks like my dropping is not

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.720 
so it looks like my dropping is not
quite<00:01:21.530> as<00:01:21.740> good<00:01:21.890> as<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.160> was<00:01:22.280> in<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.520> last

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
quite as good as it was in the last

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.340 
quite as good as it was in the last
couple<00:01:22.880> tests<00:01:23.210> because<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.870> landed<00:01:24.230> a<00:01:24.260> little

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
couple tests because it landed a little

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.710 
couple tests because it landed a little
bit<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:24.620> its<00:01:24.770> corner<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.120> concern<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.570> I

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
bit on its corner but a concern that I

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.330 
bit on its corner but a concern that I
had<00:01:26.930> definitely<00:01:27.410> came<00:01:27.590> about<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.130> this

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
had definitely came about in this

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.190 
had definitely came about in this
particular<00:01:28.490> test<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.360> separation<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
particular test the separation in the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.110 
particular test the separation in the
panels<00:01:30.530> does<00:01:30.770> cause<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.250> back<00:01:31.400> cover<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.880> come

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
panels does cause the back cover to come

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.760 
panels does cause the back cover to come
off<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.540> little<00:01:32.570> bit<00:01:32.900> after<00:01:33.080> impacting<00:01:33.680> on

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
off just a little bit after impacting on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.620 
off just a little bit after impacting on
a<00:01:33.800> corner<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.430> wasn't<00:01:34.910> able<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.120> get<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.360> fall

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
a corner I wasn't able to get to fall

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.420 
a corner I wasn't able to get to fall
flat<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.080> we<00:01:36.170> still<00:01:36.380> see<00:01:36.440> some<00:01:36.830> damage<00:01:37.010> even

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
flat but we still see some damage even

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.890 
flat but we still see some damage even
though<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.610> landed<00:01:37.880> on<00:01:37.970> its<00:01:38.120> corner<00:01:38.360> which

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
though it landed on its corner which

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.680 
though it landed on its corner which
probably<00:01:39.500> was<00:01:39.680> maybe<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.250> little<00:01:40.310> bit<00:01:40.550> worse

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
probably was maybe a little bit worse

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.060 
probably was maybe a little bit worse
all<00:01:41.690> right<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.960> got<00:01:42.110> damage<00:01:42.290> on<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.620> bottom<00:01:42.950> of

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
all right we got damage on the bottom of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.340 
all right we got damage on the bottom of
the<00:01:43.160> phone<00:01:43.370> in<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.640> corner<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.630> cover<00:01:45.020> does

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
the phone in the corner the cover does

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.930 
the phone in the corner the cover does
snap<00:01:45.590> right<00:01:45.800> back<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.190> like<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.520> did<00:01:46.760> right

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
snap right back in like I just did right

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.610 
snap right back in like I just did right
now<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.660> does<00:01:47.900> come<00:01:48.110> back<00:01:48.320> there<00:01:48.500> is

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
now so it does come back there is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.380 
now so it does come back there is
scuffing<00:01:48.980> on<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.160> corner<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.030> cover<00:01:50.180> did

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
scuffing on the corner and the cover did

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.520 
scuffing on the corner and the cover did
start<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.630> separate<00:01:50.900> but<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.110> was<00:01:51.230> able<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.440> get

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
start to separate but I was able to get

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.810 
start to separate but I was able to get
that<00:01:51.710> right<00:01:51.920> back<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.400> I<00:01:52.490> have<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> drop

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
that right back in there I have to drop

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.370 
that right back in there I have to drop
it<00:01:53.000> back<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.360> particular<00:01:53.960> spot<00:01:54.140> again

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
it back on that particular spot again

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.050 
it back on that particular spot again
because<00:01:54.680> we're<00:01:54.800> gonna<00:01:54.890> do<00:01:55.130> our<00:01:55.160> bottom<00:01:55.820> test

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
because we're gonna do our bottom test

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:07.810 
because we're gonna do our bottom test
so<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:56.450> we<00:01:56.540> go<00:01:56.660> in<00:01:57.190> three<00:01:58.190> two<00:01:58.780> one

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.150 

looks<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:08.930> we<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.170> more<00:02:09.200> scuffs<00:02:09.740> on<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
looks like we have more scuffs on the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.460 
looks like we have more scuffs on the
bottom<00:02:10.729> but<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.750> no<00:02:11.900> damage<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
bottom but there really is no damage to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.440 
bottom but there really is no damage to
at<00:02:12.680> least<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> screen<00:02:13.340> for<00:02:13.580> now<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.940> we

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
at least the screen for now and we

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.790 
at least the screen for now and we
didn't<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.080> separation<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.680> back

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
didn't have a separation of the back

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.250 
didn't have a separation of the back
once<00:02:16.010> again<00:02:16.390> now<00:02:17.390> we're<00:02:17.600> going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:18.050> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
once again now we're going to do the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.900 
once again now we're going to do the
final<00:02:18.560> test<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.100> Google<00:02:19.460> Nexus<00:02:19.580> 5<00:02:19.880> and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
final test of the Google Nexus 5 and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.480 
final test of the Google Nexus 5 and
that's<00:02:20.210> falling<00:02:20.600> right<00:02:20.870> onto<00:02:21.320> its<00:02:21.560> face<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
that's falling right onto its face this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.860 
that's falling right onto its face this
is<00:02:22.670> where<00:02:22.790> some<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> worst<00:02:23.270> damage<00:02:23.540> can

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
is where some of the worst damage can

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.600 
is where some of the worst damage can
possibly<00:02:24.200> happen<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> phone<00:02:24.860> from<00:02:25.400> about

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
possibly happen on the phone from about

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.640 
possibly happen on the phone from about
chest<00:02:25.850> level<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.620> 3<00:02:27.620> 2<00:02:28.400> 1

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
chest level in 3 2 1

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.730 
chest level in 3 2 1
whew

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.430 

a<00:02:38.890> lot<00:02:39.760> more<00:02:39.910> damage<00:02:40.090> than<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.450> had<00:02:40.630> expected<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
a lot more damage than I had expected I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440 
a lot more damage than I had expected I
mean<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> expect<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> damage<00:02:43.120> but<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.420> oh

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
mean I expect the damage but that oh

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.540 
mean I expect the damage but that oh
this<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.870> not<00:02:44.110> good<00:02:44.350> at<00:02:44.470> all<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.830> was<00:02:45.130> expecting

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
this is not good at all I was expecting

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.270 
this is not good at all I was expecting
the<00:02:45.640> screen<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.260> crack<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.010> wasn't

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the screen to crack but I wasn't

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
the screen to crack but I wasn't
expecting<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.730> circuits<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.240> show<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
expecting the circuits to show up on the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
expecting the circuits to show up on the
bottom<00:02:50.440> like<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.340> one<00:02:51.550> drop<00:02:51.790> we've

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
bottom like that in just one drop we've

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.050 
bottom like that in just one drop we've
already<00:02:52.270> exposed<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.050> inside<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> phone

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
already exposed the inside of the phone

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.060 
already exposed the inside of the phone
so<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.120> saw<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.390> before<00:02:55.930> shot<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.830> gave

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
so you saw the before shot that I gave

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.710 
so you saw the before shot that I gave
you<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.490> phone<00:02:57.640> working<00:02:57.880> let's<00:02:58.270> see<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.570> it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
you of the phone working let's see if it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.210 
you of the phone working let's see if it
still<00:02:58.960> works<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.320> there's<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.800> screen<00:02:59.980> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
still works so there's the screen it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.170 
still works so there's the screen it
actually<00:03:00.250> turns<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:02.440> go<00:03:02.710> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
actually turns on and there go the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.630 
actually turns on and there go the
elements<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.350> still<00:03:05.620> operational

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
elements so it's still operational

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.790 
elements so it's still operational
to<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> fault<00:03:07.360> however<00:03:08.200> getting<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.530> back<00:03:08.650> down

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
to a fault however getting you back down

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.290 
to a fault however getting you back down
here<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.130> probably<00:03:09.460> not<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.790> safe<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.210> of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
here is probably not that safe and of

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
here is probably not that safe and of
course<00:03:10.510> yeah<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.900> run<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> risk<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.560> usual<00:03:12.040> of

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
course yeah you run the risk as usual of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.660 
course yeah you run the risk as usual of
sort<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.410> nicking<00:03:14.800> your<00:03:14.830> thumb<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.640> you're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
sort of nicking your thumb when you're

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.700 
sort of nicking your thumb when you're
swiping<00:03:16.150> across<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.660> screen<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> most

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
swiping across the screen for the most

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.440 
swiping across the screen for the most
part<00:03:17.920> however<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.280> looks<00:03:18.520> like<00:03:18.760> pretty<00:03:19.240> much

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
part however it looks like pretty much

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.160 
part however it looks like pretty much
most<00:03:20.350> if<00:03:20.680> not<00:03:20.710> all<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> screen<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.900> needs

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
most if not all of the screen that needs

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.800 
most if not all of the screen that needs
to<00:03:23.350> work<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.800> working<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.940> maybe<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.780> a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
to work is working so maybe that is a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.690 
to work is working so maybe that is a
plus<00:03:26.020> but<00:03:26.320> still<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.770> is<00:03:26.830> really<00:03:27.370> really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
plus but still this is really really

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.750 
plus but still this is really really
crazy<00:03:28.740> but<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.860> most<00:03:30.040> impressive<00:03:30.400> part<00:03:30.580> about

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
crazy but the most impressive part about

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.520 
crazy but the most impressive part about
this<00:03:30.880> phone<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.360> despite<00:03:31.720> all<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.110> it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
this phone is I despite all of that it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.920 
this phone is I despite all of that it
is<00:03:32.860> still<00:03:33.070> highly<00:03:33.550> operational<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.510> found

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
is still highly operational I found
