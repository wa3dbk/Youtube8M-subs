00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.879 

this<00:03:59.569> is<00:03:59.629> very<00:03:59.930> genuine<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.500> mean<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:00.769> know<00:04:00.859> each

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
this is very genuine I mean we know each

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.220 
this is very genuine I mean we know each
other's<00:04:01.250> families<00:04:01.459> we<00:04:01.849> socialize<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.780> I

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
other's families we socialize and I

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.289 
other's families we socialize and I
think<00:04:03.469> what<00:04:03.650> really<00:04:03.859> made<00:04:04.069> this<00:04:04.189> newscast<00:04:04.430> a

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
think what really made this newscast a

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.699 
think what really made this newscast a
little<00:04:05.689> bit<00:04:05.810> different<00:04:06.169> than<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.379> other<00:04:06.500> ones

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
little bit different than the other ones

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.099 
little bit different than the other ones
is<00:04:06.889> we're<00:04:07.280> really<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.669> family<00:04:08.000> here<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:08.989> we

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
is we're really a family here and if we

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.449 
is we're really a family here and if we
can<00:04:09.230> take<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.439> shot<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:09.949> people<00:04:10.250> here<00:04:10.400> you

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
can take a shot of the people here you

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.220 
can take a shot of the people here you
wouldn't<00:04:10.669> believe<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.030> folks<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.480> it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
wouldn't believe the folks that it

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.839 
wouldn't believe the folks that it
permeates<00:04:12.709> throughout<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.280> building<00:04:13.639> and

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
permeates throughout the building and

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.779 
permeates throughout the building and
there<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.090> go<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.859> family<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:19.549> think

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
there you go it is a family and I think

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.969 
there you go it is a family and I think
most<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.120> all<00:04:20.299> for<00:04:20.780> me<00:04:20.900> I'm<00:04:21.470> gonna<00:04:21.620> miss<00:04:21.829> the
