00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.740
 hello hi michael angel rocha i hope 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.150
 you're fine then I'm going to do the 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.850
 of jungle that I take and review of a 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.070
 microsd memory of 128 gigabytes of the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
 mark sand ix here we see the design of the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.180
 handix packaging almost always brings out two 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.369
 packaging designs for the same 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.710
 product since one is aimed at itself 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.960
 for digital cameras and another for 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.759
 mobile devices but itself is 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 the same article the only difference is 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.259
 that the one that goes for mobile devices 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.970
 includes an application called memory 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.680
 zone the sun dix and the one that is for 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.239
 digital cameras does not include you from there 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.640
 on the outside is the same article ie 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.309
 the same micro sd and well then here the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.399
 we have this micro sd includes what 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.070
 is the micro sd to sd adapter 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.280
 standard and we found what it is because it is 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.930
 the micro sd and of course its case in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.420
 the part of the transformation after the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.710
 product as well as good warranty because 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.039
 for not doing this longer I'm going to 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.629
 proceed to open the memory I will 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.760
 guide me shopping with dotted lines 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.760
 to see if it goes well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 while I take out the article I tell you that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 this micro sd has a cost of one hundred 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.500
 from $ 100 to $ 150 there 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.500
 is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.870
 I'm going to do this aside 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 and good here we have the case with 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.770
 our micro sd memory of 128 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 gigabytes and of course the adapter 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 This case is very good to carry 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.980
 where we want our micro sd and 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 adapter I'm going to take out the adapter and 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.979
 here we are going to see andy brands 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 micro sdhc and micro sd micro adapter 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.740
 sd x can not be appreciated well here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 there is like a little button if we 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.960
 we move this down we activate the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.760
 anti-deletion mode is to say us as 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 put on the pc the adapter with the 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.380
 memory and we go back to some file it does not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 will erase us so it's to avoid 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.140
 that we accidentally delete some file 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.239
 let's see this fact in china 2014 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 of 5 of the 20 and well then this one is going to 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.959
 make a side and let's go to what we 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.959
 interesting what is the micro sd 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 I'm going to see if you focus on it there you are andic 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.290
 ultra version of 128 gb slave series 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.930
 as we know in the semicircle that 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.780
 comes printed we see the number says 10 is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 micro sd x I have practically explain 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.540
 the difference between a xcy and a hc 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.370
 here we can see what a sandisk is 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.420
 ultra equal but in this case it says micro 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.019
 sd 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.510
 hc the difference between hc and xc is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.629
 that the x is coming in exfat format and the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.269
 hs comes in fat32 format the difference 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.159
 of its two formats is that the fas 32 does not 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.500
 allows moving files larger than 4 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.920
 gigabytes while the x if I 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.080
 allows someone outside are the same 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 and we can see that it includes a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.130
 one next to the c is what it is and that 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.170
 ultra high speed certification that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.730
 wants to be ultra high speed which 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 according to the manufacturer is to have this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.380
 certification allows a writing 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.050
 minimum of 10 megabytes per second and one 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.920
 minimum reading equal to 30 megabytes per 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
 second 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.210
 I quickly show you on the back of 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.540
 the micro sd 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.250
 and we can see the serial number by 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.740
 course where it's been made in this 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.380
 case in china is the little box that we see 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.810
 it is the one according to I know that it is where 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.490
 covers what is the memory chip and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.650
 Well, in general, that would be all 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.960
 unpacking and review of the micro sd 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.300
 of 128 gigabytes brand sand ix version 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.660
 Ultra I hope you liked it and up 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.660
 the next
