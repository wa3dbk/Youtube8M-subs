period of time the final phase of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
period of time the final phase of
testing<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.859> anywhere<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:29.580> five<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> six

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
testing can be anywhere from five to six

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.450 
testing can be anywhere from five to six
weeks<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.109> longest<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> those<00:00:32.009> studies<00:00:32.309> was

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
weeks the longest of those studies was

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.430 
weeks the longest of those studies was
eight<00:00:32.610> weeks<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.420> shortest<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.960> four<00:00:34.200> weeks

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
eight weeks the shortest was four weeks

eight weeks the shortest was four weeks
so<00:00:35.219> these<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.640> long<00:00:35.969> term<00:00:36.510> studies<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so these are not long term studies I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
so these are not long term studies I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
