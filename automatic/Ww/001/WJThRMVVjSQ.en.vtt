they're<00:02:04.240> not<00:02:04.509> ready<00:02:04.899> yet<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.320> I'm<00:02:05.469> going<00:02:05.649> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
they're not ready yet so I'm going to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.590 
they're not ready yet so I'm going to
put<00:02:05.860> them<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.070> for<00:02:06.250> another<00:02:06.430> 30<00:02:06.820> seconds<00:02:07.360> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
put them in for another 30 seconds and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.819 
put them in for another 30 seconds and
see<00:02:07.899> how<00:02:08.049> that<00:02:08.110> goes

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
see how that goes

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.009 
see how that goes
ok<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.759> chocolate<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.299> looking<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.720> lot<00:02:10.959> better

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
ok the chocolate is looking a lot better

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.020 
ok the chocolate is looking a lot better
after<00:02:11.709> another<00:02:11.920> 30<00:02:12.340> seconds<00:02:12.820> in<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
after another 30 seconds in the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.600 
after another 30 seconds in the
microwave<00:02:13.440> remember<00:02:14.440> I'm<00:02:14.590> only<00:02:14.769> microwaving

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
microwave remember I'm only microwaving

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.180 
microwave remember I'm only microwaving
this<00:02:15.730> 1/2<00:02:16.329> power<00:02:16.750> I'd<00:02:17.350> rather<00:02:17.620> go<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> little

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
this 1/2 power I'd rather go a little

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.290 
this 1/2 power I'd rather go a little
bit<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.549> slow<00:02:18.760> side

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
bit on the slow side

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020 
bit on the slow side
then<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> chocolate<00:02:21.160> dry<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.910> then

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
then have the chocolate dry out and then

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.690 
then have the chocolate dry out and then
I<00:02:22.060> can't<00:02:22.390> use<00:02:22.480> them<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.770> can<00:02:23.890> see<00:02:24.100> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I can't use them so as you can see it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.360 
I can't use them so as you can see it's
pretty<00:02:24.940> well<00:02:25.300> ready<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> add<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> short<00:02:26.830> I've

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
pretty well ready to add the short I've

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.370 
pretty well ready to add the short I've
stirred<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.940> my<00:02:28.090> shortening<00:02:28.630> but<00:02:29.200> there's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
stirred in my shortening but there's

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440 
stirred in my shortening but there's
still<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> lot<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.160> chocolate<00:02:30.640> lumps<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.150> here

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
still a lot of chocolate lumps in here

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.510 
still a lot of chocolate lumps in here
so<00:02:32.080> I'm<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> put<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.740> back<00:02:33.040> into<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
so I'm going to put it back into the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.340 
so I'm going to put it back into the
microwave<00:02:33.670> for<00:02:34.030> another<00:02:34.120> 30<00:02:34.510> seconds<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.170> see

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
microwave for another 30 seconds and see

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.950 
microwave for another 30 seconds and see
if<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.770> will<00:02:35.950> be<00:02:36.280> enough<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.240> smooth<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.810> all

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
if that will be enough to smooth out all

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.830 
if that will be enough to smooth out all
the<00:02:38.260> lumps<00:02:38.580> after<00:02:39.580> microwaving<00:02:40.270> for<00:02:40.600> another

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the lumps after microwaving for another

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.230 
the lumps after microwaving for another
30<00:02:41.200> seconds<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:42.040> did<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> trick<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
30 seconds it did the trick the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.030 
30 seconds it did the trick the
chocolate<00:02:43.720> after<00:02:43.900> stirring<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
chocolate after stirring for just a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.430 
chocolate after stirring for just a
little<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.310> came<00:02:45.850> out<00:02:46.000> nice<00:02:46.210> and<00:02:46.240> smooth<00:02:46.780> so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
little bit came out nice and smooth so

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.140 
little bit came out nice and smooth so
now<00:02:47.650> we're<00:02:47.830> ready<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.100> dip<00:02:48.370> our<00:02:48.490> strawberries

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
into it I'm going to take the halves of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.280

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that and that's going to be the head of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.210 
that and that's going to be the head of
the<00:03:04.050> ladybugs<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.480> do<00:03:07.660> another<00:03:07.990> one<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:09.100> you

just<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.610> keep<00:03:09.760> repeating<00:03:10.150> this

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
just going to keep repeating this

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.150 
just going to keep repeating this
process<00:03:10.930> while<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.350> chocolate<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.010> still

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
process while the chocolate is still

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.370 
process while the chocolate is still
nice<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.730> warm<00:03:13.120> now<00:03:13.330> as<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.230> this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
nice and warm now as you can see this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.050 
nice and warm now as you can see this
serve<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.740> was<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> still<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> little<00:03:15.430> damp<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
serve it was a still a little damp and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.730 
serve it was a still a little damp and
the<00:03:16.540> chocolate<00:03:16.900> doesn't<00:03:17.050> want<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.350> stick<00:03:17.590> to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
the chocolate doesn't want to stick to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.820 
the chocolate doesn't want to stick to
it<00:03:17.830> quite<00:03:18.160> as<00:03:18.400> well<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:20.320> just<00:03:20.530> kind<00:03:20.710> of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
it quite as well so that just kind of

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.920 
it quite as well so that just kind of
this<00:03:21.040> emphasizes<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.150> point<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:22.900> really

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
this emphasizes the point that we really

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.420 
this emphasizes the point that we really
need<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.410> make<00:03:23.530> sure<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.830> strawberries<00:03:24.310> are

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
need to make sure the strawberries are

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.580 
need to make sure the strawberries are
nice<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:24.790> dry<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.350> see

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
nice and dry and so here you can see

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
nice and dry and so here you can see
I've<00:03:26.770> done<00:03:26.800> four<00:03:27.280> strawberries<00:03:27.600> you're<00:03:28.600> going

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
I've done four strawberries you're going

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.890 
I've done four strawberries you're going
to<00:03:28.810> let<00:03:28.959> them<00:03:29.110> sit<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.890> wire<00:03:30.280> rack<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to let them sit on this wire rack to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.920 
to let them sit on this wire rack to
finish<00:03:32.820> letting<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> chocolate<00:03:34.360> harden<00:03:34.750> and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
finish letting the chocolate harden and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.750 
finish letting the chocolate harden and
then<00:03:35.350> we're<00:03:35.920> going<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.070> move<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.610> next

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
then we're going to move on to the next

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.090 
then we're going to move on to the next
step<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.360> have<00:03:37.840> finished<00:03:38.170> dipping<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.980> my

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
step I have finished dipping all of my

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.500 
step I have finished dipping all of my
strawberries<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.850> chocolate<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.360> now

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
strawberries in the chocolate and now

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.810 
strawberries in the chocolate and now
I'm<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:40.660> waiting<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> harden<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
I'm just waiting for it to harden in the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.180 
I'm just waiting for it to harden in the
