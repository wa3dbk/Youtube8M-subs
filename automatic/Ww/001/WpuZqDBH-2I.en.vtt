00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 such an interesting struggle i mean i can 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 say that the construction is valid with 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 the past year, competition has increased 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
 in turn, the caterpillar breaks off from the start 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.870
 bite into the 5 kilometer highway to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.580
 which way 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.580
 the mines were days anti-tank ditches 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 bmp-2 like a gymnast on a log

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 crossing but this barrier is clearly 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.920
 demonstrates it turns out and for tanks 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.920
 then there are speed bumps 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.570
