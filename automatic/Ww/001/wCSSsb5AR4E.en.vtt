00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.629 

in<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.350> following<00:00:07.649> videos<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.280> gonna<00:00:08.519> be

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
in the following videos I'm gonna be

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.400 
in the following videos I'm gonna be
taking<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.090> through<00:00:09.120> some<00:00:09.629> really<00:00:09.870> key<00:00:10.230> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
taking you through some really key and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.650 
taking you through some really key and
well-thought-out<00:00:11.039> swing<00:00:11.340> principles<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.090> if

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
well-thought-out swing principles and if

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.299 
well-thought-out swing principles and if
you<00:00:12.750> work<00:00:12.959> on<00:00:13.139> these<00:00:13.260> areas<00:00:13.680> then<00:00:13.920> no<00:00:14.129> doubt

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
you work on these areas then no doubt

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.429 
you work on these areas then no doubt
your<00:00:14.849> ball<00:00:15.059> strike<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.809> improve

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
your ball strike is going to improve

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.980 
your ball strike is going to improve
however<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.730> really<00:00:18.090> understand<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
however if we really understand the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
however if we really understand the
exact<00:00:19.320> detail<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.919> how<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.099> club<00:00:20.369> strikes<00:00:20.669> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
exact detail of how the club strikes the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
exact detail of how the club strikes the
ball<00:00:20.970> then<00:00:21.630> you're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.899> to<00:00:22.020> improve<00:00:22.290> a<00:00:22.439> lot

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
ball then you're going to improve a lot

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.670 
ball then you're going to improve a lot
faster<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.939> by<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.329> I<00:00:24.390> mean<00:00:24.750> understanding

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
faster so by that I mean understanding

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.130 
faster so by that I mean understanding
exactly<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> club<00:00:26.759> comes<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.300> makes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
exactly how the club comes down makes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.409 
exactly how the club comes down makes
contact<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.739> ball<00:00:28.829> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:30.000> takes<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
contact with the ball and then takes a

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.110 
contact with the ball and then takes a
divot<00:00:30.719> and<00:00:31.219> in<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.399> experience<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.880> lot<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
divot and in my experience a lot of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.549 
divot and in my experience a lot of
swings<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> aren't<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:34.290> working

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
swings I see that aren't really working

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
swings I see that aren't really working
out<00:00:35.059> originated<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> misunderstanding

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
out originated from a misunderstanding

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.310 
out originated from a misunderstanding
of<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:38.100> core<00:00:38.700> principle<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.170> let's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
of this really core principle so let's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
of this really core principle so let's
have<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.470> think<00:00:40.740> about<00:00:40.800> exactly<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.240> does

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
have a think about exactly that how does

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
have a think about exactly that how does
the<00:00:42.540> club<00:00:42.750> strike<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> ball<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the club strike the ball and get the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.540 
the club strike the ball and get the
thing<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.970> air<00:00:45.140> well<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:47.010> motion<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
thing in the air well the motion of the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
thing in the air well the motion of the
club<00:00:47.760> head<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.150> we'll<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.570> later<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:49.200> very

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
club head as we'll see later is very

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:00.250 
club head as we'll see later is very
much<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.400> wide<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.150> flowing<00:00:52.579> certainly<00:00:53.579> arc

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.830 

the<00:01:00.800> big<00:01:01.010> distinction<00:01:01.370> then<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:01.880> where<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
the big distinction then is where is the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840 
the big distinction then is where is the
bottom<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.200> that<00:01:03.320> circle<00:01:03.829> where<00:01:04.489> should<00:01:04.640> our

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
bottom of that circle where should our

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.880 
bottom of that circle where should our
bottom<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.300> our<00:01:05.420> arc<00:01:05.600> be<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.229> relation<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.800> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
bottom of our arc be in relation to the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.520 
bottom of our arc be in relation to the
ball<00:01:07.040> well<00:01:07.940> in<00:01:08.180> actual<00:01:08.720> fact<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.200> want<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.440> be

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
ball well in actual fact we want to be

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.590 
ball well in actual fact we want to be
striking<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.070> ball<00:01:10.250> first<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
striking the ball first and then the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.810 
striking the ball first and then the
bottom<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.080> arc<00:01:12.260> would<00:01:12.680> be<00:01:12.830> possible<00:01:13.400> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
bottom of the arc would be possible and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.180 
bottom of the arc would be possible and
of<00:01:13.940> course<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.270> where<00:01:14.510> our<00:01:14.630> divot<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.190> so

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
of course that's where our divot is so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.340 
of course that's where our divot is so
as<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.460> club<00:01:16.640> comes<00:01:16.910> round<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.300> circle<00:01:17.750> it's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
as the club comes round the circle it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.109 
as the club comes round the circle it's
still<00:01:18.740> moving<00:01:19.100> down<00:01:19.310> when<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.670> hits<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.940> ball

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
still moving down when it hits the ball

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.719 
still moving down when it hits the ball
it<00:01:20.750> continues<00:01:21.440> moving<00:01:21.680> down<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.220> that's<00:01:22.550> when

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it continues moving down and that's when

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.670 
it continues moving down and that's when
our<00:01:22.820> divot<00:01:23.090> starts<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.229> bottom<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.650> the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
our divot starts and the bottom of the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.650 
our divot starts and the bottom of the
circle<00:01:25.220> will<00:01:25.490> be<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:25.759> much<00:01:25.970> as<00:01:26.180> four<00:01:26.479> inches

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
circle will be as much as four inches

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.980 
circle will be as much as four inches
past<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.710> ball<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:29.450> way<00:01:29.659> you're<00:01:29.840> always

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
past the ball that way you're always

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.810 
past the ball that way you're always
going<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.350> get<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.590> really<00:01:31.040> clean<00:01:31.340> crisp

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
going to get a really clean crisp

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.749 
going to get a really clean crisp
contact<00:01:32.300> with<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.080> ball<00:01:33.259> if<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.369> bottom<00:01:34.670> of

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
contact with the ball if the bottom of

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.639 
contact with the ball if the bottom of
your<00:01:34.789> arc<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.330> behind<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> ball<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.530> of

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
your arc is behind the ball then of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.230 
your arc is behind the ball then of
course<00:01:36.860> you're<00:01:37.039> either<00:01:37.190> going<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.580> hit<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
course you're either going to hit the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.330 
course you're either going to hit the
ground<00:01:38.479> first<00:01:38.570> or<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.680> club's<00:01:39.950> going<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.280> be

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
ground first or the club's going to be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.010 
ground first or the club's going to be
moving<00:01:40.580> upwards<00:01:41.030> as<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.210> hits<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> ball<00:01:41.660> and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
moving upwards as it hits the ball and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:02:07.820 
moving upwards as it hits the ball and
in<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.320> case<00:01:42.560> just<00:01:42.740> top<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.070> along<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.399> floor

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830 

this<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.129> really<00:02:09.700> fundamental<00:02:09.940> principle

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
this is a really fundamental principle

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.869 
this is a really fundamental principle
because<00:02:11.470> if<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.709> golfer<00:02:12.129> is<00:02:12.250> instinctively

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
because if a golfer is instinctively

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.240 
because if a golfer is instinctively
trying<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.540> hit<00:02:14.110> up<00:02:14.319> on<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.500> ball<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.980> scoot

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
trying to hit up on the ball and scoot

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.890 
trying to hit up on the ball and scoot
the<00:02:15.370> ball<00:02:15.489> off<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.670> floor<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.690> they<00:02:16.810> are

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the ball off the floor then they are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.839 
the ball off the floor then they are
destined<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.590> always<00:02:17.800> leaning<00:02:18.190> back<00:02:18.519> and

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
destined to be always leaning back and

structure<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:22.569> we<00:02:22.629> understand<00:02:23.230> this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
structure but now we understand this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
structure but now we understand this
principle<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.099> we<00:02:24.190> know<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.610> bottom<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
principle and we know the bottom of the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.210 
principle and we know the bottom of the
arc<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> other<00:02:25.810> side<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.349> ball<00:02:26.530> this

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
arc is the other side of the ball this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.250 
arc is the other side of the ball this
will<00:02:27.459> lead<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.880> into<00:02:27.910> much<00:02:28.660> better<00:02:28.930> movement

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
will lead you into much better movement

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.690 
will lead you into much better movement
with<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.680> body<00:02:29.920> through<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.310> ball<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
with your body through the ball and

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
you're also going to get a really solid

you're also going to get a really solid
