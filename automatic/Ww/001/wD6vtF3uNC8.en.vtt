mean we're just starting winters so as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.020 
mean we're just starting winters so as
far<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.329> concerned<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.380> don't<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.640> think

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
far as I'm concerned so I don't I think

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.399 
far as I'm concerned so I don't I think
this<00:01:53.299> is<00:01:53.390> gonna<00:01:53.570> kind<00:01:53.719> of<00:01:53.840> hurt<00:01:54.020> them<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> bit

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
this is gonna kind of hurt them a bit

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.020 
this is gonna kind of hurt them a bit
and<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.799> gonna<00:01:54.890> hurt<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.219> movie<00:01:55.490> because

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and it's gonna hurt the movie because

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.410 
and it's gonna hurt the movie because
really<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:57.280> would<00:01:58.280> rather<00:01:58.460> go<00:01:58.880> buy<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.149> at<00:01:59.390> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
really I would rather go buy it at the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.090 
really I would rather go buy it at the
store<00:01:59.630> than<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.439> order<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.829> or

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
store than to have to order it or

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.399 
store than to have to order it or
forcefully<00:02:01.759> basically<00:02:02.210> order<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.659> from<00:02:03.140> them

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
forcefully basically order it from them

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.380 
forcefully basically order it from them
and<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:04.280> think<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.759> also<00:02:04.909> going<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.180> cause

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
and I think this is also going to cause

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.740 
and I think this is also going to cause
a<00:02:05.420> lot<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.689> illegal<00:02:06.200> downloads<00:02:06.649> too<00:02:06.920> because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
a lot of illegal downloads too because

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.050 
a lot of illegal downloads too because
why<00:02:08.750> why<00:02:09.229> should<00:02:09.470> someone<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:10.030> restricted<00:02:11.030> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
why why should someone be restricted to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.970 
why why should someone be restricted to
buying<00:02:11.329> on<00:02:11.510> one<00:02:11.870> website<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> think<00:02:12.829> they're

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
buying on one website so I think they're

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
buying on one website so I think they're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
potentially hurting themselves here but

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.810 
potentially hurting themselves here but
you<00:02:14.840> know<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:15.890> their<00:02:16.040> company<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.640> is

the<00:02:24.640> graphics<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.359> this<00:02:25.540> movie<00:02:25.810> because<00:02:26.439> the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
the graphics in this movie because the

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.220 
the graphics in this movie because the
graphics<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.519> said<00:02:27.730> before<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:29.049> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
graphics like I said before are not the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.490 
graphics like I said before are not the
greatest<00:02:29.409> and<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:31.599> kind<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:31.989> hard<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> sit

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
greatest and it's kind of hard to sit

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.869 
greatest and it's kind of hard to sit
down<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.829> take<00:02:33.010> some<00:02:33.189> of<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.370> characters

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
down and take some of these characters

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.420 
down and take some of these characters
seriously<00:02:34.450> when<00:02:34.689> you're<00:02:34.810> looking<00:02:35.049> at

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
seriously when you're looking at

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.099 
seriously when you're looking at
Bionicle<00:02:36.430> graphics<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.090> mean<00:02:37.359> it<00:02:37.840> doesn't

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
say that it's gonna be a bad movie I'll

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.949 
say that it's gonna be a bad movie I'll
still<00:02:42.640> watch<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.849> either<00:02:43.120> way<00:02:43.329> it's<00:02:43.510> war<00:02:43.720> ahem

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
still watch it either way it's war ahem

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.330 
still watch it either way it's war ahem
what<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.349> there<00:02:44.470> not<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.189> is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
what is there not to like this is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.710 
what is there not to like this is
something<00:02:45.609> that<00:02:45.639> everyone<00:02:46.090> has<00:02:46.209> wanted<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.540> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
something that everyone has wanted for a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.780 
something that everyone has wanted for a
long<00:02:46.780> time<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.889> why<00:02:47.950> not<00:02:48.099> take<00:02:48.310> advantage<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
long time so why not take advantage of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.890 
long time so why not take advantage of
it<00:02:48.909> know<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.269> it's<00:02:49.389> good

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
it know that it's good

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.429 
it know that it's good
perhaps<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.730> support<00:02:52.180> from<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.540> movie<00:02:52.959> will

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
perhaps the support from this movie will

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.050 
perhaps the support from this movie will
lead<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.980> more<00:02:54.159> movies<00:02:54.519> maybe<00:02:54.670> they<00:02:54.909> won't

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
lead on to more movies maybe they won't

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.670 
lead on to more movies maybe they won't
cover<00:02:55.239> ultramarines<00:02:55.930> anymore<00:02:56.230> maybe<00:02:56.439> they'll

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
cover ultramarines anymore maybe they'll

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.640 
cover ultramarines anymore maybe they'll

you think it might be about capturing a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.649 
you think it might be about capturing a
relic<00:03:18.189> or<00:03:18.280> anything<00:03:18.599> some<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.810> source<00:03:21.659> as

far as the story goes I'm pretty sure

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.390 
far as the story goes I'm pretty sure
it'll<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.629> solid<00:03:26.109> because<00:03:26.440> dad<00:03:26.650> admits<00:03:27.040> behind

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
it'll be solid because dad admits behind

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.559 
it'll be solid because dad admits behind
it<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.699> if<00:03:27.819> you<00:03:27.909> haven't<00:03:28.180> checked<00:03:28.359> out<00:03:28.449> his
