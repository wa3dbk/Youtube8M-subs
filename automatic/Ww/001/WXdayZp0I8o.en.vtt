00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.827
 Valiant is the iconic company in the history of comic books 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.964
 We have sold more than 80 million comic books 

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.734
 We have Rai, XO Manowar, Ninjak 

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.771
 This industry is worth $750 million in the United States 

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.006
 At a global value of $6 billion 

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.643
 We are determined to be the leading independent company in the comic book industry. 

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.447
 Editing is the "wheel" of the production process 

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.716
 And Dropbox is the core 

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:36.453
 Everyone who actually participates in comic creation... 

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:40.457
 Screenwriters, painters, colorists and inlays are freelancers 

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.894
 There are dozens to hundreds of freelancers who work with us. 

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:46.096
 They are distributed throughout the United States, even around the world. 

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.332
 All of us are constantly passing files back and forth 

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:51.001
 All through Dropbox 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.637
 The production of comic books really starts from the typesetting stage. 

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.140
 Painter uploads high-resolution scanned pencils via Dropbox 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.178
 I downloaded it and passed it to the inkmaster, also through Dropbox. 

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:04.381
 Then ink and color, and embed text 

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:07.617
 At the same time, I sent the documents to the colorist in the Philippines. 

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:11.388
 Send black and white paintings to the inlayist in Maryland 

00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:14.091
 Completing a comic is an international cooperation. 

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.094
 Valiant never missed the deadline 

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.696
 Deadline is very important in this industry 

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.898
 A comic book should be printed and published within 30 days. 

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.701
 No matter what happens, it must be completed before the deadline 

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:29.439
 We were unable to get to the office when the snowstorm struck 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.676
 But our fans, they are not necessarily in New York 

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.479
 They will go to the comic book store on Wednesday morning. 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.180
 Looking for the Valiant comics they care about 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.217
 Our production staff works remotely from home 

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:43.854
 They can access the files they need no matter where they are. 

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:47.824
 With the help of Dropbox Enterprise, we finished the work on time and through telecommuting. 

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:52.229
 Exhibition is a major event in the comic book industry 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.930
 We have to attend the show almost every weekend. 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.934
 Exhibitors in addition to doing the exhibition work 

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.504
 Must also handle their daily work 

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:05.142
 Whether they are working on a laptop, iPad or iPhone, they are using Dropbox Enterprise Edition. 

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:07.911
 Dropbox Enterprise gives us flexibility 

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:13.083
 High efficiency, remote working capability and cost-effective solution... 

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.019
 It is for us today in the comic book publishing industry 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.221
 Work laid the technical foundation 

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.525
 Dropbox Enterprise Edition
