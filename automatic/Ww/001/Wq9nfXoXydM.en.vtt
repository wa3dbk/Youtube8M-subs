 Very Few know that you played professional soccer, you think that in the current football we watch 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.020
 on television and in the stadiums do you need more tricks? 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.780
 I think that in football you can watch it for 90 minutes and sometimes you do not see anything, 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 so in this kind of shows, with freestyle, pannas (tunnels) and street soccer 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.240
 you have the opportunity to show people something, 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.900
 and it's another way of playing football that is real football that comes from the streets, 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 because everybody takes the ball, goes out and plays tricks and things like that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.540
 because he has fun with the ball. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.820
 So basically what we do and what I do 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.080
 is to return with the real football that I love since I started, and bring it to the streets. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.020
 Could you summarize your style in a few words? 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.320
 My style is a mixture of many things to say so, 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.400
 I like to communicate with people 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.020
 so my game is to connect with the people in front of me 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.260
 and having fun with them so that's my style ... talking to people. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.860
 We all know that you have visited many places in the world, 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.240
 What do you think is the country where Freestyle is best practiced? 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.260
 Hmm, different countries are good, 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420
 because everyone has different styles ... 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.300
 But I have to say, that in my opinion 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.040
 The best country in Freestyle, and that has its own style ... 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.140
 Japan, because they have very good moves 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.180
 It's Poland also because they have many Freestylers in the top Ranking 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.811
 France, because of course there we have good vibrations 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.320
 nobody practices it like we do there ... 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.020
 and I think Colombia is one of the best because here 

00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:44.613
 all the level of the guys is really strong 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.520
 and especially in the show, I was quite surprised with the talent ... 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.480
 of the Colombian freestyler. 

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:43.389
 How much influence does music have in your freestyle? 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.860
 For me, when you do Freestyle you adapt what there is 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.360
 Around you... 

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:50.942
 So if you're facing people you adapt to that and with them 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.180
 but if in the atmosphere with the people you put some music, 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.360
 if you do not play with that, it's a serious mistake ... 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.100
 because, you know you see, you smell your touch ... 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.320
 but what most influences people is what they hear ... 

00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:04.447
 So if you connect your Freestyle with music 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 it's going to be something great ... 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.540
 because you will reach more people.
