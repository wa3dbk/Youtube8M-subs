00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the people my name is julian title and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.240
 that it's a personal training today 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.920
 is about the top five for exercise 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 massive breast I finally want you times 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.750
 rausholen your workout routine 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 this is all about banking 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 is, so to speak, the absolute for many 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 Base for your bodybuilding for her 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 Acting force is actually possible 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
 bench press monday jsa off to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.930
 bank press so to speak 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.670
 and with me this exercise is only in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.670
 quotes in fifth place 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.850
 Bench press trains in the first place 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.950
 the front shoulders and the triceps 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 Of course the breast but the breast 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 actually only train at bench press 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 Perfect technology and they do that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 least bankrupts pretty much 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
 endangering that means that the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 Executions of bank presses and the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 success that arises from 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 strength level and growing breast in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 no relation to the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.610
 there is a risk of injury you have the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.250
 make technology perfect with it too 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 get a benefit from bankprints 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.579
 So that means the back 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.100
 shoulder blades tighten the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.380
 hold the elbows slightly closer to the body 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.229
 than most do it then slowly 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.570
 Lower to about the lower breast 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 then in the semicircular arc after 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.520
 push up and stretch the arms though 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
 do not break through 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 So bank press on place 5 a top 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.880
 Exercise but the technique has to be right 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.050
 square number four push-ups 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.780
 or push-ups with weight 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.600
 practice an exercise anywhere here 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 if your vacation since or anywhere or 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.890
 the gym have closed from 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 push-ups make wonderful but also 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.940
 here there is a technology almost 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.800
 no one has it that it again 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.800
 contract shoulder blades at the back 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.350
 feet do not feed each other's abdomen 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 be absolutely straight and then they go 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.800
 same also relatively close to the body over 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.240
 the form with those with the far 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.680
 Spreading his elbows he too 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.720
 You have to be careful about the shoulders 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.490
 be that you may have no problems making their 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.570
 keep it quiet but shoulder blades 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.970
 contract back 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.610
 be like a candle and then 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.410
 just distract and top the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.480
 use perfect range of motion 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 no half-push-ups do that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 her super breasts are trained 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 number four 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.970
 push-ups or push-ups with weight 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.489
 As number 3 called diagonally bench press 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.200
 or briefly dumbbell press here 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.530
 the advantage that each arm separately 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.209
 is trained and the normal of the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.100
 Balloons which are almost every body 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.540
 has everything one side stronger is the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.760
 is not undermined here that is 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.830
 So here you can weaken your weaknesses 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.230
 train the breast works great 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.390
 could be in a complete deal 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.100
 come together pyramid-shaped above 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.600
 many rotate so the hands of a 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.220
 formerly also learned still made 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.790
 and never questioned many 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.980
 said okay 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.420
 This creates more tension so I 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.460
 not for the tension if you the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.260
 feels continues to turn 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.720
 in the wrist above agree let it easy 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.760
 so did not formally compress together 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
 rest up too long right back 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.920
 go down nicely in the stretching so 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.050
 far into the rhine and explosive upwards 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
 press is significantly injured 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.400
 roughly as a barbell 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.070
 Bench press should also be a great exercise 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.120
 almost no breast workout is missing short hand 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.980
 or 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.900
 his bank or temporarily 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.570
 wears place on place three 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.130
 Number two, the tips are an absolute 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.380
 ob school exercise will be barely 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.750
 executed or any devices and 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.580
 Machinery makes that please refuse 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.380
 get pretty far ahead of it 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.880
 a right to exist also has one 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.850
 breast exercise to be called if you 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.050
 very upright since he becomes the triceps 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.120
 trained and the front shoulders 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.490
 go lean a bit further forward 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.100
 and you have an absolute top 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.050
 breast exercise when we are so far since circa 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.180
 ten repetitions or 10 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.770
 Do 12 repetitions cleanly 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.860
 you can add some weight 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.690
 and you can weigh yourself too 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.580
 buy the belt where the weight 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.930
 dranhÃ¤ngen or mcfit is there 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.610
 now these are super chains you look at 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.410
 about hangs so I think also absolutely 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.090
 hot 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.690
 and if walls works like perfect and 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.880
 clean 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.650
 then tips are one of the best 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.640
 breast exercise ever and here with me 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.640
 in second place 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.000
 Place number one is the absolute king 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.160
 Exercise for the breast is barbell 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.600
 bench press you have essential 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.280
 less risk of injury than when 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.500
 regular bank press can do it anyway 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.570
 use a lot of weight and with 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.880
 you also demolish the right technology 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.500
 really the chest most naturally 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.540
 in the triceps and then demand blame 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.010
 here but you can significantly here 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.900
 more effective and better on the breast 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.280
 aiming at in my opinion 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.229
 every other breast exercise 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.240
 I often have the problem that customers 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.800
 come to me and say yes my breast 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.600
 does not grow why I make five 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.220
 sets bench press with 400 kilo 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.870
 no it's not like that but 100 kilos or 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.820
 otherwise something and the breast grows 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.970
 not only the poor grow 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.400
 how the shoulders are getting better resp 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.680
 worse in the sense that halt diddy 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.900
 diddy in roda gates are getting stronger and stronger 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.910
 and that is when long hand described 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.039
 Do not bank the case as long as you do 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.590
 Of course, the back evenly 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.690
 trained but the absolute best 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.460
 Exercise heavy weight use behind 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.690
 again the shoulder blades 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.669
 squeeze and then out of this 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.350
 push the movement explosively upwards 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.990
 barbell skewed banks is the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.669
 Absolute top exercise Julian Zietlow top 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.030
 five for the breast is settled on 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.030
 Beach 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.539
 if you ask where are butterfly cape 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.069
 cross and how they are all called more than 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.990
 in almost every other body part 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.870
 are isolation exercises for me 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.880
 the breast is not really off and 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.470
 you are welcome to do that as before 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.270
 fatigue any injuries 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.710
 have and not not bank press 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.020
 are able to execute are are butterfly 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.300
 they are there in the end effect or 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.800
 again as a burnout set or something 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.289
 always one or two 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.819
 once again score really well 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.440
 so you look good from the mirror 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.979
 it's all understandable but as 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.419
 as a basic basis or or as 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.979
 equivalent replacement for example 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.590
 long described bench press lips or 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.690
 I would say something else to use 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.400
 by no means ever again 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.800
 pure like to take as a super set 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.229
 but not as a standalone exercise where 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.120
 you really 15 minutes or otherwise 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.650
 butterfly kebekus spends a long time 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.650
 definitely not the whistle
