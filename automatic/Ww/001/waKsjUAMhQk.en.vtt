 according to the thickness of the line and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.239
 the thicker the lines and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.599
 greater attention should the point be 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.660
 in the fabric increases the voltage if the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.080
 point is tugging fabric decrease 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.080
 attention 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.050
 in electronic machines the points are 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.630
 easy to select, simply press the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.940
 the desired point or choose the number 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.730
 from the point on a table both the 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.670
 length as the width of the points already 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.210
 are automatically suggested and can be 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.280
 be changed according to your need 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.520
 in mechanical machines the selection of 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.590
 points are made per day and the selectors 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.420
 to select them simply rotate or

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.100
 in this case the length adjustment and 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.090
 width is made through points 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:18.350
 phones 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:21.200
 depending on the model of your machine to 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.080
 to remove the shoe raise the shoe

 tighten and tighten the 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.309
 needle 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.589
 there is one needle for each type of 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.929
 fabric and application in the 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:24.689
 instructions you will find a table 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:27.509
 with needle choice guidelines 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.550
 and its proper use is 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.719
 very important for the final result 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.119
 of work 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.689
 following these steps your machine will be 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:40.309
 ready for sewing now just use your
