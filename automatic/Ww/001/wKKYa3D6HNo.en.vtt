00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
Marie who's seems to be training outside
of<00:01:51.689> her<00:01:51.840> comfort<00:01:51.869> zone<00:01:52.280> by<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.490> being<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
of her comfort zone by not being at the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
of her comfort zone by not being at the
performance<00:01:54.600> center<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> sort<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
performance center I think it sort of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
performance center I think it sort of
shows<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> maybe<00:01:56.369> she<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:57.000> does

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
shows you that maybe she really does

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.330 
shows you that maybe she really does
want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.689> better<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> want<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
want to get better at this and want to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.459 
want to get better at this and want to
make<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.670> her<00:01:59.909> career<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:01.049> thought<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
make this her career I have thought that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.740 
make this her career I have thought that
basically<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.219> debit<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.210> signed<00:02:03.509> her

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
basically maybe debit be just signed her

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
basically maybe debit be just signed her
that<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> part<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> total<00:02:05.340> total

for the total divas show you can

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.550 
for the total divas show you can
remember<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.189> Eva<00:02:16.000> Marie<00:02:16.329> scored<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.140> win

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
remember that Eva Marie scored a win

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.649 
remember that Eva Marie scored a win
over<00:02:18.099> AJ<00:02:18.519> Marie<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.879> think<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.269> might<00:02:19.420> have<00:02:19.540> been

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
over AJ Marie I think it might have been

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.199 
over AJ Marie I think it might have been
via<00:02:19.900> count-out<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.769> one<00:02:21.340> way<00:02:21.489> or<00:02:21.700> another<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
via count-out that one way or another it

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.360 
via count-out that one way or another it
was<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> win<00:02:22.840> over<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> Divas<00:02:23.650> Champion<00:02:23.680> at<00:02:24.220> one

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
was a win over the Divas Champion at one

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.089 
was a win over the Divas Champion at one

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.119 
believe she's the three-time champion
already<00:04:08.169> but<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.440> has<00:04:08.590> been<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.829> good<00:04:09.010> little

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
already but it has been a good little

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.830 
already but it has been a good little
while<00:04:09.370> since<00:04:09.579> she's<00:04:09.760> had<00:04:09.909> back<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.479> belt<00:04:10.690> in

her<00:04:10.930> hand<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.379> I<00:04:11.709> think<00:04:11.919> it's<00:04:12.010> gonna<00:04:12.099> be

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
