said<00:00:38.250> before<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.840> sure<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
said before you want to make sure that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139

the water does not touch the piece

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
the water does not touch the piece
because<00:00:43.019> it's<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> leach<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.739> all

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.009 
five minutes and my peas are done now
it's<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.120> important<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.749> don't

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
it's really important that you don't

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.380 
it's really important that you don't
over<00:01:01.320> cook<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.710> peas<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.089> peas<00:01:03.359> are

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
over cook the peas because the peas are

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.720 
over cook the peas because the peas are
full<00:01:03.929> of<00:01:04.199> B<00:01:04.530> vitamins<00:01:04.560> which<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.520> that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
full of B vitamins which are in that

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.820 
full of B vitamins which are in that
bright<00:01:06.030> green<00:01:06.330> color<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.440> overcook

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
bright green color and if you overcook

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.340 
bright green color and if you overcook
it<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.550> vitamins<00:01:08.970> tend<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> degrade<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it then the vitamins tend to degrade so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
it then the vitamins tend to degrade so
this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.190> healthier<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.730> consume

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
this is a much healthier way to consume

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
this is a much healthier way to consume
the<00:01:12.510> piece<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.290> I'm<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> run<00:01:14.100> some

cold<00:01:14.520> water<00:01:14.730> over<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> they're<00:01:15.600> easy<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
cold water over them so they're easy to
