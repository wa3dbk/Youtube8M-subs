anybody can draw a square anybody can
draw<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> triangle<00:00:39.480> next<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> look

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
draw a triangle next I'm going to look

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
draw a triangle next I'm going to look
at<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.070> fingers<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.750> opinion

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
at my fingers and they in my opinion

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.639 
at my fingers and they in my opinion
resemble<00:00:43.980> sausage<00:00:44.550> links<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
resemble sausage links so we're going to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
resemble sausage links so we're going to
break<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.010> fingers<00:00:47.340> down<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.550> sausage

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
break our fingers down into sausage

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.439 
break our fingers down into sausage
links<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.039> there<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.160> three<00:00:50.550> sausage<00:00:51.030> links

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
links and there are three sausage links

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.840 
links and there are three sausage links
for<00:00:51.600> each<00:00:51.809> finger<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.949> sausage<00:00:53.430> links

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
for each finger and two sausage links

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
for each finger and two sausage links
for<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> thumb<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> sausage<00:00:55.739> link<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.190> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
for the thumb so a sausage link is just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
for the thumb so a sausage link is just
basically<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.030> tube<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> cylinder<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.289> I'm

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
basically a tube or a cylinder so I'm

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
basically a tube or a cylinder so I'm
going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> draw<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.250> shapes<00:00:59.280> coming<00:00:59.940> out

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
going to draw these shapes coming out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
going to draw these shapes coming out
I'm<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.379> looking<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.399> hand<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.850> I'm

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I'm also looking at my hand as I'm

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.479 
I'm also looking at my hand as I'm
drawing<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.530> trying<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
drawing I'm not trying to make this up

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
drawing I'm not trying to make this up
as<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.850> along<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.390> using<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.840> hand<00:01:07.140> as

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
as I go along I'm using my hand as

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
as I go along I'm using my hand as
reference<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.640> left<00:01:08.939> hand<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> reference<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
reference my left hand is reference to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980 
reference my left hand is reference to
look<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.130> shapes<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.090> exist<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.869> in

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
look at those shapes that exist there in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.240 
look at those shapes that exist there in
the<00:01:13.110> hand

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the hand

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
the hand
you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.300> draw<00:01:15.480> anything<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.050> want<00:01:16.410> in<00:01:16.620> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you can draw anything you want in the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
you can draw anything you want in the
world<00:01:16.860> by<00:01:17.160> breaking<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.790> into<00:01:17.850> shapes

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
world by breaking it down into shapes

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
world by breaking it down into shapes
it's<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:19.050> rocket<00:01:19.500> science<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.010> very<00:01:20.370> easy

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's not rocket science it's very easy

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's not rocket science it's very easy
so<00:01:21.540> here's<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.930> thumb<00:01:22.230> with<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.010> two<00:01:23.190> sausage

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so here's my thumb with the two sausage

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
so here's my thumb with the two sausage
links<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.510> we've<00:01:24.660> got<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
links on there and now we've got the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.890 
links on there and now we've got the
basic<00:01:25.200> structure<00:01:26.010> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> hand<00:01:26.690> easiest<00:01:27.690> pie

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
basic structure of the hand easiest pie

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.570 
basic structure of the hand easiest pie
now<00:01:28.560> we're<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.830> go<00:01:28.950> back<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> we're

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
now we're going to go back and we're

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.390 
now we're going to go back and we're
going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.760> put<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> contour<00:01:30.690> lines<00:01:31.400> contour
