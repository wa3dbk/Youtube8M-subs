00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to you a very simple way of showing your

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560 
to you a very simple way of showing your
dog<00:00:22.230> exactly<00:00:23.130> where<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.910> where<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
dog exactly where it is and where it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.859 
dog exactly where it is and where it
isn't<00:00:24.779> allowed<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:26.000> Stanley's<00:00:27.000> owners<00:00:27.420> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
isn't allowed to Stanley's owners it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
isn't allowed to Stanley's owners it
seems<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.470> either<00:00:28.710> he<00:00:28.890> doesn't<00:00:29.039> know

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
seems like either he doesn't know

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
seems like either he doesn't know
exactly<00:00:29.699> where<00:00:30.269> he's<00:00:30.390> allowed<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.590> doesn't

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
exactly where he's allowed or he doesn't

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.450 
exactly where he's allowed or he doesn't
care

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
care

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240 
care
I'd<00:00:32.940> suggest<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.130> bit

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I'd suggest it actually is a little bit

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.690 
I'd suggest it actually is a little bit
of<00:00:35.340> both<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> line<00:00:38.250> where<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
of both so this is the line where you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
of both so this is the line where you
don't<00:00:39.030> want<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> dog<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
don't want the dog to go into the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.670 
don't want the dog to go into the
kitchen<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.760> dog<00:00:42.030> can't<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.989> exactly

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
kitchen the dog can't really see exactly

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
kitchen the dog can't really see exactly
where<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.149> our<00:00:45.239> own<00:00:45.450> minds

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
where it is we have it in our own minds

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.619 
where it is we have it in our own minds
as<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> make

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
as to where we think it is but to make

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.500 
as to where we think it is but to make
it<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:49.110> clear<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> dog<00:00:50.360> what<00:00:51.360> we're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it really clear to the dog what we're

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.920 
it really clear to the dog what we're
gonna<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.879> it's<00:00:53.879> crucial<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.600> there's<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gonna do is it's crucial that there's a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
gonna do is it's crucial that there's a
very<00:00:55.199> obvious<00:00:55.379> line<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.670> dog<00:00:56.969> such<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
very obvious line for your dog such as a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
very obvious line for your dog such as a
change<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> floor<00:00:58.710> surface<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.340> wood<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
change in the floor surface from wood to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.029 
change in the floor surface from wood to
carpet<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.899> isn't<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.530> need<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
carpet if there isn't you need to make a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
carpet if there isn't you need to make a
clear<00:01:02.460> dividing<00:01:02.910> line<00:01:03.090> using<00:01:03.930> tape<00:01:04.170> don't

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
clear dividing line using tape don't

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.760 
clear dividing line using tape don't
worry<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.519> doesn't<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.420> forever<00:01:06.770> all

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
worry it doesn't have to be forever all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
worry it doesn't have to be forever all
we're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> encourage

him to come in he already knows for

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.100 
him to come in he already knows for
something<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.710> there's<00:01:19.979> alignment<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> look

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
something up there's alignment so look

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
something up there's alignment so look
at<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.500> haven't<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:22.890> trained<00:01:23.280> him<00:01:23.430> that
