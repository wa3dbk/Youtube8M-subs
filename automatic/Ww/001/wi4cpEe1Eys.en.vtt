still some green left but most of the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
still some green left but most of the
grapes<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.579> turning<00:01:02.910> blue<00:01:03.090> variation<00:01:03.870> now

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
what is that variation is when uh

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
what is that variation is when uh
actually<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> grapes<00:01:06.810> stop

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
growing they start turning color the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.039 
growing they start turning color the
grapes<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.450> softer

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
grapes start getting softer

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
grapes start getting softer
prior<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:10.710> last<00:01:11.010> week<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.490> were<00:01:11.670> all

hard<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.360> green<00:01:12.690> units<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.590> they're

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
hard little green units now they're

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
hard little green units now they're
starting<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.280> softer<00:01:14.760> they're<00:01:14.940> still

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

probably got another thirty to thirty to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
probably got another thirty to thirty to
sixty<00:01:23.369> days<00:01:23.580> max<00:01:24.030> before<00:01:24.299> we'll<00:01:24.570> pick<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
sixty days max before we'll pick this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.120 
sixty days max before we'll pick this
fruit<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.799> starting<00:01:26.010> to

fruit and that's when you're starting to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
fruit and that's when you're starting to
cut<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.340> off<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> put<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.030> out<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
cut them off and put them out right

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.670 
cut them off and put them out right
we're<00:01:27.600> we're<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.780> dropping<00:01:28.140> crop<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
we're we're just dropping crop and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.499 
we're we're just dropping crop and
making<00:01:28.890> sure<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> balance<00:01:30.299> in

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
making sure that we have a balance in

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.570 
making sure that we have a balance in
the<00:01:30.900> vine<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.830> can<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
the vine so that they can all the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.399 
the vine so that they can all the
nutrients<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.000> come<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.960> feed<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
nutrients can come up and we feed the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
nutrients can come up and we feed the
grapes<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.729> too<00:01:35.850> many

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
grapes we don't want to have too many

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
grapes we don't want to have too many
grapes<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.140> too

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
grapes just like we don't to have too

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
grapes just like we don't to have too
many<00:01:37.439> leaves<00:01:37.770> because<00:01:38.220> otherwise<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
many leaves because otherwise all the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.609 
many leaves because otherwise all the
nutrients<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> canopy<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
nutrients are going to the canopy and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.960 
nutrients are going to the canopy and
the<00:01:40.950> grapes<00:01:41.159> aren't<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.580> ripen

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the grapes aren't going to ripen

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
the grapes aren't going to ripen
that's<00:01:42.150> why<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.330> see<00:01:42.659> some<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> vines<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that's why I see some of the vines on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's why I see some of the vines on
the<00:01:43.409> ground<00:01:43.650> too<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.009> exactly<00:01:44.490> we're<00:01:45.240> we're

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the ground too then exactly we're we're

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.510 
the ground too then exactly we're we're
dropping<00:01:45.990> crop<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.650> we're<00:01:46.799> also<00:01:46.890> thinning<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
dropping crop and we're also thinning it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
dropping crop and we're also thinning it
out<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:47.970> doing<00:01:48.090> leaf<00:01:48.420> pulling<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.259> more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
out we're doing leaf pulling get more

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
out we're doing leaf pulling get more
exposure<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.090> balance

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
exposure where we have the right balance

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
exposure where we have the right balance
of<00:01:51.720> leaf<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.409> vine<00:01:52.619> essentially<00:01:53.250> leaf<00:01:53.430> devine

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
of leaf to vine essentially leaf devine

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
of leaf to vine essentially leaf devine
to<00:01:54.329> grapes<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.560> said<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to grapes so that like I said the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.130 
to grapes so that like I said the
nutrients<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.060> opposed<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.720> up<00:01:57.899> here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
nutrients go here as opposed to up here

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.600 
nutrients go here as opposed to up here
some<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.619> look<00:01:58.770> awful<00:01:59.100> ripe<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.460> can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
some of these look awful ripe how can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.460 
some of these look awful ripe how can
you<00:01:59.670> tell<00:01:59.850> when<00:01:59.970> they<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
you tell when they are right well you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.020 
you tell when they are right well you
can<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> refractometer<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.880> way

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
can get a refractometer that's one way

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.660 
can get a refractometer that's one way
you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:03.659> taste<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> handy

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you can do it by taste these are a handy

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can do it by taste these are a handy
little<00:02:05.820> units<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.750> walk<00:02:06.960> around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
little units that we all walk around

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.929 
little units that we all walk around
with<00:02:07.409> them<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.619> our<00:02:07.710> back<00:02:07.860> pocket<00:02:08.279> you<00:02:08.429> just

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
with them in our back pocket you just

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.930 
with them in our back pocket you just
take<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.299> grapes

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.059 

squeeze<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.209> some<00:02:13.810> fruit<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.530> miss<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.890> is

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
squeeze it some fruit and I miss this is

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:25.380 
squeeze it some fruit and I miss this is
not<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:16.080> random<00:02:17.080> sample<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:23.849> these<00:02:24.849> are<00:02:25.090> around

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
not a random sample and these are around

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.520 
not a random sample and these are around
Oh<00:02:25.989> 15<00:02:26.980> 15<00:02:27.520> 3<00:02:27.940> will<00:02:28.660> probably<00:02:29.020> these<00:02:29.319> will<00:02:29.440> be

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
Oh 15 15 3 will probably these will be

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.229 
Oh 15 15 3 will probably these will be
picked<00:02:29.800> probably<00:02:30.130> when<00:02:30.280> they're<00:02:30.430> around<00:02:30.670> 25

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
picked probably when they're around 25

I've<00:02:31.780> got<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> ways<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.140> go<00:02:32.380> they<00:02:32.530> got<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.739> ways<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I've got a ways to go they got a ways to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
I've got a ways to go they got a ways to
guess<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.400> measure<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.819> sugar<00:02:34.060> that's

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
guess the measure of the sugar that's

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.820 
guess the measure of the sugar that's
the<00:02:34.510> measure<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.900> sugar<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.319> bricks<00:02:35.530> level

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the measure the sugar the bricks level

how<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.250> reflects<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> sunlight<00:02:37.300> coming

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
how this reflects the sunlight coming

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.990 
how this reflects the sunlight coming
through<00:02:37.630> exactly<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:39.069> mean<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.550> people

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
through exactly so I mean you can people

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.210 
through exactly so I mean you can people
use<00:02:40.180> these<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.709> diabetics<00:02:41.709> use<00:02:41.890> them<00:02:42.099> for

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
use these for diabetics use them for

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.070 
use these for diabetics use them for
whatever<00:02:42.580> checking<00:02:42.790> their<00:02:43.060> sugar<00:02:43.540> solutions

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
whatever checking their sugar solutions

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.740 
whatever checking their sugar solutions
but<00:02:44.650> uh<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:45.400> something<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:45.910> use<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.390> not

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
but uh it's something that we use if not

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.970 
but uh it's something that we use if not
if<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.050> don't<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> these<00:02:47.709> then

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
if you don't have one of these then

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.710 
if you don't have one of these then
you're<00:02:48.100> going<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> start<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.940> by<00:02:49.060> taste<00:02:49.360> a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.280 
it then you can just taste it though you
can<00:03:00.850> taste<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.420> mean<00:03:01.660> right<00:03:01.810> now<00:03:01.840> these<00:03:02.110> are

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
can taste it I mean right now these are

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.870 
can taste it I mean right now these are
very<00:03:02.319> high<00:03:02.680> acid<00:03:03.100> there's<00:03:03.280> very<00:03:03.489> little<00:03:03.610> sugar

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
very high acid there's very little sugar

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.820 
very high acid there's very little sugar
another<00:03:04.630> way<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.110> let<00:03:05.319> me<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.650> out<00:03:05.799> of

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
another way is let me get this out of

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.910 
another way is let me get this out of
the<00:03:05.920> way<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.030> check<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.709> color<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the way is to check the color of the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.500 
the way is to check the color of the
seed<00:03:09.190> all<00:03:09.580> right<00:03:09.700> those<00:03:09.880> right<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.060> they're

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
seed all right those right now they're

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.750 
seed all right those right now they're
quite<00:03:10.750> green<00:03:11.110> once<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.069> seeds<00:03:12.340> are<00:03:12.549> getting

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
quite green once the seeds are getting

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.160 
quite green once the seeds are getting
riper<00:03:12.970> they're<00:03:13.239> going<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> get<00:03:13.540> brown<00:03:13.840> they'll

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
riper they're going to get brown they'll

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.020 
riper they're going to get brown they'll
as<00:03:14.380> they<00:03:14.530> brown<00:03:14.890> they'll<00:03:15.220> get<00:03:15.400> green<00:03:15.670> towards

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
as they brown they'll get green towards

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.550 
as they brown they'll get green towards
the<00:03:16.150> tips<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.660> after<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.019> they'll<00:03:17.230> be<00:03:17.320> brown

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the tips and after that they'll be brown

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.229 
the tips and after that they'll be brown
all<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.799> way<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.489> one<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> ways<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.150> you

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
all the way so one of the ways if you

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.060 
all the way so one of the ways if you
don't<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.989> technology<00:03:20.140> with<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:20.920> is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
don't have the technology with you is

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.340 
don't have the technology with you is
just<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.640> check<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.000> grapes<00:03:22.209> daily<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.870> start

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
just to check the grapes daily and start

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.259 
just to check the grapes daily and start
looking<00:03:23.470> for<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.459> said<00:03:24.519> we're<00:03:25.060> weeks

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
looking for that like I said we're weeks

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.090 
looking for that like I said we're weeks
away<00:03:25.450> at<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.810> point<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.380> they're<00:03:26.709> very<00:03:26.950> very

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
away at this point so they're very very

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.560 
away at this point so they're very very
green<00:03:27.430> as<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.790> chew<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.329> you're<00:03:28.510> just

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
green as you chew it so you're just

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.970 
green as you chew it so you're just
gonna<00:03:28.750> be<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:28.930> kind<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.470> gummy<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.829> your

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
gonna be just kind of gummy in your

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.900 
gonna be just kind of gummy in your
mouth<00:03:31.140> well<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:32.769> chewy<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.370> gummies

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
mouth well it's it's chewy that gummies

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.729 
mouth well it's it's chewy that gummies
a<00:03:34.000> good<00:03:34.150> word<00:03:34.299> its<00:03:34.720> chewy<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.500> grape

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
a good word its chewy as the grape

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.130 
a good word its chewy as the grape
ripens<00:03:36.310> those<00:03:37.150> seeds<00:03:37.450> will<00:03:37.660> become<00:03:37.930> like

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
ripens those seeds will become like

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.330 
ripens those seeds will become like
grape<00:03:38.410> nuts<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:38.890> don't<00:03:39.040> know<00:03:39.130> if<00:03:39.190> that's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
grape nuts and I don't know if that's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.740 
grape nuts and I don't know if that's
where<00:03:39.489> they<00:03:39.609> got<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.880> name<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.359> they

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
where they got the name but they

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.030 
where they got the name but they
literally<00:03:41.049> that's<00:03:41.380> what<00:03:41.470> they<00:03:41.680> will<00:03:41.799> be<00:03:41.890> like

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
literally that's what they will be like

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.340 
literally that's what they will be like
they'll<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:42.370> crunch<00:03:42.609> up<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.540> break<00:03:43.780> up<00:03:43.959> and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
they'll just crunch up and break up and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.610 
they'll just crunch up and break up and
you<00:03:45.310> won't<00:03:45.489> get<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.730> bitterness<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:47.500> I'm

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
you won't get that bitterness that I'm

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.470 
you won't get that bitterness that I'm
getting<00:03:47.859> right<00:03:48.010> now<00:03:48.130> now<00:03:48.670> see<00:03:48.940> something<00:03:49.329> else

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
getting right now now see something else

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.300 
getting right now now see something else
a<00:03:49.570> lot<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.870> don't<00:03:49.959> realize<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.709> grapes

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
a lot of you don't realize the grapes

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.039 
a lot of you don't realize the grapes
are<00:03:51.549> all<00:03:51.670> right<00:03:51.970> here<00:03:52.209> where<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> vines<00:03:52.810> have

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
are all right here where the vines have

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
are all right here where the vines have
come<00:03:53.320> from<00:03:53.500> last<00:03:53.890> years<00:03:54.100> but<00:03:54.370> they're<00:03:54.850> not<00:03:55.000> up

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
come from last years but they're not up

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.250 
come from last years but they're not up
throughout<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.600> vines<00:03:55.780> are<00:03:55.989> they

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
throughout the vines are they

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.620 
throughout the vines are they
no<00:03:56.470> no<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.579> set<00:03:57.790> them<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.030> way<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.239> they

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
no no but you set them that way so they

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.330 
no no but you set them that way so they
get<00:03:58.810> good<00:03:58.930> exposure<00:03:59.290> they're<00:03:59.739> easier<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.130> pick

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
get good exposure they're easier to pick

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.039 
get good exposure they're easier to pick
and<00:04:00.700> that<00:04:01.030> way<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.209> have<00:04:01.299> your<00:04:01.540> canopy<00:04:01.840> above

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
and that way you have your canopy above

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.750 
and that way you have your canopy above
because<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:03.040> performing<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
because it's it's performing the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460 
because it's it's performing the
photosynthesis<00:04:04.750> that's<00:04:04.959> allowing<00:04:05.350> the

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
photosynthesis that's allowing the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.229 
photosynthesis that's allowing the
grapes<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.799> grow<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.340> they<00:04:06.459> need<00:04:06.609> some<00:04:06.880> leaves

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
grapes to grow so they need some leaves

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.360 
grapes to grow so they need some leaves
to<00:04:07.510> feed<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.170> sugar<00:04:08.410> into<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.739> grape<00:04:08.980> but<00:04:09.190> you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
to feed the sugar into the grape but you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.039 
to feed the sugar into the grape but you
don't<00:04:09.519> need<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.150> vines<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.600> be<00:04:10.690> too<00:04:10.840> long

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
don't need the vines to be too long

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.020 
don't need the vines to be too long
exactly<00:04:11.769> too<00:04:11.950> much<00:04:12.100> vigor<00:04:12.400> means<00:04:12.730> all<00:04:12.910> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
exactly too much vigor means all the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.460 
exactly too much vigor means all the
nutrients<00:04:13.420> are<00:04:13.510> going<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.780> wrong<00:04:13.900> direction

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
nutrients are going the wrong direction

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.870 
nutrients are going the wrong direction
and<00:04:14.620> if<00:04:14.709> it's<00:04:14.829> humid<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.160> also<00:04:15.459> then<00:04:15.639> blocks

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
and if it's humid that also then blocks

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.029 
and if it's humid that also then blocks
air<00:04:16.090> flow<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.479> get<00:04:16.600> diseases<00:04:16.870> exactly<00:04:17.769> so

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
air flow and you get diseases exactly so

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.949 
air flow and you get diseases exactly so
yeah<00:04:18.310> you're<00:04:18.519> trying<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.450> do<00:04:19.599> some<00:04:19.780> leaf

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
yeah you're trying you you do some leaf

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.860 
yeah you're trying you you do some leaf
pulling<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:21.519> make<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.789> where<00:04:21.909> the<00:04:22.000> bunches

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
pulling you make it where the bunches

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.850 
pulling you make it where the bunches
are<00:04:23.020> more<00:04:23.169> visible<00:04:23.409> you<00:04:23.800> don't<00:04:24.070> need<00:04:24.220> too<00:04:24.490> many

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
are more visible you don't need too many
