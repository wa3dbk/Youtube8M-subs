00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.340 
a lot for it to grow but one cool thing
is<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.370> when<00:02:27.090> you're<00:02:27.240> using<00:02:27.450> bone<00:02:27.810> meal<00:02:28.110> or

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
is if when you're using bone meal or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.750 
is if when you're using bone meal or
even<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.740> you're<00:02:28.920> waiting<00:02:29.100> for<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.520> grow

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
even as you're waiting for it to grow

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.690 
even as you're waiting for it to grow
you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.270> choose<00:02:30.800> what<00:02:31.800> berry<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.520> like

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you can choose what berry you want like

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.820 
you can choose what berry you want like
here<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.210> our<00:02:33.330> purple<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.200> harvest<00:02:34.650> them

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
here you see our purple to harvest them

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.500 
here you see our purple to harvest them
you<00:02:35.100> don't<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> break<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.120> root<00:02:36.300> you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
you don't have to break the root you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.020 
you don't have to break the root you
just<00:02:36.810> click<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.650> click<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.430> it's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
just click right click on it and it's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.600 
just click right click on it and it's
going<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.270> give<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.500> fruit<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.190> once<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
going to give you the fruit so once you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
going to give you the fruit so once you
get<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> bush<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.110> keep<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.800> that's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
get a bush you can keep that so that's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.610 
get a bush you can keep that so that's
really<00:02:44.070> good<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.110> wanted<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> show

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
really good and I just wanted to show

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
really good and I just wanted to show
you<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.310> click<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.970> changes<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
you that as you click it it changes the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.540 
you that as you click it it changes the
fruit<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.320> gets<00:02:49.620> bigger<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.920> I'm<00:02:50.160> guessing

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
fruit as it gets bigger so I'm guessing

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.240 
fruit as it gets bigger so I'm guessing
the<00:02:50.670> fruit<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.210> in<00:02:51.780> relation<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> size<00:02:52.800> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the fruit is in relation to the size of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.060 
the fruit is in relation to the size of
the<00:02:53.490> bush<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.990> larger<00:02:55.470> bush<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the bush so a larger bush we have the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.740 
the bush so a larger bush we have the
red<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.800> most<00:02:59.010> largest<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.790> get<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.320> I

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
red and the most largest you get the I

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.300 
red and the most largest you get the I
forgot<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> name<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.530> berry<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.190> was

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
forgot the name of that berry what was

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.190 
forgot the name of that berry what was
that<00:03:05.460> one<00:03:05.670> again<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:07.040> nectarous<00:03:08.040> berry<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
that one again the nectarous berry and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.020 
that one again the nectarous berry and
let<00:03:10.650> me<00:03:10.710> go<00:03:10.920> back<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.460> day<00:03:13.430> what<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.460> have<00:03:14.790> here

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
let me go back to day what I have here

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.550 
let me go back to day what I have here
is<00:03:15.210> besides<00:03:15.810> bone<00:03:16.200> meal<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.800> time<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.730> has<00:03:18.330> a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
is besides bone meal in time it has a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.890 
is besides bone meal in time it has a
different<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.880> weird<00:03:20.880> way<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.510> grow<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
different a weird way you can grow it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
different a weird way you can grow it
where<00:03:22.230> clay<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:24.570> stone<00:03:25.140> acts<00:03:25.560> as<00:03:25.950> a

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
where clay and in stone acts as a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.570 
where clay and in stone acts as a
fertilizer<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.380> has<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.739> be<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.010> third

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
fertilizer and it has to be the third

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.020 
fertilizer and it has to be the third
block<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.620> three<00:03:32.010> blocks<00:03:32.310> down<00:03:32.459> and

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
block so you go three blocks down and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.500 
block so you go three blocks down and
you<00:03:33.330> put<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.110> end<00:03:35.100> stone<00:03:35.510> apparently

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
you put that and end stone apparently

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.050 
you put that and end stone apparently
gives<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.160> faster<00:03:38.540> growing<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.310> yeah<00:03:41.580> look

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
gives you a faster growing and yeah look

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.940 
gives you a faster growing and yeah look
we<00:03:43.050> can<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.270> my<00:03:45.420> imagination<00:03:45.450> or<00:03:46.170> did

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
we can is it just my imagination or did

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.630 
we can is it just my imagination or did
I<00:03:47.070> see<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.400> grow<00:03:47.780> yeah<00:03:48.780> look<00:03:49.020> at<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:50.400> is

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
I see it grow yeah look at this this is

can check out the official growth rate

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.710 
can check out the official growth rate
and<00:03:58.230> what<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.459> stone<00:03:59.850> I<00:03:59.880> know<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.420> stone

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and what the in stone I know in stone

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
gives you a higher growth rate than the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.510 
gives you a higher growth rate than the
clay<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:03.690> either<00:04:04.170> one<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.680> these<00:04:04.860> methods<00:04:05.130> are

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
clay but either one of these methods are

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.750 
clay but either one of these methods are
better<00:04:05.700> than<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.450> dirt<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.190> I'll<00:04:08.190> give
