00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 except when old age is a symbol 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.809
 in the sense that one can be a boy 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.870
 being old and growing peter pan 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 than in us 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 in some respects I believe I am not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.820
 never grown up 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.880
 but when you no longer come to understand 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 certain things means that there is a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.650
 slowdown 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.179
 the slowdown I say is part of the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 life of each of us when one does not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.780
 get more to understand things on the fly 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.390
 means that there is some problem 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 problem for example a problem 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.789
 linguistic 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 today we are in contact with many 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.120
 terms that we didn't know before 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 morning I get up with the nightmare of the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.920
 home spread, but that is analytical but 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.189
 warm up this waste and maybe you houses 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.689
 a cana to cry if they rise 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.720
 knives but I at my age June with 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.720
 said when they left 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 I hear talk 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:28.570
 I hear about pil un pil pil 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.090
 I do not think that the GDP will ever be in crisis 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.149
 well let's say the young lady is mischievous 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.679
 but no, and I'm talking about a product 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.530
 internal gross because the young lady 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:43.220
 knows the gross domestic product for 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 this therefore smiles and then 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 for example, politics is what it was 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.549
 unimaginable today has become real 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.179
 that is, the devil and the holy water are 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.569
 sitting at the same table is unique 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.479
 with owns we believed we have us 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.819
 believed we were coming down to the square we were listening 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.509
 then there is a word that is in fashion that 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.420
 They passed the crisis because they are losing 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.010
 crisis with my wife and there is a bit of 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.430
 crisis 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:22.870
 my son is in crisis but the first 100 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.870
 euro not in crisis to understand 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.959
 to casini that we are in a period of 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.000
 crisis is this is another thing that one 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.069
 he says but I don't understand but meanwhile you have to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 understand and then and then there's what they bring you 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.230
 I told the doctor last time there 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.689
 they put on a diet and then you remember 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.180
 of the friend who invited him to dinner 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.150
 you thought it was better to make him a dress 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.909
 canon from the dinner which started the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.709
 diet was convinced and 13 looks at me 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.889
 I do a diet that does not suffer 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.940
 absolutely hungry but asks you to eat 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:05.510
 giving eat 5 toyota but who eats it 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.609
 morning for milazzo that f 2 slices 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.739
 biscuits there is the specific weight of the 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.889
 lower toast than that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.060
 of the area once I watch out for me 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:23.230
 that is, colonies and rusks to bola 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.760
 two toasted slices are nothing however 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.780
 at 11 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.329

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.579

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.730
 in the evening you keep light on a vegetable 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:04.680
 cooked a lactuca and you are convinced that 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.230

 fate passed just yes but already that 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.389
 we are the people of those who are there 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.090
 Monday 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.000
 then 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.800
 I feel old even when I look 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.520
 this television 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.370
 now they have reinserted carousel 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.800

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.080
 carosello lentini because it is a return to the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.850
 passed because we grew up 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.780
 with a carousel we of ours 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.710
 generation 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:59.760

 because then began belfagor and belfagor 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.070
 that could have traumatized me 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.830
 I saw a belfagor episode from 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.330

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.780

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.539

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:25.340

 otherwise I don't believe that we are 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.740
 grew up with belfagor's nightmare 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.930
 I grew up with a carousel 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.930
 there were these advertisements that lasted 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.410
 a quarter of an hour was a television 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.870
 hypocritical but human there was calindri was not 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.599
 really mean in the traffic 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.229
 with the machines that touched them 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.139
 knees then he took and said china 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:05.139

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.720
 drink a cinardo and we were there ten 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.210
 minutes to feel calindri or stars 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.320
 the star is many millions of millions 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:18.160
 of nichi there were those of the far west and 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:21.340
 today's advertisements are genuinely 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.680
 groveling there is that lady who 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.440
 takes the elevator along with three others 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:31.210
 sir that you know that you piss 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.509
 the other ladies start on 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.509

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.720

 others smell that it was 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.270
 there is another advertising now 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.910

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.660
 absorbent 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.720
 because there is no absorbent that does not have 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.560
 wings but I would like to be about 1 to have 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.680
 the identity as a viral absorbent and then 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.650
