00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
whole biometric fingerprint scanner
there's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.560> devices<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.610> have

been using this even tablets and
computers<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.460> years<00:01:32.880> ago<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.360> used<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
computers from years ago have used this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
computers from years ago have used this
so<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.890> fact<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.369> haven't<00:01:35.549> used<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so the fact that they haven't used it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
so the fact that they haven't used it
but<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.060> been<00:01:36.180> talked<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.720> years<00:01:37.110> and
