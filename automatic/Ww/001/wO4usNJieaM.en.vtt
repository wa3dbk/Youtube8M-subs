 Hello everyone, we are preparing a present for you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.370
 Uzbek dough for samsa 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.559
 we need water you can do on 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 I have a glass of 2 cups 400 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.929
 milliliters of water 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.060
 some water so on we throw 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.640
 salt 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:28.769
 about a little less than a teaspoon further 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 further add flour so now I 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:44.730
 peremeshaem here will dissolve argon involve 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.899
 very cool kids salt dissolved 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 gradually pour the flour will knead 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.680
 dough should make very 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.420
 tight before on dumplings foreigners 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.039
 in general, as I will post, I will show you all 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.580
 make fiction such a dough happened 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.979
 very hard you disturbed minutes 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.950
 ten to fifteen exactly all we are now 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.600
 take him for thirty minutes somewhere in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.790
 the refrigerator and we will roll out 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.869
 thin cake 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.350
 all the dough we had I will divide it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350
 in two parts 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:39.750
 and it is possible and so to become more sti 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 disintegrate 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:02:09.630
 flour from this side of flour we all 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.850
 unrolled here such a reservoir here such 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.260
 it turned out the truth is a little bit not exactly 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.380
 turned out and give you one secret second 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.240
 since I roll this one I was looking for a point 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.510
 we have it first so it test 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.510
 reel 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.940
 That's about it, I'm from here to the cat to him 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.780
 so she turns out very easily 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.090
 expands 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.739
 and if you manually try 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.910
 roll out such a sweet 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:44.250
 it will turn out very difficult for you further 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:48.850
 we do add sunflower oil 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.950
 take a brush and a well-oiled given 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.810
 centuries, as we will lubricate them twist 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.739
 so now we are turning the whole thing 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.739
 take the edge and start here 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
 neatly folded 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:22.690
 and we turn it off as long as we have 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.690
 It will not work like this sausage 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.040
 We dashed off such a sausage now 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:40.970
 it is possible and and so on a little bit 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:43.330
 twist like a towel so she was 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.060
 harder 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:51.230
 copies a large sausage can be divided 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.269
 into two three parts and put in the freezer 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.230
 a couple of hours so she has the dough 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:07.130
 infused and then it will be possible with this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:09.470
 dough sculpt our our samsung so we 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.290
 while we played let me show you how 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.690
 in general, this case is molded 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:24.169
 so well let's say it is steven and a wardrobe 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:24.820
 so cut the part so that later you yourself 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.289
 or drank 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.510
 Here we see that we have turned out 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:35.950
 such beautiful layers hope you 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:41.930
 we see such now we take a piece 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:44.330
 cut off such a piece where we 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:57.560
 the cost turns out we turn over and 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:05:00.370
 so push here and roll flour to us 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.370
 not useful 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.469
 [music] 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:12.039
 this way it will get more 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:14.889
 roll out and we will lower our 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.319
 samsung it to you purely for an example on 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.389
 this allow my idea of ​​cooking dough 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.069
 for males 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.370
 Try to get you fucking samsa 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:35.560
 Uzbek all bye all my dough for 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:37.509
 samsa infused our puffs by the way 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.469
 initially wanted to tell you to shove 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.080
 I originally made dough layers greased 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:46.840
 sunflower oil is a budget 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.319
 option is if you have no 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.789
 margarine houses do not want to go to the store 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.879
 can make sunflower oil and 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.669
 will you have not quite good most 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.580
 awesome option that is used 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.689
 Uzbeks this is margarine its pre 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.689
 will need to melt 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.060
 lubricate our cake then your 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:10.509
 the dough will turn out much better and the layers 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.620
 will be better seen and better 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.689
 rise so but the principle of the text 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.669
 everything 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:22.330
 nothing has forgotten it all all bye 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.229
 take number 2 the other day and again decided 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.490
 make samsa 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:29.409
 here dashed thin tortilla here she 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.839
 we must be dense how to perform 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.389
 and here I will prepare the same margarine 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:36.669
 use margarine you have a hundred times 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.009
 taste better now melt it in 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.960
 microwave 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.500
 but everyone will see that it is melted on 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.120
 grief 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.339
 take a brush and lubricate like that 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.629
 how grease will fold in principle 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.509
 next you already know 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:55.719

00:06:52.509 --> 00:07:00.000
