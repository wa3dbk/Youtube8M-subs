00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 do not 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.940
 hello all boys and girls here good 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.130
 law 'commenting on a new video of 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.550
 john grisham revolution today I wanted them 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.300
 show something that he had discovered and is 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.399
 how to get bone free gems and it's a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.640
 through some trailers that we're going to see 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.370
 right now or very simply they are almost 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.510
 unlimited or I think for every day 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.239
 you can see let's say 20-30 videos and it's a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.210
 by watching a trailer as you can see here 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.210
 that is, you are watching the trailers last 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.740
 between 10 to 10 12 12 seconds and you go 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.960
 gaining bone 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:59.530
 You can earn gems or currency easily 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.210
 that is not going to cost you at all or 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.030
 you just have to see let's say 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.060
 you can do it when you are looking and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.210
 I already have 29 more now we had 28 and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 now we have 29 if they see up there and 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.850
 now let's see the coins I have 38 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.090
 one thousand 994 and now let's see do not have 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.820
 more trailers because I put on I got to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.150
 spend it but basic basically is that 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.120
 to show them I recommend that is 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.100
 let's say I do not want to spend let's say 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.950
 you say do not want to spend on gems 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.050
 not at all good here you have you 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.810
 where alone to the place where the gems or 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.900
 the money leaves them free and there you go 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 you want to leave trailers 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.979
 you do not need internet for 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.830
 trailers so it's a hoot that is 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.440
 of the best and they will get their gems 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.150
 free of charge 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.490
 that is let's say you are seeing 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.800
 television and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.649
 they are going to spend game they want to win gems 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.229

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.130
