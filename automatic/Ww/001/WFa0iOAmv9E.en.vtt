00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.090
 good evening again as i promised by 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 receiving parcels from china with details 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.980
 accordingly prepare the following 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.049
 Here are the first video arrived ordered 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.150
 earlier drivers for stepper motors on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:25.590
 base 49 88 seems to be 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.070
 good enough idea to use them 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.519
 because they are so small 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 compact in all specifications 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.739
 will arrange that is 2 2 amps up to 35 word and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.079
 1 16 micro steps often use them 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.020
 employees I usually try to bypass 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 side of the subculture but in this case 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.050
 It seemed to me very comfortable 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.670
 use of such modules 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.420
 accordingly and ordered also ordered 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.550
 the so-called shield is over the ruin 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 nozzle that allows you to turn 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.989
 I wipe the fee and on a small 3d printer in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.770
 words with three axes and feed the head to me 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 I need it mostly for the test 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.220
 that also seemed very convenient to me 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.830
 first look very successful solution so 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 how is there enough space with 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.000
 the address under the modules is shunt 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.000
 capacitor switches are also available 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.409
 for micro pitch mode, everything seems to be all 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.079
 so comfortable and nice that's all the more price 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.390
 for them gratuitous each module is worth 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.299
 about a half dollar but also all 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.470
 fold folded in deciding to buy them 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.560
 it seemed to be very good but 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.079
 let's start with the fact that in principle 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.920
 The shield is quite comfortable and although they 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.100
 used as an additive to the squad but for 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.229
 for tests it is quite suitable that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.440
 On the negative side there do not have any 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.090
 normal such tags 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 below as you see the inscription will free a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.230
 above there is a little but not closed 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.850
 connectors and it's very easy to confuse which 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.800
 I naturally put the first side 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:16.300
 just put the opposite and one driver 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 stopped working in axis and the second driver 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.330
 has one batted phase it's him old 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.070
 so we have now 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.110
 of the four drivers, two left 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.470
 also included drivers are supplied 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.090
 such radiators on thermo conductive 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.770
 double-sided tape and in principle 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.580
 easy enough cross but not very 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.680
 keeps well on it without leaving yet 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.330
 because in principle its function tee 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.900
 the radiator is still done here small 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.250
 also this is not heated 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.140
 Here I am a little bit here that I finished it 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.360
 additional source of drinking for 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 to be able to test all this 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:07.940
 and here the main has already begun 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:11.239
 disappointment here we have a motor for the test 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.110
 and that's what we got here on 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.970
 a leg 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.800
 step voltage dropped from the button with should 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.220
 to stitch late to enable 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.190
 noise 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.410
 added a suspender and that we can 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.470
 Observe on micro steps clearly you can 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.190
 see that the steps are uneven next to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.540
 datasheet 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.330
 there is nothing about the quality of the step itself 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.720
 that is, these drivers they allow 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.450
 large wide variation in parameters 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 micro step that basically i would even 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.940
 said not acceptable as stepper 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.390
 the motor hurts him comfortably allowing 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.480
 to make 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.150
 and the rosary is a repeatable micro step which 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.580
 allows you to repeat the operation many times with 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.160
 high precision what we are here to 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.760
 Unfortunately, we are not watching 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.970
 I will try if it was hard to see there 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 here you can see how the gap 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.569
 which motor turns on 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.269
 they are uneven 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.090
 yes it is not a classic motor in principle 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:23.060
 and that is, according to the classics, usually for machine tools 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.370
 1 18 degrees per step are used here 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.830
 we have a half but here principle 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.199
 vividly seen in any case so what 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:36.590
 the result does not suit us therefore in 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.270
 I finally ordered drv8825 drivers which 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.229
 also coming soon hope they will 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.380
 Better especially on them datasheet is 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.280
 description with with micro chagas with all 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.620
 parameters 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.139
 let's hope texas instrument us not 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.139
 Thank you all fail to see you soon
