00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.629
 now let's talk right 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.440
 work speed 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.370
 cameras 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.599
 try to turn it on 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.599
 the ensign's body was visible 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230
 now it is ready that is about two seconds 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.800
 to connect 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.390
 a little less skoda and a half 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.489
 so 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.529
 in handing try now 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439
 check speed 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.080
 focusing 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.780
 for this may 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.140
 click on button serov interesting 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 approximate time 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 maybe 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.780
 but it was a second 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 well, less seconds and subject 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 for half a second camera 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 cruising ships 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.140
 can check 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.230
 the job 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 serial shooting 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.500
 here we will be switched for these purposes 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 over manual mode 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.140
 and set 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.800
 yes question 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.800
 Moscow bite 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.600
 generally not bad 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300
 This is true 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.210
 now we will try autograph the role of jack 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 plus term not let's first pro for this 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.380
 need to switch to dollar mode 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.400
 because only in this mode 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.210
 we have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.770
 there is everyone 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 saving enemies 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 uvarov 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.210
 try in this mode 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.249
 that is, not the mother 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.439
 Here the series in this mode is not removed 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.599
 wife of dollars 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.659
 turchak flour squeezed it 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.849
 how not to respond 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.699
 OK 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.499
 0 I think roll 3gpp 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.759
 matter of time is meaningless 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.669
 take off 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.739
 so here 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 working a little bit now change 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.199
 it is a little problem you see 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.009
 that there is some kind of animation aliev like 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.999
 Often you would not press 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.689
 there is some constant speed 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.680
 rendering is animation therefore 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.439
 parade does not go to the next item 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.439
 not yet or drawing a picture 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 and if you scroll through this list wheel 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.819
 then there is no animation in this case and all 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
 occurs less quickly 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.049
 and we can try 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 review footage 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.739
 it can also be viewed quickly 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.149
 do it with a wheel 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.009
 can change 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.009
 scale 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.759
 and scroll like this 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 principle of speed is enough 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.209
 the only thing I would like more here 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.939
 say this product 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.739
 he is focusing in manual mode 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.759
 she looks like 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.309
 very very scary that is here 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.609
 but choose the item manual 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.339
 focusing without pressing anything 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.819
 you have to pull this rocker 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.489
 Europe and only after that here we are 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.569
 goes into manual focus mode 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.689
 which 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.649
 adjusting these wheels 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:07.299
 that is, itâ€™s not that easy 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.779
 to understand is not very strong reason is clear 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.069
 so 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.039
 so 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.289
 worth reading a lot marketing 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.150
 use 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.550
 but the singer is probably all
