00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
like Americans suspicion and paranoia of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
point that people just accept that as a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.330 
point that people just accept that as a
premise<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.590> film<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.130> oh<00:01:11.189> yeah

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
premise for a film and think oh yeah

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:33.160

it's kind of like ghostbusters where the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's kind of like ghostbusters where the
twist<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.600> they're<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.409> fighting<00:01:37.680> ghosts
