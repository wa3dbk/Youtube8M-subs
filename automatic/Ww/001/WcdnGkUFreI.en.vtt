down<00:00:52.969> from<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> ball<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.010> start<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
down from the ball and you start to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.350 
down from the ball and you start to
think<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> being<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> base<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
think about that being the base of the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
think about that being the base of the
skull<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> neck<00:00:58.170> meeting<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> we're

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
skull and the neck meeting that we're

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.549 
skull and the neck meeting that we're
not<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> worry<00:00:59.489> too<00:00:59.550> much<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.850> that

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
not going to worry too much about that

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
not going to worry too much about that
okay<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.670> first<00:01:02.670> we'll<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.210> about

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
okay so first we'll just think about

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.590 
okay so first we'll just think about
what<00:01:03.809> happens<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> face<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.820> someone's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
angry just take plenty of reference draw

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the edges of where the eyes are going to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
the edges of where the eyes are going to
be<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.060> always<00:01:24.840> works<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> between<00:01:25.650> eyes

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
because this kind of gives us the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.320 
because this kind of gives us the
impression<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.459> character<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.790> looking<00:02:38.150> from

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
impression the character is looking from

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
underneath their eyelids and that really

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.600 
underneath their eyelids and that really
really<00:02:42.260> not<00:02:42.560> happy<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.220> take<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
really not happy it's going to take the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.310 
really not happy it's going to take the
brow<00:02:46.820> in<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.330> brow<00:02:47.510> actually<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.959> usually

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
brow in so the brow actually is usually

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.460 
brow in so the brow actually is usually
just<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.860> line<00:02:49.070> with<00:02:49.370> where<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.470> top

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
just about in line with where the top
